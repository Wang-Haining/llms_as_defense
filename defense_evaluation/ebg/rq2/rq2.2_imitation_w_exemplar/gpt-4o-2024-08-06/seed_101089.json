            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the world of negotiations, culture looms large and inscrutable, casting shadows both long and deep. It is a thing as much defined by its absence as by its presence, a wraithlike entity neither singular nor fixed. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are obliging is to draw with too broad a brush on a canvas that demands subtlety. The seasoned negotiator knows well that understanding culture's role is paramount, for it colors each word spoken, each gesture made across the table's expanse. One cannot approach a foreign land without the lens of one's own custom, and in that meeting of worlds, comparisons arise as naturally as breath.\n\nTo fathom another's culture is a journey that traverses history and prejudice alike. It is not for the negotiator to judge or amend but to accept it in its manifold complexities, to navigate its currents whether the tide bears him forth with strength or leaves him adrift in open waters. When one finds oneself in the domain of another, respect is the key that unlocks the gate to understanding, smoothing the jagged edges of cultural divide and paving the way to forward progress.\n\nYet do not be deceived into believing that culture wears solely the guise of national identity. Within a single nation, companies cultivate their own peculiar gardens, each with its own rhythm and rules. Some demand the sacrifice of long hours, while others embrace a gentler pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, in the words exchanged, in the very fabric of their being. Philanthropy may be a calling for some, a controlled endeavor for others. Look to the American firms, each a world unto itself, and you will see the diversity of thought that thrives within the larger framework. Where others may seem uniform to the untrained eye, there lies beneath a complexity awaiting discovery.\n\nAnd so it is with values, the bedrock upon which culture stands. They whisper the reasons why, the guiding lights in a negotiator's path. If honor and harmony hold sway, you will not see a man denounce his kin to gain a foothold at the table. Conversely, a negotiator schooled in the art of the deal may bide his time, unhurried by the rush to resolution. The wise man takes heed of these truths before ever he sits to parley. Yet more than this, he seeks to know his adversary as a man, for it is in the personal that the heart of negotiation beats strongest.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. So begins the psalm and with it the discourse of Anselm, saint of old, pondering the existence of that which men call divine. In the shadow of this belief stands another, Thomas Aquinas, a name woven into the annals of theological debate. We are tasked here with weighing the words of these men, to see whose argument might bear the weight of truth. Yet for this endeavor, we presume both voices speak of the same God, the God of scripture, for to wander from this path would leave us adrift in a sea without anchor. In this light, one might suggest neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a foundation whole and unbroken for belief in the divine.\n\nTo start, we turn to Anselm's meditations—a journey inward, a quest for understanding through faith alone. He tells us of God residing within the confines of human understanding, an existence so entrenched in the mind that to imagine otherwise is folly. Anselm's assertion, though couched in words that twist and turn upon themselves, boils down to this: the proof of God lies within the soul. His voice whispers that truth is a thing found not in the world beyond but within the heart, a faith untainted by the need for external validation. The mind, he says, holds the key.\n\nA different tune sings from the lips of Aquinas. Here is a man who sees God through the lens of reason, through the evidence of things seen and touched. Faith, in his eyes, is a crutch unnecessary for the proof of God. His arguments are fivefold, each a pillar of logic: the movement of things, the chain of causation, the necessity of existence, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the world. He speaks of a puzzle missing a piece, and with the rest assembled, one can discern the shape and nature of the absence without beholding it. Aquinas builds his case upon reason alone, a path laid out for the skeptic and the seeker alike.\n\nIn their words, these men lay out their truths. Anselm finds God within, a whisper in the quiet of the soul. Aquinas seeks him without, in the order of the universe. Yet neither, perhaps, captures the whole of it. The question lingers, unanswered, in the space between.",
            "The authors of the world wield their words like artisans, crafting with care the emotions they wish to instill in the hearts of those who read. Some among them are more adept, their techniques more potent. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel The Great Gatsby, is such a craftsman. He fashions feelings and thoughts through the pairing of adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways, casting an aura upon his subjects. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors among them—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. These hues, once laden with significance, serve to remind the reader of emotions tied to objects of import.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns to the colors white and gray a sense of sameness, with white a touch more refined, gray more worn and faded. From the novel’s start, he lays this groundwork. Daisy and Jordan, draped in white—always in white. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's gathering, Tom a white shirt upon meeting Myrtle, Catherine powdered milky white. Only when Nick gathers his impressions of Gatsby’s revelries do the colors shift, halls gaudy with primary hues. Yet in the everyday, white and gray persist: Nick descends the white chasms of New York, names of Gatsby’s attendees now gray upon his timetable, Catherine’s apartment a slice in a long white cake, uniformity defined. The plain and the mundane bear these colors—Jordan and Daisy's shared white girlhood, the gray cars, gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child, gray, the dog-seller, a gray old man.\n\nOnce the colors white and gray hold meaning enough, Fitzgerald wields them to denote insignificance or conformity. It begins with Daisy, her portrayal after a long absence of these colors, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She is less a person, more a uniform piece, something Gatsby covets. More of this technique surrounds her, the gray haze of her fur collar, her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash, all serving to render her a mere addition, uniform and desired.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County, where the earth is generous and the sky ever blue, the land yields a bounty. Tomatoes and citrus and the dark greens of leafy crops rise from the soil alongside squash and broccoli, herbs of every scent, and the tree fruits—peaches and lemons—that hang like bright promises from their branches. Berries bend the bushes, honey seeps from the combs, and peppers lie in wait beneath the leaves. Here, the earth is kind, and it is no wonder that there is hunger for the organic, for food that ties its roots to the land and offers itself in all its purity. In this place, the farmers labor with their hands and their hearts, their names scrawled on long lists, waiting for a chance to share their harvest. Eggs and milk, too, are sought after, each organic farm a small world where the curious might wander, and birds might be watched and the trails might be walked under the sun's watchful gaze.\n\nYet the cost of this purity is great, for organic farming demands much of those who till the earth. It is labor without respite, a battle with weeds and pests fought without the armor of chemicals. The losses are not small, and the fields do not stretch as far as those of the great farms that spread their shadows across the land. To walk this path is to embrace greater costs, to labor beneath the sun with hands stained by the soil. But in the end, the land is richer, the air sweeter for the lack of poisons, and the creatures of the earth find refuge where once there was none.\n\nIn the shadows of Potrero, a small piece of land sits quiet and waiting. It is a part of the untamed world, where chaparral and grassland and oak woodland hold sway, nestled against the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. This land, 160 acres of it, lies under the watchful eye of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, a promise of protection for the fragile lives that dwell there. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the California gnatcatcher—all find their homes here, their futures uncertain.\n\nOnce, this place was home to those who came before, to the Native Americans whose traces linger in the earth, and later, to the settlers who turned the land to their purposes, ranching cattle and cutting wood. This land, an old homestead, holds the memories of those who came before, their lives etched into the soil.\n\nIn seeking to farm this land, I turned to the pages of the internet, to the listings that spoke of possibility. I sought the knowledge of programs that might ease the burden, that might keep the wild alive while allowing the farmer to thrive. In this, I found a model, an organic farm nearby that stands as testament to what might be, where the land is tended with care and the wild things find sanctuary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers as old as the hills and as unyielding as the earth. Within this bond lies a tapestry of emotions spun from the very threads of their shared blood. Love and pride and jealousy and cruelty. They see in each other a mirror, a reflection truer than any other for it is a reflection of themselves. When the hour grows dark and the world bears down upon them, the nature of this bond comes clear. The cost of such clarity is steep, for in understanding these emotions, one must grapple with the shadows they cast. To look upon a brother and see oneself is to reckon with the truth of one's own spirit, unmarred by the illusions spun by others. In the actions taken and the consequences borne, the essence of their character is revealed. Within \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their journey a tempest of emotion. Through a landscape rich and verdant, they tread a road to futility. Pride and disappointment clash in a storm, and only one shall emerge from the other side. The theme unfurls through the flesh of their interactions, the lens of the protagonist's view, as he wrestles with the world and his place within it. A world that shapes his actions as much as his heart.\n\nIt is pride that drives the protagonist, the kindling of his every act. From the first steps they took together to the final path they walked, pride lay heavy upon him. He bore resentment toward Doodle, for in his dreams he imagined a brother to teach of breath held long, of running, of leaping, or climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high branches of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was fragile, his heart a whisper in the chest of a boy who should not have lived. The dreams of the protagonist crumbled like dust, for such feats were beyond Doodle's reach. And in their ruin, he felt a darkness, a shadow of anger that turned his thoughts to violence. Yet even as he contemplated the unthinkable, the innocence of Doodle's smile melted the ice within him. A simple act, yet it bore the weight of hope, revealing that beneath the surface his love for his brother ran deep and true.",
            "The mind of man, a labyrinthine thing, a vessel of shadows and light, weaving the threads of thought into the tapestry of being. As the ages wore on and man's tools grew from stone to steel, so too did the symbols by which we understood this tangled skein evolve. Once it was but a waxen tablet or a papyrus scroll, a book of days unfurling in the light of the sun. Now they reckon it akin to the machines that hum and whir in the heart of the city. Yet one must tread with care, for these likenesses, though they offer a path, may lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning is the touch, the sound, the light. The world is a chorus of signals, and the mind is the conductor, transforming the raw into the refined. The senses gather their tribute, and the brain, with its silent algorithms, molds the clay of perception. It is a process both simple and profound, from the ground to the heavens. The eye beholds a black box upon a field of white, and the mind assembles the pieces: the color, the line, the space between. This is the work of the bottom, the foundation laid stone by stone. But the mind is swift, and the top guides the hand, recognizing the shape beyond the shadow, a box, not a void.\n\nYet the mind is also a keeper, guarding its gates with vigilance. Not all that comes is worthy of its gaze. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, each a whisper in the wind, but only the name spoken in a crowded room pierces the veil of thought. Attention, the sentinel, decides what shall pass, and the mind bends to its will, the dance of perception ever shifting.\n\nMemory is the storehouse of the mind, where the past is kept like treasures in a chest. There are chambers for the fleeting and the forever, each with its own key. First comes the mark, the impression made, be it the shape of a word or the sound of its name. Then the keeper must hold it fast, an echo in the mind's corridors. The scholars speak of signals weaving through neurons, or of proteins shaping the long halls where memories dwell.\n\nThe knowledge held within is a web, a network of meaning spun across the void. Some say it is a map, each thought a point connected by lines unseen. Here is \"chair,\" and there, \"table,\" with \"wooden\" bridging the distance. In the mind's eye, all is linked, a universe of thought, unfolding in silence.\n\nAnd so the mind goes on, a mystery to itself, seeking to know, to understand the world and its own depths, ever reaching, ever searching.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, a shadow fell upon the great expanse of the United States, a shadow born of financial ruin. A time when the earth itself seemed to shudder under the weight of its own sorrow. Unemployment swelled like a dark tide, the houses that once stood proud and sure crumbled into despair, and the mighty edifices of commerce, those towering behemoths, lay scattered in fragments upon the floor of the world. It was a time of reckoning, and the question that rose from the ashes was this: how had it come to pass, and what might save us from its grasp? \n\nIn the heart of the maelstrom lay a tale of folly, a tale of decisions made in dim-lit halls where shadows whispered of gain and glory. The banks and firms, those temples of currency, were goaded into handing out loans to those ill-prepared for such burdens, loans that were like stones cast into a vast and unyielding sea. And in this sea, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of finance, found themselves ensnared, forced to weave these debts into the intricate tapestries of CDOs and CDSs. When the tide turned and the borrowers found themselves adrift, the banks had no harbor of capital to shelter them, and the storm swept through the land, leaving ruin in its wake. \n\nThe tale's beginning lay in the year of 1999, within the era of Clinton, a leader seeking the embrace of his people, yearning for the warmth of another term. And so he loosened the chains upon lending, setting the stage for a tragedy yet to unfold. Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke then with a voice of prophecy, saying, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's hand, urging it to open its coffers to those of lesser means, while the shareholders demanded their fill of profits.\" And Holmes, with the foresight of a sage, warned of the peril that lay ahead: a reckoning akin to that which befell the savings and loans of yore.\n\nThe storm brewed in many corners, its roots entwined with the newfangled mechanisms of finance. Mortgages that shifted with the wind, securities backed by dreams of shelter, and obligations collateralized until the very soul of the economy was tethered to the whims of the housing market. Households, like gamblers at a table, wagered all upon this fragile edifice, leaving themselves exposed to the cruelties of fate. \n\nAnd when the bubble burst, it was as if the very earth had opened beneath them. The financial giants, those masters of the universe, found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of the land bore debts of $4.1 trillion, a sum vast enough to shadow the nation's own bounty. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was unmade, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were reshaped into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in debt, were seized by the hand of the government in September of 2008, their fate now bound to the will of the state. \n\nSo it was, and so it is told. A tale of hubris and hope, of decisions made in the stillness of night that echoed across the years. A tale of the earth and its people, seeking always to find their way back to the light.",
            "In the quiet corners of a story's unfolding, there lies the place where the writer might weave a tapestry of words, a place where the tale could rise or falter. Here, the prose should sing, but often it drowns in its own excess, leaving the reader adrift, lost in the sea of too many words. There's a woman, Dr. Merlin, who knows the curse of this excess well, for she has been heard to rail against her screen when the burden of information grows too heavy to bear.\n\nExposition, that old betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThe wise know the adage well enough: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in those long-winded passages where nothing stirs or too much unfolds all at once. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay bare the past so you might reach the heart of the tale quicker. But beware the other voice, the one that bids you to recount every childhood memory of each soul that walks through your pages.\n\nTo tell is to lay out the past plainly, in prose unadorned. In the flicker of film, it is when one character pours forth a litany of events, much like a mariner of old recounting his tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nPicture this: a tale where a woman meets her love, they wed in splendor, and then he perishes before her eyes. Such a story should not be penned in haste, two pages for a lifetime, with scant words exchanged between them. The pen should linger on the husband, his words and deeds a testament to the depth of his love. Likewise, the heroine should reveal in her every gesture how profoundly he shaped her world. Only then, when his loss is felt keenly, does the reader mourn with her and find themselves bound closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, one expects the flesh upon the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAnd so, as a weaver of words, it falls to you to craft this flesh. There may come a moment when you wish to hasten, to merely sketch the outlines of a character—a man who once flew among the clouds, now grounded as a night manager at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman on weekends, his secret dream to own the station, having supped on Eggs Benedict that morning.\n\nBut the tale deserves more than a passing glance. It calls for the depth that only careful telling can provide.",
            "In the early light of a somber August morn, the news from Columbus, Ohio, unfolded with the disquiet of an unraveling tapestry. The first tale spun out from NBC 4, of a man named Shad Hostettler, whose visage bore the mark of malevolence. He had taken a blade to his wife in Ashley, Ohio, her name lost in the silence of the broadcast. His image, a shadow cast upon the screen, lingered but a moment, as the story was young and details sparse. They said he had stabbed her many times and now lay shackled by the law. Their telling was brief, a flicker of truth in the waking hours.\n\nThen came the news of a boy, Travis Buyers, just eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in Sharon Woods. A bullet had found him, and the emptiness of the street held no answers, no one to blame. The SWAT Team prowled the crime, a funeral march in the dawn. The story slipped by, a whisper in the ether, for Travis was a black boy, his plight swallowed by the void. The world, it seemed, turned its gaze elsewhere. I have seen this before, the neglect of those who wear the skin of night. But if it were a white child taken, the cries would echo through the hills.\n\nFurther along the path of words came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, wings marred by a sniper's shot. A .22 caliber, they said, a phantom bullet in the sky. Crime-Stoppers called for justice, offering riches for the truth. \n\nThe rain too had its moment, the storms poised to break upon the earth come Saturday's end. The heat would cling to the weekend, they said, a prelude to keep eyes on the screen. \n\nA Clime Road UDF had been robbed, a shadow in a hoodie, they claimed, a man of dark skin, tall and lean. Their voices lingered on his color, as though it were a banner unfurled. \n\nAnd there was Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in the halls of justice. A kingpin of drugs from Texas, they said, his empire reaching to Ohio. Twenty-five years behind bars, yet they spoke of 300 months, a curious choice of words. He was Hispanic, they noted, though the tale had no need of it. A detail thrown like dice upon the table, its purpose lost in the telling.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, stands as a curious beast in the realm of securities. It traces the path of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet it moves with the freedom of a stock upon the exchange. Like some mercurial creature, it offers the breadth of an index fund, yet the singular focus of a lone stock, allowing a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to grasp as little as one share in his hand. The allure is undeniable, with expense ratios whispering their lowly song, far beneath those of the usual mutual fund. Yet, like all things in this world, there are shadows cast. Commissions cling to trades involving ETFs, as they do with stocks, a toll paid to the guardians of the market. But the bounty is rich, the variety of funds as vast as the prairie sky. For the astute wanderer of finance, it's wise to test the promised treasures, to see if the riches of diversification truly lie within, and to what extent they shine. In this pursuit, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, measuring it against the ten stalwarts that form its heart, to see if the wealth of a solitary ETF matches the spread of a diverse portfolio of ten, or if there lies a better gathering of stocks, a more bountiful harvest of return.\n\nTo weigh the value of this ETF, we shan't burden ourselves with the entirety of its holdings, choosing instead the top ten, which account for a sturdy 63.58 percent of its assets. Below, the names of these ten and the weight they carry.\n\nIn seeking to understand how these ten stocks mirror the spirit of the ETF IHF, we can use the current percentage of assets, tempered to a full hundred, to reckon each stock's gift to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely made of these ten, aligned as the ETF has drawn them. The numbers, their truths laid bare, follow in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a tale unfolds. A portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent richer than the ETF, a bounty grown by 16 percent. The Beta, that measure of risk, sits .12 lower than that of the ETF entire. Thus far, the path of the ten might promise more gold with less peril. Yet, the specter of uncertainty remains, for it might be that the means of these two collections are not so different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern if these paths truly diverge, we must measure the variance of each of the ten stocks, each brought to the same scale, to compare their gathered variance to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the darkening months of the year, when the world turns inward and the frost seals the earth, there was a notable waning in the entries of the commuter logs, as if the very spirit of the undertaking had been smothered by the bleakness of winter. It was a thing to ponder, the reasons elusive as smoke on the wind. The cold had come, biting, to the New England campus, and it seemed to drive the people from their bicycles and their paths, back to the warmth of their cloistered lives, away from the open air where the breath is visible before the mouth in ghostly plumes. December, too, is a month of reckoning, a time when scholars and educators alike are bound up in the fever of final tasks, their minds a whirl of grades and closing acts. The simple act of recording their transit fell away from them, lost to the shadows of pressing duties. Then comes the holiday tide, the world turned over to celebration and pause, the halls empty themselves of their inhabitants, who are drawn away to their own sanctuaries, far from the tasks of academia.\n\nAnd so, with the coming of the spring semester in January's late days, one might expect a return, a resurgence of purpose. Yet February was a barren month for logs, the emptiness unexplained by reason alone. Perhaps it is the nature of such endeavors, to blaze brightly at inception and then to flicker as the days wear on. To stir the embers, we conjured the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a breath of life into the fading project, and for a time the logs filled again. The challenge then, as we found, was to sustain the fire through the quiet times, through the breaks and the lulls that are the very rhythm of the academic year.\n\nThere is another truth, deep and woven into the fabric of our lives—the allure of the automobile, the freedom it promises. It is a part of us, this independence, and so to draw folk away from their beloved cars, we offered gifts. Certificates for meals and coffee, for books and massages, small tokens to entice. Yet one wonders what might have been, had we offered greater temptations—a bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car. The prizes held steady through our months, and perhaps therein lay a misstep. Had we promised more as the year drew on, the engagement might have swelled. In December, a bicycle perhaps, and in the new year, a car that whispers of a future kinder to the earth. Such dreams might have kept the spark alive.",
            "In the dim chambers of memory, I found myself wandering through the archival corridors of the Library of Congress, seeking out the early Edison films—a collection of trickery captured from 1895 to 1901. These films, fifteen in their number, spun illusions through the deft hand of creative editing. My gaze was drawn to the poetics of these early trick films, noting the evolution that marked the outliers which dared to step beyond the bounds of their time. There was a steadfastness to these trick films, each one confined within its set, framed by the unyielding proscenium, the lens unmoving, capturing long and medium shots, each one a solitary vision. Yet, at the dawn of a new century, a few dared to defy, weaving multiple shots into their fabric. \n\nWhat you see often in these films is a stage, an interior set that holds its ground, the camera fixed as if it were a sentinel. It does not stir to follow the actors who move side to side, tethered to the stage like marionettes. Such was the way of the world then, the celluloid borrowing from the theater, from vaudeville and the art of illusion. The stage, it seems, was a cage, holding the performers from straying towards the camera, from breaching the fourth wall. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the players dance along the horizontal plane, never advancing, never retreating, and the camera holds its watch, unmoving. \n\nThis proscenium composition casts the shots in long takes, seldom granting the intimacy of a medium shot. Close-ups are a stranger in this world, the audience left to witness the performance in its entirety, as if seated in the velvet shadows of a theater. Actors remain distant, middle ground their domain, never venturing closer to the lens that captures them. \n\nIn these early days, each film a solitary shot, a single breath caught on film. These trick films, brief as a flicker, often mere minutes in length, constrained by the ceaseless ticking of frames. Their stories, if they can be called such, are but glimpses of vaudeville—magic acts, vanishing acts, transformations caught in the spotlight. Yet, within this singular shot in the viewer's eye, lies a truth unspoken—a dance of cuts and splices to conjure the apparition, to vanish the seen. Witness The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), and you may discern the seam where the magic is stitched, though to the eye it is as one.",
            "In the realm of the Gothic Novel, there exists a peculiar conundrum, an oxymoron of sorts, the \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt names it in his musings on the genre's rise. This Gothic mode has been both scorned and revered, condemned for its shallow roots and exalted for the terrible sublime it conjures, as Burke might say. The first of its kind, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of the ancient and the modern, birthing a new order of literary expression. Walpole reached back to the old stagecraft and intertwined it with the mimicry of nature that the modern novel embraced, calling it \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre, steeped in echoes of medieval theater and architecture, carried the weight of old traditions. Even in Otranto's time, \"gothic\" was a word bandied about to describe a myriad of peoples, styles, and epochs. It was seen as relic-like, unsophisticated beside the gleaming advancements of modern society and literature. Yet, it is this blend of the old, theatrical Gothic with the new narrative form, offering an intimate glimpse into the psyche of its characters, that allows the Gothic to endure, to be at once obsolete and novel to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmong the tenets of the Gothic is the notion of Chivalry—an idea both preserved and reshaped in Walpole's tale. This medieval code, the making of a knight both brave and just, was a beacon for Gothic scribes, representing an ideal lost to the ages. Walpole, writing amidst political tumult and shadowed by accusations, clung to this vision of chivalric virtue, perhaps sensing its absence in his own world. Within his pages, characters like Frederic embody this ideal, appearing as the paragon of knightly virtue, a prince marked by suffering and tragedy, thought to have fallen to infidels. Here is the gallant and courteous Knight, exaggerated in form, setting the stage for the Gothic's future dalliance with excess.",
            "The world of supply chains is a silent orchestration, a stream of processes that move like a river through the landscape of commerce. From the moment a customer places an order, the journey of goods begins, winding its way through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until it reaches the waiting hands of the consumer. It was in the pale light of 1982 that Keith Oliver, a consultant, gave a name to this intricate dance—supply chain management. He spoke of the planning, the execution, and the oversight that is required to meet the needs of customers swiftly and without falter.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast structure rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools by which managers craft their art, each decision a brushstroke on the canvas of customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins, the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Here, the when and the why, the where and the how, all take shape. Managers look to the market, that ever-shifting sea, to discern the desires of the customer. They read its currents and decide what should be made and how much of it. The place of creation is chosen with care, each plant selected for its ability to meet the demands of volume and quality, with the customer's satisfaction as the guiding star. Workloads are scheduled, machines are readied, and the wheels of production turn. Every detail is a thread in the tapestry, for if any are missed, the cost, in time and money, could be great.\n\nI remember my own time at Wal-Mart and Target, those sprawling empires of retail. Each had its own design, a booklet, a process for every part of the business. A uniform laid out just so, shipments received with a precision that left no room for error. These outlines, these maps, they allowed the company to move smoothly, without the confusion that so often accompanies a lack of direction.\n\nThe next pillar is supply, a realm of strategic decisions that determine the core capabilities of a facility. From these decisions, partnerships grow, some within the company, others outsourced to those beyond its walls. Each division, each piece of equipment, each worker, all are chosen for their fit in this grand design. Sometimes, work is handed to others, a choice made in the name of velocity—the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. It is a decision made in the quiet of a manager's mind, a choice that sends ripples across the surface, unseen but felt.\n\nIn this world of interwoven paths and unseen connections, the supply chain moves ever forward, a testament to the silent artistry of those who guide it.",
            "In the heart of Victorian literature lies an intricate tapestry woven with meticulous detail and an unwavering gaze upon the aristocracy. Yet, among these grand narratives, two novels stand apart, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each straying from the beaten path, weaving mystery and the bizarre into their fabric. This deviation lends a peculiar strength to their characters, unraveling the depths of their motives and baring the raw sinew of their emotions. \n\nThere comes a passage in Oliver Twist where bewilderment and confusion clamber over the mind like shadowy specters. Young Oliver finds himself ensnared between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices lingering in his ears, a dreamlike echo of reality. He speaks to them as if they were there, flesh and bone, until suddenly the crack of gunfire shatters the air. Cries and shouts rise up, a tumult of noise and light, as unseen hands whisk him away. Through this tempest of visions, an unrelenting pain gnaws at him, a torment unending.\n\nThe novel drifts into these dreamscapes, these ethereal realms, to unearth truths buried within Oliver, to peel back the layers of what torments him, and to reveal his understanding of the world’s grim visage. When the gunshot that felled Oliver returns to the fore in chapter 28, it is relived in a vivid, dreamlike state. The experience underscores the powerlessness that grips him, the precarious state of his health reflected in the spectral figures of Sikes and Crackit that haunt his fevered mind. The gunshot overwhelms him, his senses dulled, and yet he feels the unseen hand that carries him, a constant pain now intertwined with fear, not the surprise of a sudden wound. There arises the question of whose hand guides this misfortune, for it is not Oliver’s own. This event fortifies the notion of his helplessness, a boy adrift, unable to seize the reins of fate even as his life hangs by a thread. A creeping despair gnaws at him, as if old Fagin has begun to weave his dark spell, sapping Oliver’s will to fight, bending him to this despair, shackling his spirit. For otherwise, one might think Oliver would strive, if only for the preservation of his own life.\n\nAs one day bleeds into the next, night descends, a cloak of dread. Time stretches and contracts, a silence both endless and fleeting, each hour slipping by like a ghost in the dark.",
            "In the days gone by, I found myself working in a place that was a tether for young minds, a sanctuary in the after hours where children sought knowledge. They came with their books and their questions, and I did my part to guide them through the labyrinth of words and numbers. My realm was English, the art of reading, and it was there that I was summoned to aid a boy named Adrian. His troubles with words were peculiar, a mystery wrapped in the simplicity of childhood. Some letters he conquered with ease, while others eluded him like shadows in the twilight. He was a child of Latino descent, his tongue fluent in the language of this land, yet there was a chasm in his reading that we could not bridge. \n\nIt was not until his mother came that the fog lifted. She spoke only in her native tongue, Spanish, and with my meager grasp of her language, we managed to communicate. And it was then that the truth came to me, simple and profound as any revelation. Adrian did not falter in reading; he merely stumbled upon an alphabet unfamiliar to his home. Whether this realization changed his path, I cannot say. But I hold hope that the boy found his way.\n\nI tell this tale to shed a light on the barriers that rise in the halls of learning, especially here in California. It is a reminder that the obstacle is not always as it seems. Even a child fluent in the spoken word may find reading to be a mountain steep and unyielding. The problem is known to all, yet the solution remains elusive. For Adrian, the answer lay in tutoring, a simple path through the maze of letters and sounds. But for many, the journey is more complex, with no single beacon to guide the way. The truth is woven in the tapestry of dual language systems, immersion, tutors, and ESL classes. None alone can mend the breach; together, they hold the key.\n\nThe dual language system, an idea with promise, not just for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs rise above their peers. Yet fear cloaks this idea, whispers of wasted resources and benefits lost on the many. But this is not the truth. If such programs were the rule, not the exception, all would find gain in their embrace. But how do we traverse this path? Should we demand all teachers to speak in two tongues? Such a notion is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot have those who walk beside the children, guides fluent in both worlds, to aid them on their journey.",
            "From the time we are small, they tell us of a world beyond our own, vast and unfathomable, a realm of mystery where answers are sought in the pews of the faithful or in the silent chambers of the heart. Some of us take with open hands the doctrines handed down by our kin, while others turn away, denying the beyond in favor of a solitary universe where the self reigns supreme. We wander from one creed to another, casting off the old like a snake shedding its skin, always searching for a meaning that fits. We seek not just the light but the shape of ourselves that this light might reveal, a beacon against the encroaching dark.\n\nA cardinal, my father whispered when I asked him which bird sang sweetest to his soul. We sat there on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin above like the slow march of time. Smoke curled upward from our cigarettes, mingling with the damp air. The rainwater coursed down the gutters, drowning the flowers at the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes lost in some distant place, memories flickering like shadows on a cave wall. His frame had withered, clothes hanging loose on his thinning body, hair sparse as the leaves in November. He looked past me, through me, and I felt the chill of solitude, the words lodged in my throat unspoken, for to speak them was to give truth to the fear gnawing at my heart. I drew close, and together we watched the June rain fall, a silent communion.\n\nThe December that followed stole him away, five days beyond the mark of my twenty-second year. The treatments had carved more time from the stone, yet the worth of those days lay heavy with suffering. What kind of God, I wondered, metes out such cruelty? In the stillness of night, I found no solace in prayer, the thought of a listening deity long since abandoned.\n\nI could not bear witness to his crossing from this life to the next. I chose not to. I wished to hold in my heart the father who lived, not the shadow of his leaving. I knew him better than any, better than those who gathered to mark his passing, and knew he would not have wanted his child to see the light fade. Alone, I curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the words that never came.\n\nNo one called. The world turned, indifferent.",
            "In the quiet vastness of fields stretching far and wide lay the heart and mind of John Taylor of Caroline, a man bound to the soil and the creed of Republicanism. His hands, once upon plowshares, turned briefly to the affairs of state, crafting a voice unyielding in its clamor for freedom's breadth and the restraint of government. His was a vision rooted deep in the earth, an agrarian truth shaping his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the laws that govern men.\n\nTaylor saw in the burgeoning land of America a canvas unmarked by the traditions of old, a place where the ideal of self-rule might flourish. He spoke of natural rights, bound inexorably one to another, each fragile as a sparrow's wing, and should one be clipped, the others falter and fall. These rights, he argued, must remain untouched by the hands of governance. In the wild state of nature, strength and cunning reigned supreme, yet in the realm of civilization, such a hierarchy must not stand.\n\nTo forge his vision of society, Taylor called for a governance that acknowledged the light and shadow within each soul. He held steadfast to a morality of duality, proclaiming that as men wielded power, their virtues and vices were but reflections of themselves. Good governance, he claimed, lay in the safeguarding of property, the nurturing of the land, and the tempering of unchecked capitalism. Though all men were driven by self-interest, it was only sin when it transgressed beyond the welfare of the commonweal into realms of exploitation. A righteous government would bind man's darker intents, though it too must be watched lest it stray into wickedness.\n\nIn the manner of the staunch Republicans of his age, Taylor demanded a strict reading of the Constitution, a Federal power constrained by the words therein, no more, no less. For a sprawling Federal reach was costly and prone to tyranny. Yet he knew that mere literalism was fraught with peril, a path to corruption unless the spirit of the framers guided its course. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true covenant, for it spoke plainly of a union of sovereign states, not a single nation.\n\nThus, John Taylor stood, a man of the land, his ideals as wide as the horizon, as enduring as the earth beneath his feet, ever guarding the fragile balance between liberty and authority.",
            "He stood there staring downwards, his mind a blank canvas trying to comprehend the sight before him. Unfeeling, silent, the practiced gaze of one who observes without attaching meaning, his mind dissected the scene laid out before his eyes. Thoughts drifted in and out, faster than they came, seamless and smooth, leaving him to wonder if they were his thoughts at all or merely a stream of consciousness that flowed unbidden through his being.\n\nThere was a time, long ago, when an artist he'd known told him to buy a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He'd sought to learn the art of drawing since he was a child of six, and the book promised to teach everything from the understanding of a pencil to the brain's perception of lines. One lesson it taught was to encase any image within a square frame, turning the chaos of a complex view—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room—into something simple and comprehensible. That bowl of fruit on a plain, uncomplicated plane.\n\nYet now, as he gazed down at the bowl before him, he found no such frame in his mind. Overwhelmed, awed, he could do nothing but stand there, wonderstruck. They spoke of Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of green, the Renaissance masters' spectrum of color. If he fancied himself worthy of the Artistic, then before him lay the genesis of his canvas, the inception of his tale, his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips brushed the tool of his artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind taking form in what might have been the most creative moment of his life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off to oblivion. His muscles tensed again, more swiftly, more anxiously, as his hand struck once more at the lever. But the stubborn brown mass clung to the bowl's bottom like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a foot apart, the green tie uncomfortably tight around his neck, he frowned at the crude parcel of processed animal and plant left as a message for the hapless souls tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand reached for the wall, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "In the dim corridors of the world, young souls find themselves behind the wheel, where the shadows of fate and inexperience converge. The youngest among us, these tender drivers, are caught in a deadly dance, a tapestry of statistics woven with the threads of their youth. The National Institutes of Health speak of this, a tale told by the very architecture of the adolescent mind, unready for the perils that lie in wait on the open road. Inexperience, too, is a silent companion, whispering of rollovers and roads left behind, of speed that outpaces wisdom.\n\nIn the company of their peers, they fare worse still, a truth known by any with a flicker of insight. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation, a grim ledger of age against the tally of accidents. California, among others, seeks to shield them, crafting provisional licenses to bind their hours and bar their young companions. Yet these measures are but fleeting gestures against the storm. The truth of it is stark: these youngest travelers, by any reckoning, are ill-equipped for the burdens they bear.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze further, deeming eighteen too tender an age. USA Today echoes his findings, of a yearning in those beneath nineteen for the thrill of risk, a hunger that outpaces caution. And so, reason whispers of delay, of holding back the keys until the fires of youthful daring cool. Elsewise, we face a future of lives scattered on the asphalt, a toll of loss that threatens to climb, as the children of Baby Boomers come of age, a legion ready to claim the road.\n\nThe path forward is clear and unbarred by complexity. Schools might still teach the ways of the wheel, planting seeds for drivers yet to come. But the road itself would wait for those under eighteen, a privilege postponed. A provisional permit, a precursor to full freedom, could be their guide, with hours of training to temper the journey. The number of these hours might echo the requirements of states like California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nThe specter of youth behind the wheel spans the nation, and so should our response. Uniform laws, national in their reach, could shield our young from coast to coast. In this, there is nothing new, only the quiet wisdom of prevention, a shield raised against the dark.",
            "In the dry and clinical corridors of understanding, this paper walks through the shadowed paths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known to some as CAPD. It first sets forth a definition, brief as the breath of a dying wind. Then it turns to the matter of diagnosis, laying out the common signs, the red flags, as they are known. Lastly, it speaks to the teachers, those guides in the mainstream classrooms, on how they might shepherd a student afflicted with this disorder.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or by another name Auditory Processing Disorder, whispers of the workings of the central nervous system, the brain's dance with sounds. It is the efficiency, the effectiveness, with which this system uses what is heard. Narrowly drawn, (C)AP concerns itself with how the central nervous system perceives auditory information, the neurobiological chorus behind this, and the strange electric potentials that it births. Simply, it is a disorder where the brain, the very seat of our understanding, cannot properly weave the sounds into meaning. Those who carry this burden hear as others do, and thus are not named among the hearing impaired; rather, it is the brain's translation of sound, the separation of words from noise, that falters.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder trace back to the mid-1950s, spoken of then as \"auditory imperception.\" It was a time when researchers turned their gaze to children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian trio, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began crafting tests for such children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, crafting a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system, the CANS, that underlies dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 stirred the waters of research further, drawing attention to children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows itself in manifold ways. Those touched by it may find sound an elusive specter, unable to place it in space. They may struggle to tell apart two or more acoustic events, each sound occurrence a puzzle. Recognizing sound patterns may elude them, and detecting changes in speech, the subtle sarcasm that rides on a change of voice, may pass unheard. One sound might be swallowed by another. They may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues, interpreting them in a way that invites action, and might also be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, one must peer through a lens of systematic observation, watching the listening behaviors and performance on tests of auditory function. A host of voices—those of audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others—use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. This may be done with questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the patient responds to stimuli. Yet, as of now, there is no singular instrument, no test wielded with consistent success, and the cause of the disorder remains a mystery. Many tests present the patient with a cacophony of simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to pick out certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests listen to the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses to these acoustic signals.",
            "In the quiet corridors of my aspirations, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, a calling whispered by the winds of compassion and resolve. My heart beats to the rhythm of service, a cadence of respect and ethics, a melody of commitment not just for others but for the growth of my own soul. These values stand as sentinels in my journey toward aiding the Division of Family and Children Services, where I seek to be a beacon for children lost in the shadows of neglect and a guide for families wandering amidst their own storms.\n\nIn my early days, the direction was uncertain, a landscape of choices veiled in mist. High school and college unfolded, revealing to me a world where many fled from their demons, seeking solace in illusions that offered none. In these moments, I chose psychology, a lens to peer into the human heart. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in that summer of 2009, I found myself at a crossroads, the road ahead obscured until fate intervened.\n\nIt was a day like any other when I met a boy, sixteen and burdened by the weight of his home. He sat on the couch, the air heavy with the silent cries of his spirit. His tale was one of escape from hands that should have nurtured but instead brought harm. The law stood silent, impotent in the face of his cries, and so I stepped forward, my voice a plea for understanding. I spoke to the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses, each thread woven with denial. It was then, amidst the echoes of that encounter, that the path of social work unfurled before me, a road paved with the resolve to untangle such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nJustice, a word often spoken and seldom understood, burns in me like a flame unyielding. Society, in its contradictions, lauds the individual yet molds us in its image. In my defiance, I have colored my hair in hues unnatural, worn garments that spoke my truth, pierced the ears of convention, and stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tides of prejudice. I am an individual, bound not by the chains of tradition but by the call of justice. My journey will continue, a protest against the injustices that stain our world.\n\nAnd so I walk this path, a wanderer with purpose. Each step echoes with the resolve to heal, to guide, to uplift. For in the end, it is not the road we travel but the lives we touch that define us.",
            "In the depths of night, when the world lay shrouded in a quietude so absolute, there stirred a restlessness born not of choice but of the very marrow of one’s being. This paper delves into the realm of insomnia, exploring the paths carved by the Biological and Sociocultural models upon the landscape of this affliction. The Biological model speaks of the whispers of ancestry in the blood, of genetic blueprints passed down, of the corporeal maladies that bind us. In contrast, the Sociocultural model weaves its tale of the world without, of the ties tethered to the air we breathe, the lands we walk, the myriad faces and stories that shape our lives. It is here that we lay bare the findings, dissecting each study, each scrap of knowledge, to better illuminate the models’ truths, their flaws and their merits.\n\nA sleep disorder, a specter that shadows the mind, may arise as a solitary beast, or it may be the handmaiden of other specters, other disorders that dwell within the psyche. These primal sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, they speak of nights where the body rebels, where sleep neither comes nor stays, or where it comes unbidden, like a thief in the night. Dyssomnias, they are sleep's betrayals—Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy with its sudden surrender to the abyss, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the misaligned rhythms of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the vagueness of Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias, they are the dreams that walk the earth—Nightmare Disorder, the terrors, the somnambulist's path, each a tale of sleep entwined with waking. And there are others, linked to the disorders of mind, the Axis I and Axis II maladies, where sleep is but another casualty. This review, it peers into the heart of insomnia, seeking the threads of these models amidst the tangle.\n\nIn the Biological model, the tale is one of the flesh and the blood, of the genes that sing in silent harmony, shaping the night’s repose. Neurons nestled within the hypothalamus, they hold the key, the orexin that orchestrates the dance of sleep and wakefulness. In the laboratory's sterile light, they watched the mice, saw how phenotypic GABAB receptors played their part upon the orexin neurons. The activation of these receptors, by GABAA, a siren song that lulls to sleep. When silenced, anxiety slumbers and sleep takes hold. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, it stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, they whisper of a kinship between the mouse and the human, a shared fate written in the genetic code. The absence or flaw of this receptor, it could spell a lifetime of nights unfulfilled without the balm of medicine. And in the Sociocultural sphere, the implications ripple outward. If this trait be inherited, then it shapes a life, a destiny where sleep is elusive, where the waking hours grow heavy with fatigue, casting shadows over the endeavors of life, the labor and the mundane.\n\nThus is the story told, of insomnia through the lens of these models, a tapestry woven of the threads of biology and the patterns of the world beyond.",
            "In the time since I've taken root here at University Park, near three years now or the span of four and a half semesters, I've come to know the lay of the land, its paths and ways, and found them wanting. For many, myself included, the act of moving from one end of this sprawling campus to the other is fraught with challenges. Back in my freshman days they set me down in an East Halls dormitory, a place so far flung it lay nearly at the eastern edge of the campus, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from Stuart Hall, my abode, to the likes of the Willard building, toward the heart of campus, could stretch nigh to a half hour on foot, more so when the weather turned sour, which it often does in this town called State College. I spoke once with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who told tales of a time when East Halls stood apart, separated by vast swathes of barren land. Now that emptiness is filled, sports fields and grand new edifices rising, the Creamery and a health services building, apartments encircling all. As the campus grows, so too does the struggle of traversing it. What might be the answer to this vexation of movement? On such a ground as this, the bicycle is king. Yet the bike alone is no balm. The students must mount and ride, and the campus must be shaped to meet the needs of those who pedal.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who has taken up cycling again after years of neglect. He mused aloud, puzzled at his own forsaking of it. \"Bicycles are remarkable,\" he said. \"There was a time when it seemed uncouth to ride, yet it's the only way to traverse these distances.\" Beyond the boon to one's own flesh, bicycling is the swiftest means to journey. A bowl of oatmeal, a bit of sweat, and you'll cover miles aplenty. Like many others, I dwell off campus now, as far from its center as some dormitories lie. This year the wisest choice I made was to procure a bicycle. Each day finds me in the Thomas building, a place that by foot is a lengthy march of twenty-five minutes from my dwelling. A bicycle cuts that time to a mere five if I push the pedals with vigor. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas from my abode, is no easy ride. There's merit in walking, sure enough, but time is a luxury I lack. Without my bike, I'd be left with walking as the sole reliable means to reach my classes. To stride to Thomas each day would steal an extra half-hour or more from my time, a toll of over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the minutes spent walking to other classes, to meetings, and so on, and the cost is more than I can afford.",
            "In the land where Aldous Huxley sets his tale, the world has become a place estranged from the sanctity of the individual. A place where the hum of machinery and the relentless drive of the market have forged a new order. Brave New World, he called it, and yet it was anything but. The people there, molded from birth to seek only the fleeting joy of the moment, their souls traded for comfort and convenience. They are but pieces on a board, moved by unseen hands, their lives dictated by the grand design of the World Controller. To peer through the veil with the eyes of Marxist thought is to see the shadows cast by Huxley's suspicions of the rising tides of technology and commerce. The words of Marx echo in the fabric of the story, terms like reification and hegemony serving as signposts pointing to the flaws of an economy still in its infancy during Huxley’s time.\n\nIn this world, capitalism is laid bare, skinned to its bones by the concept of false consciousness. The people, blind to the strings that bind them, care only for their own gain, their understanding of class relations blurred. It is the work of ideological sorcery, the masses conditioned to believe in their own supremacy as long as they toe the line, consume, and adhere to the dictates of the World Controller. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, know not their masters, their wills bent and broken by the whispers of hypnopædia. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet inert, accept their roles, save for the few like Bernard who dare to dream otherwise. Here, the dance of social classes speaks volumes of the perceived chains of capitalism, shackling the soul and spirit alike.\n\nIn this world of Huxley’s creation, true kinship is a ghost long laid to rest. Characters drift through the narrative, ghosts of depth and dimension, as if Huxley suggests that the march of technology and the creed of capitalism rob man of his will and his heart. Love is a relic, emotions dulled to the point of oblivion. Men speak of women as objects, their worth measured by their appearance, the women recounting their encounters with a stark detachment. Each class, snug in its place, mirrors the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering fealty to their role in society mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, convinced of their worth as long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was almost four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC, a time when the room would fill with debates that would rise and fall like the breath of a sleeping beast. The question that burned most was whether Islam bore the face of hostility. That question has not withered with the passage of days but grown more relevant, as if nourished by the events since the shadow of 9/11. I have watched the great machine of mass media shift its gaze from a stance of hostility toward Islam's fervent sons to a tolerance so extreme it perches on the brink of oblivion. In that year of 2001, it seemed that a man with the name Borac Obama, with roots tangled in the rich soil of a Muslim heritage, might never have stood in the light of candidacy for the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as laid bare in his biography, pulls at the threads of intrigue within me. It tells a tale that seems at odds with the man history has long whispered to me. In the echoes of my learning and knowing, I was led to believe that Muhammad pressed his faith upon others like a blacksmith hammering iron into the shape of his will. They spoke of a man who would conquer and claim tribes, bending them to the creed of Islam. Yet, the recounting of his life paints him in hues of a martyr, misunderstood and humble in his dealings. People, it says, came to him, drawn by the 'truth' that shone from his teachings as moths to the flame.\n\nThere are stories woven into this tapestry of his life that bear resemblance to the ministries of Jesus and the wonders that followed in his wake. Chief among them is the tale of mutton and milk multiplied, a bounty feeding forty men. It strikes me as a deliberate echo, a desire to cast Muhammad as a prophet of humility, one who walked in miracles without the need to prove his worth. This troubles me, for it seems a theft of the life and light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to claim that sacred story through the shadow of another.\n\nThe biography is littered with tales, an agenda of witness and conversion, yet many are told from distant voices, echoes of so-and-so who heard from so-and-so. Such accounts, meant to bolster truth, instead unravel into suspicion, casting shadows on their veracity.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the lifting up of Muhammad as a man of godly virtue, humble and wise, gentle in his ways. History, as I have known it, speaks a different tale, one of power and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him today know the true shape of the man who carved their path.",
            "In the time after the passing of the Nazarene, the path of thought that bore his name wandered far from the teachings he once imparted. A man might stand at the river's edge and trace the flow of Christian thought as it drifted from its wellspring, a current unmoored from the life that once was. The world now reflects a burgeoning consciousness, a stir of minds unshackling from the ancient fetters of tradition. Yet, there are those who cling to the teachings instilled within them, their voices a whisper against the gale of change. But these voices may not rise loud enough to steer the course of what is to come. Among the faithful, an understanding will swell, a longing to peel back the layers of time and see the truth of the man whose name they bear. It will be a slow turning, like the grinding of the earth beneath the stars, but turn it will. The tide of history will shift, flowing backward to the time before doctrines encased the light of his words. A movement will arise, each hand pulling away the veils of creed until what remains is the simple vision of what the Nazarene spoke of in the name of the divine.\n\nAs this great reversion sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, men and women will gather to worship not in the ways of kings or popes but as those who walked beside him. The church, an ancient bastion, will guide them still. Yet with this backward journey, the myriad beliefs that once spread like branches will draw together, each branch reaching for the same root. Across the lands, across the divides of belief, the differences will fade and a new sameness will take their place. History tells of reversions such as these. Was not the Roman Empire once the persecutor, now a vessel of faith? Did not this nation rise from the bondage of a people to their ascension in its leadership? In days to come, such a reversion will unfold within the faith, a cleansing of the many in search of the one. It is vital to understand that this path backward will be marked by a reading of his words as parables, not law. And so we ask, what has transpired since those days of the Nazarene?\n\nTo look back, far back, is to find the cradle of faith in the Jewish tradition, the theological forebear of the Christian line. Monotheism, the sacred bond of revelation, the authority of the scriptures of old, these were the pillars upon which the faith stood as the Romans marched into Jerusalem in the year of 63 before the Common Era. Yet, even then, the children of Israel were not of one heart. They were divided, the Sadducees and Pharisees, the Essenes and Zealots, and the many who walked the common paths.",
            "In the pages of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the raw sinews of human nature, exposing the intrinsic greed and self-interest that lurks within. Man toils not for the betterment of all but to elevate himself above the rest, blind to the plight of those beneath him. The sprawling factories stand as monuments to this greed, their owners and overseers caring little for the souls crushed in their relentless pursuit of greatness. These edifices rise against the sky, the chimneys belching smoke that trails to the world's end, a testament to the havoc wrought without heed or care for man or beast. The poison they spill forth and the waste that runs unchecked from the pens of Packingtown are of no concern to those who rule over them.\n\nThese captains of industry, steely-eyed and unyielding, care not for the flesh and blood that swell their coffers. The workers, little more than cogs in a vast machine, are squeezed for every ounce of worth. This cauldron of envy and hatred knows no loyalty, no decency, where a man is naught but a shadow against the gleam of a dollar. They labor under the whip of hours unending, cast aside without notice, left to fend in a world uncaring. Laws to shield them are but dreams, and the managers wield their power unchecked, driving men to the brink in pursuit of progress. The book does not speak it plainly, yet the message resonates—the souls who ground themselves to dust in Packingtown were left to the mercy of their harsh fate, bereft of aid or counsel.\n\nUnions rose like false prophets, promising salvation, yet often they too sought their slice of flesh. The workers, caught in this web, were likened to slaves, shackled to a system as brutal and indifferent as any master of old. Here stood a populace, foreign and lowly, teetering on the edge of want, bound to the caprice of men as ruthless as the slave drivers of yore. In such a world, immorality is not a choice but a certainty, as inevitable as the tides, as pervasive as the shadows cast by the relentless advance of industry.",
            "In the somber expanse of Edgar Allan Poe's poetic endeavors lies \"Dream-Land,\" a work he held in high regard. Within its verses, the word \"Thulé\" appears in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, a term traced by Mabbott to the ancient Virgil. Virgil spoke of Thulé as an island beyond Britain, the fringe of the known world to the Greeks. That Virgil wielded the term is beyond doubt, yet another source casts its shadow upon it, one more modern, yet steeped in the past. Poe, with his gaze ever turned toward the Germanic realms, was drawn to their authors as a moth to flame.\n\nA particular passage illuminates Poe's acquaintance with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe’s \"Politian\" and Goethe’s \"Mignon,\" remarks upon the kinship of their verses, suggesting an echo of Goethe in Poe's own cadence. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, that luminary of letters, whose opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" found daylight in two parts, the first breathing in 1808, the second exhaling in the fateful year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Nestled within the latter part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" It tells of a monarch whose queen's departure leaves him bereft, clinging to a goblet she gifted him. In his grief, he drowns his soul in drink, the specter of his queen ever beside him. At last, he bequeaths his realm to his progeny, save the goblet, casting it into the sea before closing his eyes forever. The king in Goethe's verse and the figure in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stand as shadowed twins, perhaps reflections of Poe's own loss and solace found at the bottle's bottom. A romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842 rendered \"Faust\" anew, mere months before Poe let Thulé slip into \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe spoke of Thulé twice across his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invokes \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing its spectral journey. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" could be read as kin, each echoing the other's lament. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker wanders through a Thulé of shadows, a barren realm haunted by shades of the past, devoid of hue and warmth. These vistas mirror those in Goethe’s \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, bereft of queen and purpose, treads a twilight path. Poe's verse seems to step into Goethe's own, a pilgrimage through shared sorrow.\n\nGoethe's name would have been known to Poe, if not through his own reading, then through the admiration he held for Tennyson, who in turn revered Goethe. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's words betray his respect. But beyond Tennyson lay Goethe's own work, a tide of translations and adaptations flooding the literary world following its initial release. In this tide, Poe surely found himself adrift.",
            "In the land of California where laws are like the shifting sands, a question arises from the commonplace yet portentous act of slipping on applesauce in a grocery store. Could a customer, bruised by such a fall, find in her favor punitive damages when the store's steward acted with malice, having twice been told of the spill and yet left it unattended for the span of a half-hour, his mind more on his supper than on his duty? \n\nThe hand of the judge may not easily sweep away Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To bring forth such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the offending party acted with a willful and conscious neglect of the harm likely to ensue, and that such conduct bore the mark of contemptible disregard. Palmer might argue that Martin, the keeper of the store, should have foreseen the peril of neglecting the spill, for in the months before her misfortune, others had fallen prey to similar slips; yet with this knowledge, he did nothing. While her assertion that Martin’s actions were vile may find less favor, it remains plausible given the record of six such mishaps in that year of 2009, with Martin unmoved to safeguard his domain.\n\nThe thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, brought word to Rich Wayne, a worker of D&D Markets, who told his master, Paul Martin, of the applesauce strewn upon the floor. Martin, wrapped in the trappings of his dinner break, dismissed the warning as he had none other. A quarter hour passed and Mary J. Haddigan, another underling, brought the same news, and again Martin brushed it aside. At half past five, Jennifer Palmer met the floor with a grievous injury. Her fall was the sixth such calamity to mar D&D’s halls in that year alone. She now seeks not just redress for her wounds, but also a reckoning of punitive nature, and the question weighs on whether a motion might bar such a plea.\n\nIn the jurisprudence of California, one may claim punitive recompense for breaches outside the bounds of contract when the wrongdoer is guilty of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So speaks Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, as the law would have it, is marked by intent to harm, or lacking such intent, by conduct “despicable” and wrought with “willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the actor, aware of the likely peril of his ways, willfully ignored the chance to avert it. Such was the wisdom of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the court’s words echoed through the halls of justice.",
            "She had always felt a certain lack, a yearning unquenched, a quiet gnawing at the edge of her being. It began when she was but fourteen, standing on the threshold of a life not yet lived. And still it lingered three years on, at seventeen, an age where the world lay waiting to unfold its mysteries. By then she had come to understand it was not a thing she sought but a someone. Yet no boy had stirred her heart. Some had approached her, stumbling through rituals of courtship with the un-woo-able, but none had kindled the fire within. Often she questioned herself, grappling with the enigma of her own heart, searching for reasons that eluded her grasp. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her musings. So she carried on, her life a tapestry of questions, her desires a riddle unresolved.\n\nA day at home was typically serene, a refuge of calm. Her parents, gentle souls, rarely clashed, their lives a testament to quiet harmony. Arguments with their daughter were rare, a testament to her free spirit and independent nature that occasionally brushed against their tranquil ways. She was the light to their stillness, her vibrant personality a beacon of warmth, her kindness drawing others to her like moths to a flame.\n\nBut today was not such a day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration like a pilgrim seeking grace, the peace was shattered by a scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice cutting through the air like a blade. Panic rising within her, she ran to the source, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, pain written across her face, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her, she offered her strength, her touch a balm. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were labored, pressed from her lips by the weight of her suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove into the unknown.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of antiseptic and dread, but her mind was a singular focus, the world narrowed to the task at hand. She carried her mother inside, her voice rising above the din, calling for aid. Faces turned, concern etched in every line, and hands reached out to help, a rolling bed brought forth to bear her mother away. They took her swiftly, and the daughter was left in the echo of her own worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen, a simple slip from a stepping stool while reaching for a vase perched high in the cabinet, an act of grace turned to folly.",
            "In the vast ledger of human endeavor, a study rose from the depths to speak of a thing called the Mediterranean Diet, a name that might hold a promise of heart's deliverance. In its essence, a covenant of sustenance fashioned from the earth's bounty, wherein an alternate Mediterranean score stood, marking one's fidelity to this way of eating, and with it, a whisper of hope against the scourges of chronic heart disease and the shadow of stroke. A diet born of the old soils and sunlit shores, it bade folk to partake more deeply of the plant's gifts, laying aside the heavier fare of beasts. Fruits and nuts, whole grains and legumes, they sang of life, while the monounsaturated riches of olive and fish kept watch over the heart's chambers. A draught of wine was not spurned, for moderation was its own kind of virtue.\n\nThere had been those who came before, chronicling the Med way's virtue against the toll of life and heart, and they spoke of it as one might speak of a balm more soothing than the low-fat creed. Yet the specter of stroke, its sudden and silent visitation, had not been fully reckoned with.\n\nSo it was that this study journeyed alongside 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, whose lives were woven into the Nurses' Health Study, a great tapestry of 121,700 souls strewn across 11 states. From the year 1984 to 2004, six times did the women recount their dietary ways through food frequency reminiscences, a testament to what they had consumed in the year gone by. Most stayed the course, their stories enduring through the years. These accounts were measured against the truth of medical records and the solemnity of death's certificates, seeking the stark reality of heart and stroke. When records slipped from the grasp of certainty, probability held sway, marking 17% of strokes and 24% of heart attacks as likely but unconfirmed. The weight of their bodies, the smoke of their habits, the aspirin in their veins, and the hormones post-menopause were all tallied, alongside the stride of their leisure's exertions.\n\nTo chisel away the noise of fleeting indulgences and uncover the heart of long-term sustenance, the diet scores were averaged over time, like the slow accretion of silt in a riverbed. Adjustments were made for those factors that might cloud the truth, accounting for age and smoke, body and mind, movement and stillness.\n\nThey wielded the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, separating the wheat from the chaff, to discern the link betwixt a Mediterranean way and the specter of heart and stroke. Separate models for the fatal and the nonfatal, each a different path through the dark wood.\n\nAnd so it was found, in this tale of years, that the women who embraced the Mediterranean ways, those in the highest quintile, faced lesser peril from heart's betrayal and stroke's grasp than those who did not. For in 20 years, 2391 cases of heart's onset, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by the heart's and stroke's hand together were chronicled. The top quintile stood with a relative risk, a measure of their lesser fear, at 0.71.\n\nSuch was the tale writ in the annals of science, a story of bread and breath, of olive and vine, and of the enduring hope for heart's reprieve.",
            "The sign stands in the dust and sun, proclaiming a tale of Hitler alive in Burma. Ellen Page, the actress known for the film Juno, stands solitary at a street's edge, her hands lifting a sign of cardboard, the message thereon scrawled in Sharpie, unsettling and stark. Burma, a land also named Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, governed by a ruthless junta that seized its power in the year nineteen sixty-two, a power born of a coup d'état, and held ever since in iron grip. In the year two thousand and seven, the streets bore witness to protests, the first in a decade's time. Led by monks, saffron-robed and resolute, these protests earned their name, \"The Saffron Revolution.\" And the people gathered, their interest piqued by the monks' call, the government at first begrudgingly allowing such gatherings, peaceable as they were. But peace is a fragile thing, and violence brewed like a storm, the military turning against the monks, monasteries torn asunder. Foreign journalists found their freedom forfeit, imprisoned on sight. Among them, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell, slain for nothing more than bearing witness to the tumult. Official accounts speak of thirteen dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, claimed far more, bodies beyond counting, the toll climbing into the thousands.\n\nSuch is the world's way, the old tale told anew. Atrocities like these are no stranger to the pages of history. The hunger of those in power to stifle dissent, to clutch their rule tight upon the throats of the people, is a tale as ancient as civilization itself. The emperors of Rome, in their marble halls, proclaimed themselves touched by the gods, their power absolute. In Japan, emperors claimed divinity, gods walking among men, guiding them to prosperity, be it through the making of motors or the ritual of hara-kiri. Even now, in the land of the free, George W. Bush, president, speaks each week to Ted Haggard, a voice for foolishness worldwide, a group beneath the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nThe chronicles of history hold many such accounts. The year nineteen eighty-nine saw the protests of June Fourth at Tiananmen Square, where thinkers and laborers and students joined in chorus against the government's iron rule. The numbers of the dead are as uncertain as shadows, from the government's count of a scant few hundred to the Red Cross's claim of thousands. In Rwanda, the nineties bore witness to genocide, the Hutu militias, with government aid, casting a net of death upon the Tutsis, upon any who dared to hold a moderate line, their ethnicity a matter of indifference to the killers. And then, across the years and the lands, Hitler's 'Third Reich' stands as a grim monument, a time and place where Jewish lives were hunted down, extinguished, the world a witness to horror.",
            "In the dim recesses of time and sound, Duke Ellington stands as a figure of enduring grace and vision, his presence in jazz a testament to the long shadow he cast. His hands upon the piano whisper more than they shout, crafting a delicate tapestry where notes hang like stars in the night, each one a testament to his boundless creativity. The orchestra was his canvas, and he painted with the souls of men, drawing out their hidden colors, their secret voices. In the quiet spaces between the notes, you could hear the echoes of something eternal, a music that spoke of the earth and the sky and the spaces in between.\n\nEllington was a master of shaping sound, of bending it to his will, and in his compositions, you could find the space for a man to breathe, to improvise, to find himself in the music. He laid down the bones of the thing and let his players drape it in flesh, each note a heartbeat, each phrase a breath. The orchestra was his choir, and he knew their voices as well as his own, fitting them together like stones in a wall, each one lending its strength to the whole.\n\nIn the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, his name is etched in reverence, a testament to the innovation he brought to the world. Creole Love Call is a song that lives and breathes, a testament to his ability to use the voice as an instrument, weaving it into the fabric of the music until it became one with the whole. In this piece, you hear the echo of a time when music was raw and new, and each note was a step into the unknown.\n\nThe song unfolds in a series of choruses, each one a chapter in a story told without words. The call and response of the first chorus is a conversation between the voice and the reeds, a dialogue that begins in softness and ends in a roughened edge. The muted trumpet of the second chorus speaks in blue notes, a language as old as the earth. The clarinet of the third chorus rises like smoke, the piano a soft heartbeat beneath it. The full band returns in the fourth chorus, echoing the call and response, the brass and reeds in a dance of sound. The fifth chorus climbs to a peak, the reeds in their high register, the brass and rhythm sections a heartbeat beneath. The sixth returns to the beginning, the voice a growl, an instrument in its own right. And in the end, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nHot and Bothered, a year later, is another chapter in this story, a testament to his ear for tone and color. In the call and response between “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, you hear the voice and the instrument as one, a rich tapestry of sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas and stretches them, lets them breathe, the muted trombone of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton a voice in its own right, a melody that dances in the air.\n\nIn Ellington's hands, the music was alive, a living thing that breathed and moved and sang. His legacy is written in the notes that linger in the air, in the echoes that fade into the night, a testament to a man who saw the world in sound and shaped it with his hands.",
            "Why do creatures bend their shapes to the passage of time, twisting and changing as they do? What unseen hands guide the course of their metamorphosis? Though a century has passed since D'Arcy Thompson mused that the zoologist had yet to fathom the simplest of forms with numbers, we stand today only a step beyond his shadow. Yet, there are those who have dared to drape the cloak of mathematics over the slow dance of mollusk bones, tracing their life and lineage in numerical dreams. Our study peers into this enigma, seeking the secret mechanisms behind the evolutionary dance of Prunum, wielding both math and experiment as tools of revelation. We took to the bones of Prunum, captured in their ghostly X-rays, and from these spectral images, we drew the lines of their existence, feeding these measures to the CerioShell. From this sorcery of numbers, we conjured visions of shells that might be, a map of what might lie along the edges of their possible forms. These visions we blend with the raw truth of experiment and observation, grasping for a deeper understanding of the grand play that unfolds in this lineage.\n\nIn the mind's eye, a shell is but a tube bending through the void, each turn a chapter of its silent story. These turns, these whorls, spiral around an invisible spine, the columella, the core of its being. The whorls grow at their own pace, a seam drawing the boundary of each, a suture. The last whorl, the body whorl, is the grand finale, and what came before is the spire, crowned by the apex, the base resting at the opposite end. From the aperture, the creature within reaches out to the world.\n\nA shell reveals itself in many faces: apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The apertural view, the usual face, shows the opening wide, the apex pointing to the heavens.\n\nCounting whorls is a ritual. View the shell from above, find the first suture's birth. With a line, divide the world of the shell, and from this line, count the whorls, each a quarter of the whole.\n\nThink of the shell as a journey of openings across time, as the beast within builds its fortress. We trace this path with the coordinates of the center of each whorl's mouth, charting the course of its growth.\n\nThis path is drawn in lines and numbers. With the formulation in hand, we can play the role of creator, adjusting the threads of the mollusk's bone-making.",
            "In the land of Indonesia, where the sun rises over a tapestry of islands, the cries of newborns and the silence of those who do not survive hold a quiet constancy. For a decade now, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has lingered in the shadows, unmoved by time's passing. The nation strides forward on paths laid by the Millennium Development Goals, reaching toward the waters and the promise of sanitation. Yet, the road to the health of child and mother remains rugged, the milestones unmet, the journey long. Herein lies the tale of a system in need of fortification, not of isolated remedies.\n\nIn the birthing rooms where life begins, there are changes. A skilled hand is now present in seventy-two percent of births, a mark of progress. But the hands of tradition still hold sway, midwives attending without the tools to quell the bleeding that claims mothers in its sorrowful embrace. The numbers tell a tale half-true, a mirage of progress that fades upon closer view. Elsewhere, the scourge of diarrhea in the young is met with fewer healers, the decline marked in the records of the land. Postnatal care, a flickering concern, is scattered and sparse across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife of the cesarean-section, a lifeline in times of peril, finds its place in the world of the city, but in the countryside, it is a stranger, known to only two percent. The chasm between urban and rural yawns wide, a testament to inequity, a tale of access bound to place. The wealth of the land, too, divides the people; the richest step forward while the poorest stand in shadow, a full twenty-seven percent behind, barred by the cost of care.\n\nAs the nation contemplates the path ahead, the question looms large. Shall the focus narrow to the needs of mother and child, or shall the fabric of the whole be strengthened? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their goals clear and their pace swift. Yet, the cost is a shifting of resources, a neglect of the whole for the part, a tale of divided strength. The lessons of the world echo with warnings, the tale of funds for one disease draining the life from another. As programs multiply, they splinter, uncoordinated, a forest of forms and papers where once there was purpose.\n\nThus, the path forward must be chosen with care, for the lives of the young and their mothers rest upon the decision. The tale of health in Indonesia is a tale of many roads, each leading to a future yet unwritten.",
            "The world of Popular Music has stretched and sprawled over the last century, its branches reaching out into so many genres that one is hard-pressed to name them all. Entangled in its own growth, each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk—has birthed its own progeny, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres spiraling within its confines. If one were to argue, Heavy Metal within the rock sphere has become a most diverse and expressive form of popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive for it lays bare the breadth of human emotion, though it often treads the shadowed path of the spectrum. Its diversity came quick on the heels of its inception, as folk realized its pliability and seized upon it to forge their sub-genres, and onward to sub-sub-genres, a chain unbroken to this day.\n\nNow, here we stand amid the heavy metal movement, a landscape so riddled with niches and enclaves that to define heavy metal is a task fraught with uncertainty. It has absorbed themes from beyond its borders, yet it all began somewhere. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the air today, one must first comprehend the very movement of metal, why it is movement and not mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in darkness. It is music born of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It offers less of the primitive, more of the skilled; those who play in metal bands are masters of their craft, and their mastery resonates through their sound. Metal too is, though it may surprise none, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove souls to madness, birthing strange, unearthly records, with drugs as the scapegoat for their creation. It bears many a dark and visceral quality, a novelty in the musical scene where popular tunes often shied from the shadows of the emotional spectrum. Subsequent generations of metal drew from these dark, visceral veins, echoing the Romantic Era's brooding heart. Lyrics such as those penned by Byrne speak to this darkness, foundational to the movement.\n\nThe lines of Helter Skelter reveal the murkier depths of the Beatles. It swings with a rhythm of highs and lows, a reflection, some say, of drug-induced states. This song is heralded by some as among the first of Heavy Metal, a retort to a Rolling Stones track that also treaded heavily and darkly. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle against the Stones, and thus, Helter Skelter found its place on The White Album.",
            "In the time before the surrealists spun their dreams on canvas, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in the world of paint and in the quiet chambers of his heart. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from Rousseau's hand, offers not just the image of a woman bewitched by the landscapes of her slumber but also stands as a testament to Rousseau's own desires and battles. In his pursuit of acclaim and understanding from the world of art that he so longed to join, he grappled with a choice: to mimic the forms and styles beloved by critics or to carve his own path, stark and solitary. The Dream stands as a mirror to this struggle, reflecting his quest for acceptance against a backdrop of independence.\n\nTo gaze upon The Dream with understanding, one must first walk a little in Rousseau's shoes, to know the life from which his art sprang. Born May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a hardware dealer who enjoyed the modest comforts of the bourgeoisie (Shattuck 47). In his youth, art was a stranger to him, for he had no formal schooling in its ways. Instead, he served the state as a gabelou, a toll collector, until he was forty, though he earned the misnomer of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight of their children left him alone save for a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with sorrow (Shattuck 49). It was to painting he turned, seeking solace and a new beginning, untouched by the romantic visions of peasants that his peers often portrayed. He was a folk painter, carrying the dreams and hopes of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the hallowed halls of art is not hard to grasp when seen in the light of his circumstances. He was not only self-taught and late to the canvas but also creating in an era filled with other bright stars. Recognition came slowly, arriving in the shadow of Matisse, who was already making his mark. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon writes of the two as both rivals and contrasts, not just in their art but in the very soul of their painting. Matisse feared the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint in such a way that he might be welcomed into the ranks of the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers would have you believe in some tether betwixt the good and the beautiful. That one cannot be without the other. And so it may be. As Keats penned on that ancient urn, truth and beauty are a single breath. All we know and all we must ever know. Life teaches us much through its harsh lessons and its brief joys. Yet there are things, ethics and aesthetics among them, that we know without knowing how. They are not learned, but felt. A painting or a poem, a moment of grace or kindness. They are not rules to be followed but things to be understood in the marrow. We try to speak of them, to capture them with words, but words fail. They are shadows on the cave wall.\n\nConsider da Vinci's Mona Lisa. You can talk of its lines and its colors, its place in time, but those words fall short of its truth. Ask someone why they love a painting or a poem and they will tell you there is something about it. Something beyond the reach of words. O'Connor knew well the power of story. A story tells what no statement can. It is not a list of attributes but a doorway. Ethics, too, are such a doorway. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond the realm of words, a thing transcendent. It is this transcendence, this ineffable quality, that binds art to morality. They are of the same cloth, woven in the shadows.\n\nWe feel the truth of art and ethics in a place beyond the senses. They touch the soul in ways the mind cannot explain. Literature, above all arts, carries this weight. It bears a moral heart that others may not. Music and painting, they have their beauty, but literature holds a mirror to the soul. It reflects our values, the choices we must make. It is vital because it shows us who we are. What we cherish. What we fear. In its pages, we find the truths we cannot speak but only live.",
            "The Germany of today, a land drawn from the depth of its own history, rises like a colossus from the shadowed alps of München to the northern whispers of Kiel by the Baltic sea. This tapestry of culture stretches from Köln along the Rhine, winding through the heart of the country to Dresden's Saxon embrace on the Elbe. Yet beneath this unity lies a story of disparate tribes and origins converging upon a single narrative.\n\nGermania, the ancient soil of the Germans, bears a name shrouded in the mists of scholarly debate. Tacitus penned the tale of the Tungrians, a tribe once bearing the name of Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish foes, a tale spun in the year 98. It was Julius Caesar who first carved the word “Germanus” into the annals of history in his writings on the Gallic Wars, demarcating the unconquered Germans from the subdued Gauls. The Gauls, it is said, uttered this name first, a label born of neighborly recognition or perhaps the spear they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, the cry of battle echoing through the ages.\n\nTacitus, in his ancient script “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” spoke of the Germans as a people untouched by foreign tides, unmarred by the intermingling of races. He mused on why any soul would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa, even Italy, for Germany's wild lands, its dour skies, unless it was indeed their home.\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. Their ventures into Germania were for trade, for the spoils of land, and sometimes for conquest, but always they returned to the empire's warm embrace. As the first century unfurled, the Germanic tribes emerged at the empire's edge, trading their earth-born wares and pledging their martial prowess to Rome's legions, weaving their fates into the empire's grand tapestry. (Ozment, 2005, p. 17)",
            "In the tale of Twelfth Night, the weave of deception stretches thin across the world like a shadow, and there’s a truth in it that cannot be escaped. That the guise donned for survival might be the very shroud that erases a soul. The danger lies not in the wearing but in the forsaking, for to shed that borrowed skin might leave one standing in a wilderness of solitude. And the choice comes down to the bitter bones of it: to hold onto oneself or to grasp at the threads of connection that fray with the revealing. Faces change like the tides and some may see the trickery with indifferent eyes, yet others will hold it close like a wound, sharp and unforgiving.\n\nThere’s a tangle in the reversal of roles, a question that circles like a hawk. Why does one abandon the self to walk in the skin of another? Viola, the lost wanderer on strange shores, wraps herself in the cloth of manhood, a cloak against the perils that stalk the unknown paths. Her ruse shields her, yet it builds a wall between her and the kinship of women, a gulf that grows with each passing day. She becomes a mirror to the world, reflecting not herself but the desires and confusions of those around her. Olivia, ensnared by the illusion, sees her brother in the face of Cesario and loves what is not there. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) And there too is Orsino, tangled in the net of his own heart, speaking words that bind and unbind. “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nIn the eyes of the now, Twelfth Night reveals the hidden currents beneath the calm waters, the truths that the masks of deception drag to the surface. Olivia and Orsino, each lost in their own reflections, find themselves face to face with the shadows they dared not name. Is it the semblance of manhood that draws Olivia, or is there a deeper truth she cannot see? Perhaps she is but a mirror of the age, a jest of those who see only the surface. For swiftly indeed does Olivia shift her affections to Sebastian, casting aside the illusion of Cesario for the reality of another, finding in Viola not a lover but a sister. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315) And so the play unwinds, revealing the heart of things, the choices made and unmade, in the light of a world that turns on the axis of its own deception.",
            "In the shadowed annals of German dominion, there lies a tale of ruthless governance, one that saw the Ovaherero and Nama people pushed to the brink in the harsh expanse of German South West Africa. Yet to cast the entirety of an empire in so singular a hue is to overlook the variegated tapestry of its rule. The German colonial empire stretched across lands as diverse as its own methods, and within its borders, the matter of education took on many forms. When the British came to claim German East Africa in 1919, they uncovered a landscape peopled by Africans versed in letters and learning. German endeavors in Kamerun and other outposts were likewise acknowledged by the chroniclers of that age.\n\nBut in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the scene was starkly different. There, unlike the eastern lands where state schools sprouted under government auspices, education for the native populace was left to the missionaries, scantily aided by the state. The state, for its part, poured its efforts into the schooling of Europeans, crafting a network of state institutions and heavily backing the schools run by the missionaries. Such policies cast a long shadow over the land, persisting beyond the end of German rule. While other colonies could claim a populace schooled and literate, South West Africa was left wanting, its people largely untouched by the light of education.\n\nThe divergent path of South West Africa was carved by many hands, social, political, and economic forces all at play. This discourse seeks to unravel those threads, casting light on the settlers’ and officials’ perspectives towards the native peoples. A wealth of knowledge lies within the German chronicles of their empire, penned in a time when the empire itself still stood. These early missives sought to delineate the structure of education within the colonies. Later voices, speaking in English, widened the lens, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the particulars of each colony’s approach to education. Among these, Cohen’s examination stands out, a study that juxtaposes the educational landscapes of South West and East Africa, attributing much of the former's peculiarity to its sizeable European settler base.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to its sister colonies, was a land of moderate climes, though much of it lay under the sway of desert winds. It was this perceived gentleness that drew Europeans, their numbers swelling to nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark figure against the 5,336 settlers in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "In the broad expanse of history, there's the tale of two nations, America and Mexico, locked in a struggle that spanned the better part of fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, as set forth by Diehl and Goerts. This tumultuous stretch of time reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848, a conflict where the United States set upon Mexico and came away with the vast lands of Texas and the American Southwest. But the war was but a chapter in a long saga of skirmishes, a tale that only found its quietus in the years before the world was consumed by the First Great War. At the heart of this enmity lay a collision of faith, of culture, of the very bones of tradition, a chasm that yawned wide between the two peoples, as Schmitt recounts. \n\nAnd so it is that borders breed such discord, neighbors turned rivals by the soil they share and the interests they contest. America and Mexico, in their quarrel, are but echoes of many such rivalries etched upon the earth. David M. Pletcher speaks to this truth, noting that the thorn of American diplomacy finds its deepest roots only in Mexico and Cuba, nations pressed close by geography and history alike. Yet while others in the Latin lands have found warmth with America, these two stood apart, wrapped in the cloak of rivalry.\n\nReligion carved its own scar upon the land, a familiar story through the ages. Sally Frahm draws the parallel, likening the American aversion in centuries past to Catholicism and monarchy to a later century's disdain for fascism and communism. Ideologies clashed, not in the realm of governance but in the sanctuary of belief, a mistrust birthed from the enmity of English and Spanish forebears and carried forth by their colonial progeny. Such were the seeds sown in the hearts of nations, a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts recount seventeen disputes that marked the fifty-seven-year tapestry of rivalry, most born of the land, border raids, and the lawless fringes of frontier life. Bandits and outlaws haunted these borders, a specter that lingered until the militaries of both nations laid claim to their domains, as Schmitt describes.\n\nYet time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt tells of a shift, a softening, as Mexico's fate became entwined with that of the United States, the rivalry waning as America's gaze turned from conquest to commerce in the waning days of the nineteenth century. Thus, the story of two nations, bound by history, unfurls across the pages of time.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself shackled by a sickness I had not known, a malady creeping in like some unbidden guest in the night. I had been a nurse then, my hands accustomed to the work, drawn to the trade by the promise of safety, a security that eluded my youth. The words echoed in my mind, a refrain learned in the tender years of growing: \"You'll always find work; folks'll always fall ill.\" So it was that my dreams of science and the pen were set aside, and nursing claimed me.\n\nYet, there I stood, forty-six, unwed, pockets bare, unable to ply my trade. Still now, after a span of fifteen years, I remain ensnared by that which left me, a mendicant upon the mercy of Social Security, all that was once mine now scattered like leaves before the wind. Each day meets me with struggle, an affront to the fragile bastions of safety and esteem. Certainty's light is dim, yet one truth abides steadfast: without kin and a handful of steadfast companions, I would have been lost to the years, my strength a pale shadow against the tempest of disaster.\n\nIn life, there are storms and calms, and no prescience can guard against the tempests too vast for one soul to withstand. It is folly to place faith solely in the faltering machinery of government, worn and weary as it is. Instead, let us turn to one another, to the bonds forged in trust and aid, rather than retreat to the solitude of backyard bunkers.\n\nThe lore of rugged individualism is sung by some, yet it was not alone that our forebears weathered the harshness. It was compassion and respect, the pooling of what scant resources they had, that saw them through. Those who journeyed westward in their wagon trains did not reach the distant shore by solitary endeavor.\n\nPrepare, by all means. I do. A kit against disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheeting with tape to seal against unseen threats. Torches and their batteries, candles aplenty and matches that will not fail, stores of food in tins. If you have the land for it, let it yield its bounty, preserve what you can, and set a stove to warm you. But do not dwell in isolation.\n\nSeek out your neighbors. Know them.",
            "In an age lost to the mists of time, in the shadowed dawn of the fifth or sixth century before the Christ, there was born a prince who would one day cast off the trappings of his birthright, to wander the earth beneath the name of Buddha. Through the long arc of his life, he turned from the world and found enlightenment, and the echoes of his teachings would swell to form the river of Buddhism. The ancient current of it now bears the name Theravada, the oldest stream of those waters. Two thousand five hundred years of time have worn the edges of its doctrine, and what was once is not as it now appears. From the temples of Sri Lanka, the yearly rite of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds, a spectacle of devotion that Buddha himself never spoke of. Yet its absence in the old teachings does not diminish its place among the faithful. The changes, they run deep as they run wide, from the rituals of the surface to the very marrow of the soteriological bones of the faith. Theravada Buddhists, both the robed monks and the layfolk that follow, have bent and swayed under the weight of time, reshaping their beliefs in the face of forces seen and unseen, friend and foe alike.\n\nThere are words and terms that will shape this telling as we step into the shadows cast by these forces. There is the notion of the internal and the external. An internal force, born within the Buddhasasana, speaks with the voice of its own, whether monk or lay disciple. The external force breathes from beyond, a stranger’s breath. Hostile forces, like a storm, seek to rend and break, born of an eye turned cold upon the faith. Yet benign forces walk a different path, indifferent yet leaving their mark as they pass. These words will thread through the tale we tell.\n\nTo begin, we peer into the heart of the faith, the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the sacred text, holds the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka guards the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka unravels the mysteries of being. In these pages, words like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca whisper truths of no soul, suffering, and impermanence. To know them is to end Sansara, the wheel of rebirth that spins eternal. With its halt comes the end of desire, hatred, and delusion when enlightenment smiles upon the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka speaks of conduct, five precepts for the layman: to harm not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not in desire, to cloud not the mind with drink. For the monks, the path is narrower, bound by many more rules. Yet at the heart of it all rests the four noble truths: life is suffering, for suffering is born of attachment, and yet, it can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the world of negotiations, culture looms large and inscrutable, casting shadows both long and deep. It is a thing as much defined by its absence as by its presence, a wraithlike entity neither singular nor fixed. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are obliging is to draw with too broad a brush on a canvas that demands subtlety. The seasoned negotiator knows well that understanding culture's role is paramount, for it colors each word spoken, each gesture made across the table's expanse. One cannot approach a foreign land without the lens of one's own custom, and in that meeting of worlds, comparisons arise as naturally as breath.\n\nTo fathom another's culture is a journey that traverses history and prejudice alike. It is not for the negotiator to judge or amend but to accept it in its manifold complexities, to navigate its currents whether the tide bears him forth with strength or leaves him adrift in open waters. When one finds oneself in the domain of another, respect is the key that unlocks the gate to understanding, smoothing the jagged edges of cultural divide and paving the way to forward progress.\n\nYet do not be deceived into believing that culture wears solely the guise of national identity. Within a single nation, companies cultivate their own peculiar gardens, each with its own rhythm and rules. Some demand the sacrifice of long hours, while others embrace a gentler pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, in the words exchanged, in the very fabric of their being. Philanthropy may be a calling for some, a controlled endeavor for others. Look to the American firms, each a world unto itself, and you will see the diversity of thought that thrives within the larger framework. Where others may seem uniform to the untrained eye, there lies beneath a complexity awaiting discovery.\n\nAnd so it is with values, the bedrock upon which culture stands. They whisper the reasons why, the guiding lights in a negotiator's path. If honor and harmony hold sway, you will not see a man denounce his kin to gain a foothold at the table. Conversely, a negotiator schooled in the art of the deal may bide his time, unhurried by the rush to resolution. The wise man takes heed of these truths before ever he sits to parley. Yet more than this, he seeks to know his adversary as a man, for it is in the personal that the heart of negotiation beats strongest.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. So begins the psalm and with it the discourse of Anselm, saint of old, pondering the existence of that which men call divine. In the shadow of this belief stands another, Thomas Aquinas, a name woven into the annals of theological debate. We are tasked here with weighing the words of these men, to see whose argument might bear the weight of truth. Yet for this endeavor, we presume both voices speak of the same God, the God of scripture, for to wander from this path would leave us adrift in a sea without anchor. In this light, one might suggest neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a foundation whole and unbroken for belief in the divine.\n\nTo start, we turn to Anselm's meditations—a journey inward, a quest for understanding through faith alone. He tells us of God residing within the confines of human understanding, an existence so entrenched in the mind that to imagine otherwise is folly. Anselm's assertion, though couched in words that twist and turn upon themselves, boils down to this: the proof of God lies within the soul. His voice whispers that truth is a thing found not in the world beyond but within the heart, a faith untainted by the need for external validation. The mind, he says, holds the key.\n\nA different tune sings from the lips of Aquinas. Here is a man who sees God through the lens of reason, through the evidence of things seen and touched. Faith, in his eyes, is a crutch unnecessary for the proof of God. His arguments are fivefold, each a pillar of logic: the movement of things, the chain of causation, the necessity of existence, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the world. He speaks of a puzzle missing a piece, and with the rest assembled, one can discern the shape and nature of the absence without beholding it. Aquinas builds his case upon reason alone, a path laid out for the skeptic and the seeker alike.\n\nIn their words, these men lay out their truths. Anselm finds God within, a whisper in the quiet of the soul. Aquinas seeks him without, in the order of the universe. Yet neither, perhaps, captures the whole of it. The question lingers, unanswered, in the space between.",
            "The authors of the world wield their words like artisans, crafting with care the emotions they wish to instill in the hearts of those who read. Some among them are more adept, their techniques more potent. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel The Great Gatsby, is such a craftsman. He fashions feelings and thoughts through the pairing of adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways, casting an aura upon his subjects. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors among them—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. These hues, once laden with significance, serve to remind the reader of emotions tied to objects of import.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns to the colors white and gray a sense of sameness, with white a touch more refined, gray more worn and faded. From the novel’s start, he lays this groundwork. Daisy and Jordan, draped in white—always in white. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's gathering, Tom a white shirt upon meeting Myrtle, Catherine powdered milky white. Only when Nick gathers his impressions of Gatsby’s revelries do the colors shift, halls gaudy with primary hues. Yet in the everyday, white and gray persist: Nick descends the white chasms of New York, names of Gatsby’s attendees now gray upon his timetable, Catherine’s apartment a slice in a long white cake, uniformity defined. The plain and the mundane bear these colors—Jordan and Daisy's shared white girlhood, the gray cars, gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child, gray, the dog-seller, a gray old man.\n\nOnce the colors white and gray hold meaning enough, Fitzgerald wields them to denote insignificance or conformity. It begins with Daisy, her portrayal after a long absence of these colors, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She is less a person, more a uniform piece, something Gatsby covets. More of this technique surrounds her, the gray haze of her fur collar, her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash, all serving to render her a mere addition, uniform and desired.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County, where the earth is generous and the sky ever blue, the land yields a bounty. Tomatoes and citrus and the dark greens of leafy crops rise from the soil alongside squash and broccoli, herbs of every scent, and the tree fruits—peaches and lemons—that hang like bright promises from their branches. Berries bend the bushes, honey seeps from the combs, and peppers lie in wait beneath the leaves. Here, the earth is kind, and it is no wonder that there is hunger for the organic, for food that ties its roots to the land and offers itself in all its purity. In this place, the farmers labor with their hands and their hearts, their names scrawled on long lists, waiting for a chance to share their harvest. Eggs and milk, too, are sought after, each organic farm a small world where the curious might wander, and birds might be watched and the trails might be walked under the sun's watchful gaze.\n\nYet the cost of this purity is great, for organic farming demands much of those who till the earth. It is labor without respite, a battle with weeds and pests fought without the armor of chemicals. The losses are not small, and the fields do not stretch as far as those of the great farms that spread their shadows across the land. To walk this path is to embrace greater costs, to labor beneath the sun with hands stained by the soil. But in the end, the land is richer, the air sweeter for the lack of poisons, and the creatures of the earth find refuge where once there was none.\n\nIn the shadows of Potrero, a small piece of land sits quiet and waiting. It is a part of the untamed world, where chaparral and grassland and oak woodland hold sway, nestled against the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. This land, 160 acres of it, lies under the watchful eye of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, a promise of protection for the fragile lives that dwell there. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the California gnatcatcher—all find their homes here, their futures uncertain.\n\nOnce, this place was home to those who came before, to the Native Americans whose traces linger in the earth, and later, to the settlers who turned the land to their purposes, ranching cattle and cutting wood. This land, an old homestead, holds the memories of those who came before, their lives etched into the soil.\n\nIn seeking to farm this land, I turned to the pages of the internet, to the listings that spoke of possibility. I sought the knowledge of programs that might ease the burden, that might keep the wild alive while allowing the farmer to thrive. In this, I found a model, an organic farm nearby that stands as testament to what might be, where the land is tended with care and the wild things find sanctuary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers as old as the hills and as unyielding as the earth. Within this bond lies a tapestry of emotions spun from the very threads of their shared blood. Love and pride and jealousy and cruelty. They see in each other a mirror, a reflection truer than any other for it is a reflection of themselves. When the hour grows dark and the world bears down upon them, the nature of this bond comes clear. The cost of such clarity is steep, for in understanding these emotions, one must grapple with the shadows they cast. To look upon a brother and see oneself is to reckon with the truth of one's own spirit, unmarred by the illusions spun by others. In the actions taken and the consequences borne, the essence of their character is revealed. Within \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their journey a tempest of emotion. Through a landscape rich and verdant, they tread a road to futility. Pride and disappointment clash in a storm, and only one shall emerge from the other side. The theme unfurls through the flesh of their interactions, the lens of the protagonist's view, as he wrestles with the world and his place within it. A world that shapes his actions as much as his heart.\n\nIt is pride that drives the protagonist, the kindling of his every act. From the first steps they took together to the final path they walked, pride lay heavy upon him. He bore resentment toward Doodle, for in his dreams he imagined a brother to teach of breath held long, of running, of leaping, or climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high branches of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was fragile, his heart a whisper in the chest of a boy who should not have lived. The dreams of the protagonist crumbled like dust, for such feats were beyond Doodle's reach. And in their ruin, he felt a darkness, a shadow of anger that turned his thoughts to violence. Yet even as he contemplated the unthinkable, the innocence of Doodle's smile melted the ice within him. A simple act, yet it bore the weight of hope, revealing that beneath the surface his love for his brother ran deep and true.",
            "The mind of man, a labyrinthine thing, a vessel of shadows and light, weaving the threads of thought into the tapestry of being. As the ages wore on and man's tools grew from stone to steel, so too did the symbols by which we understood this tangled skein evolve. Once it was but a waxen tablet or a papyrus scroll, a book of days unfurling in the light of the sun. Now they reckon it akin to the machines that hum and whir in the heart of the city. Yet one must tread with care, for these likenesses, though they offer a path, may lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning is the touch, the sound, the light. The world is a chorus of signals, and the mind is the conductor, transforming the raw into the refined. The senses gather their tribute, and the brain, with its silent algorithms, molds the clay of perception. It is a process both simple and profound, from the ground to the heavens. The eye beholds a black box upon a field of white, and the mind assembles the pieces: the color, the line, the space between. This is the work of the bottom, the foundation laid stone by stone. But the mind is swift, and the top guides the hand, recognizing the shape beyond the shadow, a box, not a void.\n\nYet the mind is also a keeper, guarding its gates with vigilance. Not all that comes is worthy of its gaze. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, each a whisper in the wind, but only the name spoken in a crowded room pierces the veil of thought. Attention, the sentinel, decides what shall pass, and the mind bends to its will, the dance of perception ever shifting.\n\nMemory is the storehouse of the mind, where the past is kept like treasures in a chest. There are chambers for the fleeting and the forever, each with its own key. First comes the mark, the impression made, be it the shape of a word or the sound of its name. Then the keeper must hold it fast, an echo in the mind's corridors. The scholars speak of signals weaving through neurons, or of proteins shaping the long halls where memories dwell.\n\nThe knowledge held within is a web, a network of meaning spun across the void. Some say it is a map, each thought a point connected by lines unseen. Here is \"chair,\" and there, \"table,\" with \"wooden\" bridging the distance. In the mind's eye, all is linked, a universe of thought, unfolding in silence.\n\nAnd so the mind goes on, a mystery to itself, seeking to know, to understand the world and its own depths, ever reaching, ever searching.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, a shadow fell upon the great expanse of the United States, a shadow born of financial ruin. A time when the earth itself seemed to shudder under the weight of its own sorrow. Unemployment swelled like a dark tide, the houses that once stood proud and sure crumbled into despair, and the mighty edifices of commerce, those towering behemoths, lay scattered in fragments upon the floor of the world. It was a time of reckoning, and the question that rose from the ashes was this: how had it come to pass, and what might save us from its grasp? \n\nIn the heart of the maelstrom lay a tale of folly, a tale of decisions made in dim-lit halls where shadows whispered of gain and glory. The banks and firms, those temples of currency, were goaded into handing out loans to those ill-prepared for such burdens, loans that were like stones cast into a vast and unyielding sea. And in this sea, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of finance, found themselves ensnared, forced to weave these debts into the intricate tapestries of CDOs and CDSs. When the tide turned and the borrowers found themselves adrift, the banks had no harbor of capital to shelter them, and the storm swept through the land, leaving ruin in its wake. \n\nThe tale's beginning lay in the year of 1999, within the era of Clinton, a leader seeking the embrace of his people, yearning for the warmth of another term. And so he loosened the chains upon lending, setting the stage for a tragedy yet to unfold. Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke then with a voice of prophecy, saying, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's hand, urging it to open its coffers to those of lesser means, while the shareholders demanded their fill of profits.\" And Holmes, with the foresight of a sage, warned of the peril that lay ahead: a reckoning akin to that which befell the savings and loans of yore.\n\nThe storm brewed in many corners, its roots entwined with the newfangled mechanisms of finance. Mortgages that shifted with the wind, securities backed by dreams of shelter, and obligations collateralized until the very soul of the economy was tethered to the whims of the housing market. Households, like gamblers at a table, wagered all upon this fragile edifice, leaving themselves exposed to the cruelties of fate. \n\nAnd when the bubble burst, it was as if the very earth had opened beneath them. The financial giants, those masters of the universe, found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of the land bore debts of $4.1 trillion, a sum vast enough to shadow the nation's own bounty. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was unmade, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were reshaped into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in debt, were seized by the hand of the government in September of 2008, their fate now bound to the will of the state. \n\nSo it was, and so it is told. A tale of hubris and hope, of decisions made in the stillness of night that echoed across the years. A tale of the earth and its people, seeking always to find their way back to the light.",
            "In the quiet corners of a story's unfolding, there lies the place where the writer might weave a tapestry of words, a place where the tale could rise or falter. Here, the prose should sing, but often it drowns in its own excess, leaving the reader adrift, lost in the sea of too many words. There's a woman, Dr. Merlin, who knows the curse of this excess well, for she has been heard to rail against her screen when the burden of information grows too heavy to bear.\n\nExposition, that old betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThe wise know the adage well enough: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in those long-winded passages where nothing stirs or too much unfolds all at once. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay bare the past so you might reach the heart of the tale quicker. But beware the other voice, the one that bids you to recount every childhood memory of each soul that walks through your pages.\n\nTo tell is to lay out the past plainly, in prose unadorned. In the flicker of film, it is when one character pours forth a litany of events, much like a mariner of old recounting his tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nPicture this: a tale where a woman meets her love, they wed in splendor, and then he perishes before her eyes. Such a story should not be penned in haste, two pages for a lifetime, with scant words exchanged between them. The pen should linger on the husband, his words and deeds a testament to the depth of his love. Likewise, the heroine should reveal in her every gesture how profoundly he shaped her world. Only then, when his loss is felt keenly, does the reader mourn with her and find themselves bound closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, one expects the flesh upon the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAnd so, as a weaver of words, it falls to you to craft this flesh. There may come a moment when you wish to hasten, to merely sketch the outlines of a character—a man who once flew among the clouds, now grounded as a night manager at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman on weekends, his secret dream to own the station, having supped on Eggs Benedict that morning.\n\nBut the tale deserves more than a passing glance. It calls for the depth that only careful telling can provide.",
            "In the early light of a somber August morn, the news from Columbus, Ohio, unfolded with the disquiet of an unraveling tapestry. The first tale spun out from NBC 4, of a man named Shad Hostettler, whose visage bore the mark of malevolence. He had taken a blade to his wife in Ashley, Ohio, her name lost in the silence of the broadcast. His image, a shadow cast upon the screen, lingered but a moment, as the story was young and details sparse. They said he had stabbed her many times and now lay shackled by the law. Their telling was brief, a flicker of truth in the waking hours.\n\nThen came the news of a boy, Travis Buyers, just eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in Sharon Woods. A bullet had found him, and the emptiness of the street held no answers, no one to blame. The SWAT Team prowled the crime, a funeral march in the dawn. The story slipped by, a whisper in the ether, for Travis was a black boy, his plight swallowed by the void. The world, it seemed, turned its gaze elsewhere. I have seen this before, the neglect of those who wear the skin of night. But if it were a white child taken, the cries would echo through the hills.\n\nFurther along the path of words came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, wings marred by a sniper's shot. A .22 caliber, they said, a phantom bullet in the sky. Crime-Stoppers called for justice, offering riches for the truth. \n\nThe rain too had its moment, the storms poised to break upon the earth come Saturday's end. The heat would cling to the weekend, they said, a prelude to keep eyes on the screen. \n\nA Clime Road UDF had been robbed, a shadow in a hoodie, they claimed, a man of dark skin, tall and lean. Their voices lingered on his color, as though it were a banner unfurled. \n\nAnd there was Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in the halls of justice. A kingpin of drugs from Texas, they said, his empire reaching to Ohio. Twenty-five years behind bars, yet they spoke of 300 months, a curious choice of words. He was Hispanic, they noted, though the tale had no need of it. A detail thrown like dice upon the table, its purpose lost in the telling.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, stands as a curious beast in the realm of securities. It traces the path of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet it moves with the freedom of a stock upon the exchange. Like some mercurial creature, it offers the breadth of an index fund, yet the singular focus of a lone stock, allowing a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to grasp as little as one share in his hand. The allure is undeniable, with expense ratios whispering their lowly song, far beneath those of the usual mutual fund. Yet, like all things in this world, there are shadows cast. Commissions cling to trades involving ETFs, as they do with stocks, a toll paid to the guardians of the market. But the bounty is rich, the variety of funds as vast as the prairie sky. For the astute wanderer of finance, it's wise to test the promised treasures, to see if the riches of diversification truly lie within, and to what extent they shine. In this pursuit, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, measuring it against the ten stalwarts that form its heart, to see if the wealth of a solitary ETF matches the spread of a diverse portfolio of ten, or if there lies a better gathering of stocks, a more bountiful harvest of return.\n\nTo weigh the value of this ETF, we shan't burden ourselves with the entirety of its holdings, choosing instead the top ten, which account for a sturdy 63.58 percent of its assets. Below, the names of these ten and the weight they carry.\n\nIn seeking to understand how these ten stocks mirror the spirit of the ETF IHF, we can use the current percentage of assets, tempered to a full hundred, to reckon each stock's gift to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely made of these ten, aligned as the ETF has drawn them. The numbers, their truths laid bare, follow in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a tale unfolds. A portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent richer than the ETF, a bounty grown by 16 percent. The Beta, that measure of risk, sits .12 lower than that of the ETF entire. Thus far, the path of the ten might promise more gold with less peril. Yet, the specter of uncertainty remains, for it might be that the means of these two collections are not so different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern if these paths truly diverge, we must measure the variance of each of the ten stocks, each brought to the same scale, to compare their gathered variance to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the darkening months of the year, when the world turns inward and the frost seals the earth, there was a notable waning in the entries of the commuter logs, as if the very spirit of the undertaking had been smothered by the bleakness of winter. It was a thing to ponder, the reasons elusive as smoke on the wind. The cold had come, biting, to the New England campus, and it seemed to drive the people from their bicycles and their paths, back to the warmth of their cloistered lives, away from the open air where the breath is visible before the mouth in ghostly plumes. December, too, is a month of reckoning, a time when scholars and educators alike are bound up in the fever of final tasks, their minds a whirl of grades and closing acts. The simple act of recording their transit fell away from them, lost to the shadows of pressing duties. Then comes the holiday tide, the world turned over to celebration and pause, the halls empty themselves of their inhabitants, who are drawn away to their own sanctuaries, far from the tasks of academia.\n\nAnd so, with the coming of the spring semester in January's late days, one might expect a return, a resurgence of purpose. Yet February was a barren month for logs, the emptiness unexplained by reason alone. Perhaps it is the nature of such endeavors, to blaze brightly at inception and then to flicker as the days wear on. To stir the embers, we conjured the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a breath of life into the fading project, and for a time the logs filled again. The challenge then, as we found, was to sustain the fire through the quiet times, through the breaks and the lulls that are the very rhythm of the academic year.\n\nThere is another truth, deep and woven into the fabric of our lives—the allure of the automobile, the freedom it promises. It is a part of us, this independence, and so to draw folk away from their beloved cars, we offered gifts. Certificates for meals and coffee, for books and massages, small tokens to entice. Yet one wonders what might have been, had we offered greater temptations—a bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car. The prizes held steady through our months, and perhaps therein lay a misstep. Had we promised more as the year drew on, the engagement might have swelled. In December, a bicycle perhaps, and in the new year, a car that whispers of a future kinder to the earth. Such dreams might have kept the spark alive.",
            "In the dim chambers of memory, I found myself wandering through the archival corridors of the Library of Congress, seeking out the early Edison films—a collection of trickery captured from 1895 to 1901. These films, fifteen in their number, spun illusions through the deft hand of creative editing. My gaze was drawn to the poetics of these early trick films, noting the evolution that marked the outliers which dared to step beyond the bounds of their time. There was a steadfastness to these trick films, each one confined within its set, framed by the unyielding proscenium, the lens unmoving, capturing long and medium shots, each one a solitary vision. Yet, at the dawn of a new century, a few dared to defy, weaving multiple shots into their fabric. \n\nWhat you see often in these films is a stage, an interior set that holds its ground, the camera fixed as if it were a sentinel. It does not stir to follow the actors who move side to side, tethered to the stage like marionettes. Such was the way of the world then, the celluloid borrowing from the theater, from vaudeville and the art of illusion. The stage, it seems, was a cage, holding the performers from straying towards the camera, from breaching the fourth wall. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the players dance along the horizontal plane, never advancing, never retreating, and the camera holds its watch, unmoving. \n\nThis proscenium composition casts the shots in long takes, seldom granting the intimacy of a medium shot. Close-ups are a stranger in this world, the audience left to witness the performance in its entirety, as if seated in the velvet shadows of a theater. Actors remain distant, middle ground their domain, never venturing closer to the lens that captures them. \n\nIn these early days, each film a solitary shot, a single breath caught on film. These trick films, brief as a flicker, often mere minutes in length, constrained by the ceaseless ticking of frames. Their stories, if they can be called such, are but glimpses of vaudeville—magic acts, vanishing acts, transformations caught in the spotlight. Yet, within this singular shot in the viewer's eye, lies a truth unspoken—a dance of cuts and splices to conjure the apparition, to vanish the seen. Witness The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), and you may discern the seam where the magic is stitched, though to the eye it is as one.",
            "In the realm of the Gothic Novel, there exists a peculiar conundrum, an oxymoron of sorts, the \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt names it in his musings on the genre's rise. This Gothic mode has been both scorned and revered, condemned for its shallow roots and exalted for the terrible sublime it conjures, as Burke might say. The first of its kind, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of the ancient and the modern, birthing a new order of literary expression. Walpole reached back to the old stagecraft and intertwined it with the mimicry of nature that the modern novel embraced, calling it \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre, steeped in echoes of medieval theater and architecture, carried the weight of old traditions. Even in Otranto's time, \"gothic\" was a word bandied about to describe a myriad of peoples, styles, and epochs. It was seen as relic-like, unsophisticated beside the gleaming advancements of modern society and literature. Yet, it is this blend of the old, theatrical Gothic with the new narrative form, offering an intimate glimpse into the psyche of its characters, that allows the Gothic to endure, to be at once obsolete and novel to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmong the tenets of the Gothic is the notion of Chivalry—an idea both preserved and reshaped in Walpole's tale. This medieval code, the making of a knight both brave and just, was a beacon for Gothic scribes, representing an ideal lost to the ages. Walpole, writing amidst political tumult and shadowed by accusations, clung to this vision of chivalric virtue, perhaps sensing its absence in his own world. Within his pages, characters like Frederic embody this ideal, appearing as the paragon of knightly virtue, a prince marked by suffering and tragedy, thought to have fallen to infidels. Here is the gallant and courteous Knight, exaggerated in form, setting the stage for the Gothic's future dalliance with excess.",
            "The world of supply chains is a silent orchestration, a stream of processes that move like a river through the landscape of commerce. From the moment a customer places an order, the journey of goods begins, winding its way through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until it reaches the waiting hands of the consumer. It was in the pale light of 1982 that Keith Oliver, a consultant, gave a name to this intricate dance—supply chain management. He spoke of the planning, the execution, and the oversight that is required to meet the needs of customers swiftly and without falter.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast structure rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools by which managers craft their art, each decision a brushstroke on the canvas of customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins, the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Here, the when and the why, the where and the how, all take shape. Managers look to the market, that ever-shifting sea, to discern the desires of the customer. They read its currents and decide what should be made and how much of it. The place of creation is chosen with care, each plant selected for its ability to meet the demands of volume and quality, with the customer's satisfaction as the guiding star. Workloads are scheduled, machines are readied, and the wheels of production turn. Every detail is a thread in the tapestry, for if any are missed, the cost, in time and money, could be great.\n\nI remember my own time at Wal-Mart and Target, those sprawling empires of retail. Each had its own design, a booklet, a process for every part of the business. A uniform laid out just so, shipments received with a precision that left no room for error. These outlines, these maps, they allowed the company to move smoothly, without the confusion that so often accompanies a lack of direction.\n\nThe next pillar is supply, a realm of strategic decisions that determine the core capabilities of a facility. From these decisions, partnerships grow, some within the company, others outsourced to those beyond its walls. Each division, each piece of equipment, each worker, all are chosen for their fit in this grand design. Sometimes, work is handed to others, a choice made in the name of velocity—the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. It is a decision made in the quiet of a manager's mind, a choice that sends ripples across the surface, unseen but felt.\n\nIn this world of interwoven paths and unseen connections, the supply chain moves ever forward, a testament to the silent artistry of those who guide it.",
            "In the heart of Victorian literature lies an intricate tapestry woven with meticulous detail and an unwavering gaze upon the aristocracy. Yet, among these grand narratives, two novels stand apart, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each straying from the beaten path, weaving mystery and the bizarre into their fabric. This deviation lends a peculiar strength to their characters, unraveling the depths of their motives and baring the raw sinew of their emotions. \n\nThere comes a passage in Oliver Twist where bewilderment and confusion clamber over the mind like shadowy specters. Young Oliver finds himself ensnared between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices lingering in his ears, a dreamlike echo of reality. He speaks to them as if they were there, flesh and bone, until suddenly the crack of gunfire shatters the air. Cries and shouts rise up, a tumult of noise and light, as unseen hands whisk him away. Through this tempest of visions, an unrelenting pain gnaws at him, a torment unending.\n\nThe novel drifts into these dreamscapes, these ethereal realms, to unearth truths buried within Oliver, to peel back the layers of what torments him, and to reveal his understanding of the world’s grim visage. When the gunshot that felled Oliver returns to the fore in chapter 28, it is relived in a vivid, dreamlike state. The experience underscores the powerlessness that grips him, the precarious state of his health reflected in the spectral figures of Sikes and Crackit that haunt his fevered mind. The gunshot overwhelms him, his senses dulled, and yet he feels the unseen hand that carries him, a constant pain now intertwined with fear, not the surprise of a sudden wound. There arises the question of whose hand guides this misfortune, for it is not Oliver’s own. This event fortifies the notion of his helplessness, a boy adrift, unable to seize the reins of fate even as his life hangs by a thread. A creeping despair gnaws at him, as if old Fagin has begun to weave his dark spell, sapping Oliver’s will to fight, bending him to this despair, shackling his spirit. For otherwise, one might think Oliver would strive, if only for the preservation of his own life.\n\nAs one day bleeds into the next, night descends, a cloak of dread. Time stretches and contracts, a silence both endless and fleeting, each hour slipping by like a ghost in the dark.",
            "In the days gone by, I found myself working in a place that was a tether for young minds, a sanctuary in the after hours where children sought knowledge. They came with their books and their questions, and I did my part to guide them through the labyrinth of words and numbers. My realm was English, the art of reading, and it was there that I was summoned to aid a boy named Adrian. His troubles with words were peculiar, a mystery wrapped in the simplicity of childhood. Some letters he conquered with ease, while others eluded him like shadows in the twilight. He was a child of Latino descent, his tongue fluent in the language of this land, yet there was a chasm in his reading that we could not bridge. \n\nIt was not until his mother came that the fog lifted. She spoke only in her native tongue, Spanish, and with my meager grasp of her language, we managed to communicate. And it was then that the truth came to me, simple and profound as any revelation. Adrian did not falter in reading; he merely stumbled upon an alphabet unfamiliar to his home. Whether this realization changed his path, I cannot say. But I hold hope that the boy found his way.\n\nI tell this tale to shed a light on the barriers that rise in the halls of learning, especially here in California. It is a reminder that the obstacle is not always as it seems. Even a child fluent in the spoken word may find reading to be a mountain steep and unyielding. The problem is known to all, yet the solution remains elusive. For Adrian, the answer lay in tutoring, a simple path through the maze of letters and sounds. But for many, the journey is more complex, with no single beacon to guide the way. The truth is woven in the tapestry of dual language systems, immersion, tutors, and ESL classes. None alone can mend the breach; together, they hold the key.\n\nThe dual language system, an idea with promise, not just for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs rise above their peers. Yet fear cloaks this idea, whispers of wasted resources and benefits lost on the many. But this is not the truth. If such programs were the rule, not the exception, all would find gain in their embrace. But how do we traverse this path? Should we demand all teachers to speak in two tongues? Such a notion is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot have those who walk beside the children, guides fluent in both worlds, to aid them on their journey.",
            "From the time we are small, they tell us of a world beyond our own, vast and unfathomable, a realm of mystery where answers are sought in the pews of the faithful or in the silent chambers of the heart. Some of us take with open hands the doctrines handed down by our kin, while others turn away, denying the beyond in favor of a solitary universe where the self reigns supreme. We wander from one creed to another, casting off the old like a snake shedding its skin, always searching for a meaning that fits. We seek not just the light but the shape of ourselves that this light might reveal, a beacon against the encroaching dark.\n\nA cardinal, my father whispered when I asked him which bird sang sweetest to his soul. We sat there on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin above like the slow march of time. Smoke curled upward from our cigarettes, mingling with the damp air. The rainwater coursed down the gutters, drowning the flowers at the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes lost in some distant place, memories flickering like shadows on a cave wall. His frame had withered, clothes hanging loose on his thinning body, hair sparse as the leaves in November. He looked past me, through me, and I felt the chill of solitude, the words lodged in my throat unspoken, for to speak them was to give truth to the fear gnawing at my heart. I drew close, and together we watched the June rain fall, a silent communion.\n\nThe December that followed stole him away, five days beyond the mark of my twenty-second year. The treatments had carved more time from the stone, yet the worth of those days lay heavy with suffering. What kind of God, I wondered, metes out such cruelty? In the stillness of night, I found no solace in prayer, the thought of a listening deity long since abandoned.\n\nI could not bear witness to his crossing from this life to the next. I chose not to. I wished to hold in my heart the father who lived, not the shadow of his leaving. I knew him better than any, better than those who gathered to mark his passing, and knew he would not have wanted his child to see the light fade. Alone, I curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the words that never came.\n\nNo one called. The world turned, indifferent.",
            "In the quiet vastness of fields stretching far and wide lay the heart and mind of John Taylor of Caroline, a man bound to the soil and the creed of Republicanism. His hands, once upon plowshares, turned briefly to the affairs of state, crafting a voice unyielding in its clamor for freedom's breadth and the restraint of government. His was a vision rooted deep in the earth, an agrarian truth shaping his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the laws that govern men.\n\nTaylor saw in the burgeoning land of America a canvas unmarked by the traditions of old, a place where the ideal of self-rule might flourish. He spoke of natural rights, bound inexorably one to another, each fragile as a sparrow's wing, and should one be clipped, the others falter and fall. These rights, he argued, must remain untouched by the hands of governance. In the wild state of nature, strength and cunning reigned supreme, yet in the realm of civilization, such a hierarchy must not stand.\n\nTo forge his vision of society, Taylor called for a governance that acknowledged the light and shadow within each soul. He held steadfast to a morality of duality, proclaiming that as men wielded power, their virtues and vices were but reflections of themselves. Good governance, he claimed, lay in the safeguarding of property, the nurturing of the land, and the tempering of unchecked capitalism. Though all men were driven by self-interest, it was only sin when it transgressed beyond the welfare of the commonweal into realms of exploitation. A righteous government would bind man's darker intents, though it too must be watched lest it stray into wickedness.\n\nIn the manner of the staunch Republicans of his age, Taylor demanded a strict reading of the Constitution, a Federal power constrained by the words therein, no more, no less. For a sprawling Federal reach was costly and prone to tyranny. Yet he knew that mere literalism was fraught with peril, a path to corruption unless the spirit of the framers guided its course. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true covenant, for it spoke plainly of a union of sovereign states, not a single nation.\n\nThus, John Taylor stood, a man of the land, his ideals as wide as the horizon, as enduring as the earth beneath his feet, ever guarding the fragile balance between liberty and authority.",
            "He stood there staring downwards, his mind a blank canvas trying to comprehend the sight before him. Unfeeling, silent, the practiced gaze of one who observes without attaching meaning, his mind dissected the scene laid out before his eyes. Thoughts drifted in and out, faster than they came, seamless and smooth, leaving him to wonder if they were his thoughts at all or merely a stream of consciousness that flowed unbidden through his being.\n\nThere was a time, long ago, when an artist he'd known told him to buy a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He'd sought to learn the art of drawing since he was a child of six, and the book promised to teach everything from the understanding of a pencil to the brain's perception of lines. One lesson it taught was to encase any image within a square frame, turning the chaos of a complex view—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room—into something simple and comprehensible. That bowl of fruit on a plain, uncomplicated plane.\n\nYet now, as he gazed down at the bowl before him, he found no such frame in his mind. Overwhelmed, awed, he could do nothing but stand there, wonderstruck. They spoke of Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of green, the Renaissance masters' spectrum of color. If he fancied himself worthy of the Artistic, then before him lay the genesis of his canvas, the inception of his tale, his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips brushed the tool of his artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind taking form in what might have been the most creative moment of his life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off to oblivion. His muscles tensed again, more swiftly, more anxiously, as his hand struck once more at the lever. But the stubborn brown mass clung to the bowl's bottom like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a foot apart, the green tie uncomfortably tight around his neck, he frowned at the crude parcel of processed animal and plant left as a message for the hapless souls tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand reached for the wall, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "In the dim corridors of the world, young souls find themselves behind the wheel, where the shadows of fate and inexperience converge. The youngest among us, these tender drivers, are caught in a deadly dance, a tapestry of statistics woven with the threads of their youth. The National Institutes of Health speak of this, a tale told by the very architecture of the adolescent mind, unready for the perils that lie in wait on the open road. Inexperience, too, is a silent companion, whispering of rollovers and roads left behind, of speed that outpaces wisdom.\n\nIn the company of their peers, they fare worse still, a truth known by any with a flicker of insight. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation, a grim ledger of age against the tally of accidents. California, among others, seeks to shield them, crafting provisional licenses to bind their hours and bar their young companions. Yet these measures are but fleeting gestures against the storm. The truth of it is stark: these youngest travelers, by any reckoning, are ill-equipped for the burdens they bear.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze further, deeming eighteen too tender an age. USA Today echoes his findings, of a yearning in those beneath nineteen for the thrill of risk, a hunger that outpaces caution. And so, reason whispers of delay, of holding back the keys until the fires of youthful daring cool. Elsewise, we face a future of lives scattered on the asphalt, a toll of loss that threatens to climb, as the children of Baby Boomers come of age, a legion ready to claim the road.\n\nThe path forward is clear and unbarred by complexity. Schools might still teach the ways of the wheel, planting seeds for drivers yet to come. But the road itself would wait for those under eighteen, a privilege postponed. A provisional permit, a precursor to full freedom, could be their guide, with hours of training to temper the journey. The number of these hours might echo the requirements of states like California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nThe specter of youth behind the wheel spans the nation, and so should our response. Uniform laws, national in their reach, could shield our young from coast to coast. In this, there is nothing new, only the quiet wisdom of prevention, a shield raised against the dark.",
            "In the dry and clinical corridors of understanding, this paper walks through the shadowed paths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known to some as CAPD. It first sets forth a definition, brief as the breath of a dying wind. Then it turns to the matter of diagnosis, laying out the common signs, the red flags, as they are known. Lastly, it speaks to the teachers, those guides in the mainstream classrooms, on how they might shepherd a student afflicted with this disorder.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or by another name Auditory Processing Disorder, whispers of the workings of the central nervous system, the brain's dance with sounds. It is the efficiency, the effectiveness, with which this system uses what is heard. Narrowly drawn, (C)AP concerns itself with how the central nervous system perceives auditory information, the neurobiological chorus behind this, and the strange electric potentials that it births. Simply, it is a disorder where the brain, the very seat of our understanding, cannot properly weave the sounds into meaning. Those who carry this burden hear as others do, and thus are not named among the hearing impaired; rather, it is the brain's translation of sound, the separation of words from noise, that falters.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder trace back to the mid-1950s, spoken of then as \"auditory imperception.\" It was a time when researchers turned their gaze to children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian trio, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began crafting tests for such children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, crafting a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system, the CANS, that underlies dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 stirred the waters of research further, drawing attention to children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows itself in manifold ways. Those touched by it may find sound an elusive specter, unable to place it in space. They may struggle to tell apart two or more acoustic events, each sound occurrence a puzzle. Recognizing sound patterns may elude them, and detecting changes in speech, the subtle sarcasm that rides on a change of voice, may pass unheard. One sound might be swallowed by another. They may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues, interpreting them in a way that invites action, and might also be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, one must peer through a lens of systematic observation, watching the listening behaviors and performance on tests of auditory function. A host of voices—those of audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others—use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. This may be done with questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the patient responds to stimuli. Yet, as of now, there is no singular instrument, no test wielded with consistent success, and the cause of the disorder remains a mystery. Many tests present the patient with a cacophony of simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to pick out certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests listen to the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses to these acoustic signals.",
            "In the quiet corridors of my aspirations, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, a calling whispered by the winds of compassion and resolve. My heart beats to the rhythm of service, a cadence of respect and ethics, a melody of commitment not just for others but for the growth of my own soul. These values stand as sentinels in my journey toward aiding the Division of Family and Children Services, where I seek to be a beacon for children lost in the shadows of neglect and a guide for families wandering amidst their own storms.\n\nIn my early days, the direction was uncertain, a landscape of choices veiled in mist. High school and college unfolded, revealing to me a world where many fled from their demons, seeking solace in illusions that offered none. In these moments, I chose psychology, a lens to peer into the human heart. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in that summer of 2009, I found myself at a crossroads, the road ahead obscured until fate intervened.\n\nIt was a day like any other when I met a boy, sixteen and burdened by the weight of his home. He sat on the couch, the air heavy with the silent cries of his spirit. His tale was one of escape from hands that should have nurtured but instead brought harm. The law stood silent, impotent in the face of his cries, and so I stepped forward, my voice a plea for understanding. I spoke to the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses, each thread woven with denial. It was then, amidst the echoes of that encounter, that the path of social work unfurled before me, a road paved with the resolve to untangle such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nJustice, a word often spoken and seldom understood, burns in me like a flame unyielding. Society, in its contradictions, lauds the individual yet molds us in its image. In my defiance, I have colored my hair in hues unnatural, worn garments that spoke my truth, pierced the ears of convention, and stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tides of prejudice. I am an individual, bound not by the chains of tradition but by the call of justice. My journey will continue, a protest against the injustices that stain our world.\n\nAnd so I walk this path, a wanderer with purpose. Each step echoes with the resolve to heal, to guide, to uplift. For in the end, it is not the road we travel but the lives we touch that define us.",
            "In the depths of night, when the world lay shrouded in a quietude so absolute, there stirred a restlessness born not of choice but of the very marrow of one’s being. This paper delves into the realm of insomnia, exploring the paths carved by the Biological and Sociocultural models upon the landscape of this affliction. The Biological model speaks of the whispers of ancestry in the blood, of genetic blueprints passed down, of the corporeal maladies that bind us. In contrast, the Sociocultural model weaves its tale of the world without, of the ties tethered to the air we breathe, the lands we walk, the myriad faces and stories that shape our lives. It is here that we lay bare the findings, dissecting each study, each scrap of knowledge, to better illuminate the models’ truths, their flaws and their merits.\n\nA sleep disorder, a specter that shadows the mind, may arise as a solitary beast, or it may be the handmaiden of other specters, other disorders that dwell within the psyche. These primal sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, they speak of nights where the body rebels, where sleep neither comes nor stays, or where it comes unbidden, like a thief in the night. Dyssomnias, they are sleep's betrayals—Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy with its sudden surrender to the abyss, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the misaligned rhythms of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the vagueness of Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias, they are the dreams that walk the earth—Nightmare Disorder, the terrors, the somnambulist's path, each a tale of sleep entwined with waking. And there are others, linked to the disorders of mind, the Axis I and Axis II maladies, where sleep is but another casualty. This review, it peers into the heart of insomnia, seeking the threads of these models amidst the tangle.\n\nIn the Biological model, the tale is one of the flesh and the blood, of the genes that sing in silent harmony, shaping the night’s repose. Neurons nestled within the hypothalamus, they hold the key, the orexin that orchestrates the dance of sleep and wakefulness. In the laboratory's sterile light, they watched the mice, saw how phenotypic GABAB receptors played their part upon the orexin neurons. The activation of these receptors, by GABAA, a siren song that lulls to sleep. When silenced, anxiety slumbers and sleep takes hold. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, it stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, they whisper of a kinship between the mouse and the human, a shared fate written in the genetic code. The absence or flaw of this receptor, it could spell a lifetime of nights unfulfilled without the balm of medicine. And in the Sociocultural sphere, the implications ripple outward. If this trait be inherited, then it shapes a life, a destiny where sleep is elusive, where the waking hours grow heavy with fatigue, casting shadows over the endeavors of life, the labor and the mundane.\n\nThus is the story told, of insomnia through the lens of these models, a tapestry woven of the threads of biology and the patterns of the world beyond.",
            "In the time since I've taken root here at University Park, near three years now or the span of four and a half semesters, I've come to know the lay of the land, its paths and ways, and found them wanting. For many, myself included, the act of moving from one end of this sprawling campus to the other is fraught with challenges. Back in my freshman days they set me down in an East Halls dormitory, a place so far flung it lay nearly at the eastern edge of the campus, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from Stuart Hall, my abode, to the likes of the Willard building, toward the heart of campus, could stretch nigh to a half hour on foot, more so when the weather turned sour, which it often does in this town called State College. I spoke once with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who told tales of a time when East Halls stood apart, separated by vast swathes of barren land. Now that emptiness is filled, sports fields and grand new edifices rising, the Creamery and a health services building, apartments encircling all. As the campus grows, so too does the struggle of traversing it. What might be the answer to this vexation of movement? On such a ground as this, the bicycle is king. Yet the bike alone is no balm. The students must mount and ride, and the campus must be shaped to meet the needs of those who pedal.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who has taken up cycling again after years of neglect. He mused aloud, puzzled at his own forsaking of it. \"Bicycles are remarkable,\" he said. \"There was a time when it seemed uncouth to ride, yet it's the only way to traverse these distances.\" Beyond the boon to one's own flesh, bicycling is the swiftest means to journey. A bowl of oatmeal, a bit of sweat, and you'll cover miles aplenty. Like many others, I dwell off campus now, as far from its center as some dormitories lie. This year the wisest choice I made was to procure a bicycle. Each day finds me in the Thomas building, a place that by foot is a lengthy march of twenty-five minutes from my dwelling. A bicycle cuts that time to a mere five if I push the pedals with vigor. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas from my abode, is no easy ride. There's merit in walking, sure enough, but time is a luxury I lack. Without my bike, I'd be left with walking as the sole reliable means to reach my classes. To stride to Thomas each day would steal an extra half-hour or more from my time, a toll of over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the minutes spent walking to other classes, to meetings, and so on, and the cost is more than I can afford.",
            "In the land where Aldous Huxley sets his tale, the world has become a place estranged from the sanctity of the individual. A place where the hum of machinery and the relentless drive of the market have forged a new order. Brave New World, he called it, and yet it was anything but. The people there, molded from birth to seek only the fleeting joy of the moment, their souls traded for comfort and convenience. They are but pieces on a board, moved by unseen hands, their lives dictated by the grand design of the World Controller. To peer through the veil with the eyes of Marxist thought is to see the shadows cast by Huxley's suspicions of the rising tides of technology and commerce. The words of Marx echo in the fabric of the story, terms like reification and hegemony serving as signposts pointing to the flaws of an economy still in its infancy during Huxley’s time.\n\nIn this world, capitalism is laid bare, skinned to its bones by the concept of false consciousness. The people, blind to the strings that bind them, care only for their own gain, their understanding of class relations blurred. It is the work of ideological sorcery, the masses conditioned to believe in their own supremacy as long as they toe the line, consume, and adhere to the dictates of the World Controller. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, know not their masters, their wills bent and broken by the whispers of hypnopædia. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet inert, accept their roles, save for the few like Bernard who dare to dream otherwise. Here, the dance of social classes speaks volumes of the perceived chains of capitalism, shackling the soul and spirit alike.\n\nIn this world of Huxley’s creation, true kinship is a ghost long laid to rest. Characters drift through the narrative, ghosts of depth and dimension, as if Huxley suggests that the march of technology and the creed of capitalism rob man of his will and his heart. Love is a relic, emotions dulled to the point of oblivion. Men speak of women as objects, their worth measured by their appearance, the women recounting their encounters with a stark detachment. Each class, snug in its place, mirrors the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering fealty to their role in society mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, convinced of their worth as long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was almost four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC, a time when the room would fill with debates that would rise and fall like the breath of a sleeping beast. The question that burned most was whether Islam bore the face of hostility. That question has not withered with the passage of days but grown more relevant, as if nourished by the events since the shadow of 9/11. I have watched the great machine of mass media shift its gaze from a stance of hostility toward Islam's fervent sons to a tolerance so extreme it perches on the brink of oblivion. In that year of 2001, it seemed that a man with the name Borac Obama, with roots tangled in the rich soil of a Muslim heritage, might never have stood in the light of candidacy for the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as laid bare in his biography, pulls at the threads of intrigue within me. It tells a tale that seems at odds with the man history has long whispered to me. In the echoes of my learning and knowing, I was led to believe that Muhammad pressed his faith upon others like a blacksmith hammering iron into the shape of his will. They spoke of a man who would conquer and claim tribes, bending them to the creed of Islam. Yet, the recounting of his life paints him in hues of a martyr, misunderstood and humble in his dealings. People, it says, came to him, drawn by the 'truth' that shone from his teachings as moths to the flame.\n\nThere are stories woven into this tapestry of his life that bear resemblance to the ministries of Jesus and the wonders that followed in his wake. Chief among them is the tale of mutton and milk multiplied, a bounty feeding forty men. It strikes me as a deliberate echo, a desire to cast Muhammad as a prophet of humility, one who walked in miracles without the need to prove his worth. This troubles me, for it seems a theft of the life and light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to claim that sacred story through the shadow of another.\n\nThe biography is littered with tales, an agenda of witness and conversion, yet many are told from distant voices, echoes of so-and-so who heard from so-and-so. Such accounts, meant to bolster truth, instead unravel into suspicion, casting shadows on their veracity.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the lifting up of Muhammad as a man of godly virtue, humble and wise, gentle in his ways. History, as I have known it, speaks a different tale, one of power and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him today know the true shape of the man who carved their path.",
            "In the time after the passing of the Nazarene, the path of thought that bore his name wandered far from the teachings he once imparted. A man might stand at the river's edge and trace the flow of Christian thought as it drifted from its wellspring, a current unmoored from the life that once was. The world now reflects a burgeoning consciousness, a stir of minds unshackling from the ancient fetters of tradition. Yet, there are those who cling to the teachings instilled within them, their voices a whisper against the gale of change. But these voices may not rise loud enough to steer the course of what is to come. Among the faithful, an understanding will swell, a longing to peel back the layers of time and see the truth of the man whose name they bear. It will be a slow turning, like the grinding of the earth beneath the stars, but turn it will. The tide of history will shift, flowing backward to the time before doctrines encased the light of his words. A movement will arise, each hand pulling away the veils of creed until what remains is the simple vision of what the Nazarene spoke of in the name of the divine.\n\nAs this great reversion sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, men and women will gather to worship not in the ways of kings or popes but as those who walked beside him. The church, an ancient bastion, will guide them still. Yet with this backward journey, the myriad beliefs that once spread like branches will draw together, each branch reaching for the same root. Across the lands, across the divides of belief, the differences will fade and a new sameness will take their place. History tells of reversions such as these. Was not the Roman Empire once the persecutor, now a vessel of faith? Did not this nation rise from the bondage of a people to their ascension in its leadership? In days to come, such a reversion will unfold within the faith, a cleansing of the many in search of the one. It is vital to understand that this path backward will be marked by a reading of his words as parables, not law. And so we ask, what has transpired since those days of the Nazarene?\n\nTo look back, far back, is to find the cradle of faith in the Jewish tradition, the theological forebear of the Christian line. Monotheism, the sacred bond of revelation, the authority of the scriptures of old, these were the pillars upon which the faith stood as the Romans marched into Jerusalem in the year of 63 before the Common Era. Yet, even then, the children of Israel were not of one heart. They were divided, the Sadducees and Pharisees, the Essenes and Zealots, and the many who walked the common paths.",
            "In the pages of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the raw sinews of human nature, exposing the intrinsic greed and self-interest that lurks within. Man toils not for the betterment of all but to elevate himself above the rest, blind to the plight of those beneath him. The sprawling factories stand as monuments to this greed, their owners and overseers caring little for the souls crushed in their relentless pursuit of greatness. These edifices rise against the sky, the chimneys belching smoke that trails to the world's end, a testament to the havoc wrought without heed or care for man or beast. The poison they spill forth and the waste that runs unchecked from the pens of Packingtown are of no concern to those who rule over them.\n\nThese captains of industry, steely-eyed and unyielding, care not for the flesh and blood that swell their coffers. The workers, little more than cogs in a vast machine, are squeezed for every ounce of worth. This cauldron of envy and hatred knows no loyalty, no decency, where a man is naught but a shadow against the gleam of a dollar. They labor under the whip of hours unending, cast aside without notice, left to fend in a world uncaring. Laws to shield them are but dreams, and the managers wield their power unchecked, driving men to the brink in pursuit of progress. The book does not speak it plainly, yet the message resonates—the souls who ground themselves to dust in Packingtown were left to the mercy of their harsh fate, bereft of aid or counsel.\n\nUnions rose like false prophets, promising salvation, yet often they too sought their slice of flesh. The workers, caught in this web, were likened to slaves, shackled to a system as brutal and indifferent as any master of old. Here stood a populace, foreign and lowly, teetering on the edge of want, bound to the caprice of men as ruthless as the slave drivers of yore. In such a world, immorality is not a choice but a certainty, as inevitable as the tides, as pervasive as the shadows cast by the relentless advance of industry.",
            "In the somber expanse of Edgar Allan Poe's poetic endeavors lies \"Dream-Land,\" a work he held in high regard. Within its verses, the word \"Thulé\" appears in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, a term traced by Mabbott to the ancient Virgil. Virgil spoke of Thulé as an island beyond Britain, the fringe of the known world to the Greeks. That Virgil wielded the term is beyond doubt, yet another source casts its shadow upon it, one more modern, yet steeped in the past. Poe, with his gaze ever turned toward the Germanic realms, was drawn to their authors as a moth to flame.\n\nA particular passage illuminates Poe's acquaintance with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe’s \"Politian\" and Goethe’s \"Mignon,\" remarks upon the kinship of their verses, suggesting an echo of Goethe in Poe's own cadence. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, that luminary of letters, whose opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" found daylight in two parts, the first breathing in 1808, the second exhaling in the fateful year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Nestled within the latter part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" It tells of a monarch whose queen's departure leaves him bereft, clinging to a goblet she gifted him. In his grief, he drowns his soul in drink, the specter of his queen ever beside him. At last, he bequeaths his realm to his progeny, save the goblet, casting it into the sea before closing his eyes forever. The king in Goethe's verse and the figure in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stand as shadowed twins, perhaps reflections of Poe's own loss and solace found at the bottle's bottom. A romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842 rendered \"Faust\" anew, mere months before Poe let Thulé slip into \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe spoke of Thulé twice across his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invokes \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing its spectral journey. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" could be read as kin, each echoing the other's lament. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker wanders through a Thulé of shadows, a barren realm haunted by shades of the past, devoid of hue and warmth. These vistas mirror those in Goethe’s \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, bereft of queen and purpose, treads a twilight path. Poe's verse seems to step into Goethe's own, a pilgrimage through shared sorrow.\n\nGoethe's name would have been known to Poe, if not through his own reading, then through the admiration he held for Tennyson, who in turn revered Goethe. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's words betray his respect. But beyond Tennyson lay Goethe's own work, a tide of translations and adaptations flooding the literary world following its initial release. In this tide, Poe surely found himself adrift.",
            "In the land of California where laws are like the shifting sands, a question arises from the commonplace yet portentous act of slipping on applesauce in a grocery store. Could a customer, bruised by such a fall, find in her favor punitive damages when the store's steward acted with malice, having twice been told of the spill and yet left it unattended for the span of a half-hour, his mind more on his supper than on his duty? \n\nThe hand of the judge may not easily sweep away Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To bring forth such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the offending party acted with a willful and conscious neglect of the harm likely to ensue, and that such conduct bore the mark of contemptible disregard. Palmer might argue that Martin, the keeper of the store, should have foreseen the peril of neglecting the spill, for in the months before her misfortune, others had fallen prey to similar slips; yet with this knowledge, he did nothing. While her assertion that Martin’s actions were vile may find less favor, it remains plausible given the record of six such mishaps in that year of 2009, with Martin unmoved to safeguard his domain.\n\nThe thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, brought word to Rich Wayne, a worker of D&D Markets, who told his master, Paul Martin, of the applesauce strewn upon the floor. Martin, wrapped in the trappings of his dinner break, dismissed the warning as he had none other. A quarter hour passed and Mary J. Haddigan, another underling, brought the same news, and again Martin brushed it aside. At half past five, Jennifer Palmer met the floor with a grievous injury. Her fall was the sixth such calamity to mar D&D’s halls in that year alone. She now seeks not just redress for her wounds, but also a reckoning of punitive nature, and the question weighs on whether a motion might bar such a plea.\n\nIn the jurisprudence of California, one may claim punitive recompense for breaches outside the bounds of contract when the wrongdoer is guilty of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So speaks Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, as the law would have it, is marked by intent to harm, or lacking such intent, by conduct “despicable” and wrought with “willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the actor, aware of the likely peril of his ways, willfully ignored the chance to avert it. Such was the wisdom of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the court’s words echoed through the halls of justice.",
            "She had always felt a certain lack, a yearning unquenched, a quiet gnawing at the edge of her being. It began when she was but fourteen, standing on the threshold of a life not yet lived. And still it lingered three years on, at seventeen, an age where the world lay waiting to unfold its mysteries. By then she had come to understand it was not a thing she sought but a someone. Yet no boy had stirred her heart. Some had approached her, stumbling through rituals of courtship with the un-woo-able, but none had kindled the fire within. Often she questioned herself, grappling with the enigma of her own heart, searching for reasons that eluded her grasp. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her musings. So she carried on, her life a tapestry of questions, her desires a riddle unresolved.\n\nA day at home was typically serene, a refuge of calm. Her parents, gentle souls, rarely clashed, their lives a testament to quiet harmony. Arguments with their daughter were rare, a testament to her free spirit and independent nature that occasionally brushed against their tranquil ways. She was the light to their stillness, her vibrant personality a beacon of warmth, her kindness drawing others to her like moths to a flame.\n\nBut today was not such a day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration like a pilgrim seeking grace, the peace was shattered by a scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice cutting through the air like a blade. Panic rising within her, she ran to the source, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, pain written across her face, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her, she offered her strength, her touch a balm. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were labored, pressed from her lips by the weight of her suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove into the unknown.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of antiseptic and dread, but her mind was a singular focus, the world narrowed to the task at hand. She carried her mother inside, her voice rising above the din, calling for aid. Faces turned, concern etched in every line, and hands reached out to help, a rolling bed brought forth to bear her mother away. They took her swiftly, and the daughter was left in the echo of her own worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen, a simple slip from a stepping stool while reaching for a vase perched high in the cabinet, an act of grace turned to folly.",
            "In the vast ledger of human endeavor, a study rose from the depths to speak of a thing called the Mediterranean Diet, a name that might hold a promise of heart's deliverance. In its essence, a covenant of sustenance fashioned from the earth's bounty, wherein an alternate Mediterranean score stood, marking one's fidelity to this way of eating, and with it, a whisper of hope against the scourges of chronic heart disease and the shadow of stroke. A diet born of the old soils and sunlit shores, it bade folk to partake more deeply of the plant's gifts, laying aside the heavier fare of beasts. Fruits and nuts, whole grains and legumes, they sang of life, while the monounsaturated riches of olive and fish kept watch over the heart's chambers. A draught of wine was not spurned, for moderation was its own kind of virtue.\n\nThere had been those who came before, chronicling the Med way's virtue against the toll of life and heart, and they spoke of it as one might speak of a balm more soothing than the low-fat creed. Yet the specter of stroke, its sudden and silent visitation, had not been fully reckoned with.\n\nSo it was that this study journeyed alongside 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, whose lives were woven into the Nurses' Health Study, a great tapestry of 121,700 souls strewn across 11 states. From the year 1984 to 2004, six times did the women recount their dietary ways through food frequency reminiscences, a testament to what they had consumed in the year gone by. Most stayed the course, their stories enduring through the years. These accounts were measured against the truth of medical records and the solemnity of death's certificates, seeking the stark reality of heart and stroke. When records slipped from the grasp of certainty, probability held sway, marking 17% of strokes and 24% of heart attacks as likely but unconfirmed. The weight of their bodies, the smoke of their habits, the aspirin in their veins, and the hormones post-menopause were all tallied, alongside the stride of their leisure's exertions.\n\nTo chisel away the noise of fleeting indulgences and uncover the heart of long-term sustenance, the diet scores were averaged over time, like the slow accretion of silt in a riverbed. Adjustments were made for those factors that might cloud the truth, accounting for age and smoke, body and mind, movement and stillness.\n\nThey wielded the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, separating the wheat from the chaff, to discern the link betwixt a Mediterranean way and the specter of heart and stroke. Separate models for the fatal and the nonfatal, each a different path through the dark wood.\n\nAnd so it was found, in this tale of years, that the women who embraced the Mediterranean ways, those in the highest quintile, faced lesser peril from heart's betrayal and stroke's grasp than those who did not. For in 20 years, 2391 cases of heart's onset, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by the heart's and stroke's hand together were chronicled. The top quintile stood with a relative risk, a measure of their lesser fear, at 0.71.\n\nSuch was the tale writ in the annals of science, a story of bread and breath, of olive and vine, and of the enduring hope for heart's reprieve.",
            "The sign stands in the dust and sun, proclaiming a tale of Hitler alive in Burma. Ellen Page, the actress known for the film Juno, stands solitary at a street's edge, her hands lifting a sign of cardboard, the message thereon scrawled in Sharpie, unsettling and stark. Burma, a land also named Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, governed by a ruthless junta that seized its power in the year nineteen sixty-two, a power born of a coup d'état, and held ever since in iron grip. In the year two thousand and seven, the streets bore witness to protests, the first in a decade's time. Led by monks, saffron-robed and resolute, these protests earned their name, \"The Saffron Revolution.\" And the people gathered, their interest piqued by the monks' call, the government at first begrudgingly allowing such gatherings, peaceable as they were. But peace is a fragile thing, and violence brewed like a storm, the military turning against the monks, monasteries torn asunder. Foreign journalists found their freedom forfeit, imprisoned on sight. Among them, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell, slain for nothing more than bearing witness to the tumult. Official accounts speak of thirteen dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, claimed far more, bodies beyond counting, the toll climbing into the thousands.\n\nSuch is the world's way, the old tale told anew. Atrocities like these are no stranger to the pages of history. The hunger of those in power to stifle dissent, to clutch their rule tight upon the throats of the people, is a tale as ancient as civilization itself. The emperors of Rome, in their marble halls, proclaimed themselves touched by the gods, their power absolute. In Japan, emperors claimed divinity, gods walking among men, guiding them to prosperity, be it through the making of motors or the ritual of hara-kiri. Even now, in the land of the free, George W. Bush, president, speaks each week to Ted Haggard, a voice for foolishness worldwide, a group beneath the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nThe chronicles of history hold many such accounts. The year nineteen eighty-nine saw the protests of June Fourth at Tiananmen Square, where thinkers and laborers and students joined in chorus against the government's iron rule. The numbers of the dead are as uncertain as shadows, from the government's count of a scant few hundred to the Red Cross's claim of thousands. In Rwanda, the nineties bore witness to genocide, the Hutu militias, with government aid, casting a net of death upon the Tutsis, upon any who dared to hold a moderate line, their ethnicity a matter of indifference to the killers. And then, across the years and the lands, Hitler's 'Third Reich' stands as a grim monument, a time and place where Jewish lives were hunted down, extinguished, the world a witness to horror.",
            "In the dim recesses of time and sound, Duke Ellington stands as a figure of enduring grace and vision, his presence in jazz a testament to the long shadow he cast. His hands upon the piano whisper more than they shout, crafting a delicate tapestry where notes hang like stars in the night, each one a testament to his boundless creativity. The orchestra was his canvas, and he painted with the souls of men, drawing out their hidden colors, their secret voices. In the quiet spaces between the notes, you could hear the echoes of something eternal, a music that spoke of the earth and the sky and the spaces in between.\n\nEllington was a master of shaping sound, of bending it to his will, and in his compositions, you could find the space for a man to breathe, to improvise, to find himself in the music. He laid down the bones of the thing and let his players drape it in flesh, each note a heartbeat, each phrase a breath. The orchestra was his choir, and he knew their voices as well as his own, fitting them together like stones in a wall, each one lending its strength to the whole.\n\nIn the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, his name is etched in reverence, a testament to the innovation he brought to the world. Creole Love Call is a song that lives and breathes, a testament to his ability to use the voice as an instrument, weaving it into the fabric of the music until it became one with the whole. In this piece, you hear the echo of a time when music was raw and new, and each note was a step into the unknown.\n\nThe song unfolds in a series of choruses, each one a chapter in a story told without words. The call and response of the first chorus is a conversation between the voice and the reeds, a dialogue that begins in softness and ends in a roughened edge. The muted trumpet of the second chorus speaks in blue notes, a language as old as the earth. The clarinet of the third chorus rises like smoke, the piano a soft heartbeat beneath it. The full band returns in the fourth chorus, echoing the call and response, the brass and reeds in a dance of sound. The fifth chorus climbs to a peak, the reeds in their high register, the brass and rhythm sections a heartbeat beneath. The sixth returns to the beginning, the voice a growl, an instrument in its own right. And in the end, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nHot and Bothered, a year later, is another chapter in this story, a testament to his ear for tone and color. In the call and response between “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, you hear the voice and the instrument as one, a rich tapestry of sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas and stretches them, lets them breathe, the muted trombone of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton a voice in its own right, a melody that dances in the air.\n\nIn Ellington's hands, the music was alive, a living thing that breathed and moved and sang. His legacy is written in the notes that linger in the air, in the echoes that fade into the night, a testament to a man who saw the world in sound and shaped it with his hands.",
            "Why do creatures bend their shapes to the passage of time, twisting and changing as they do? What unseen hands guide the course of their metamorphosis? Though a century has passed since D'Arcy Thompson mused that the zoologist had yet to fathom the simplest of forms with numbers, we stand today only a step beyond his shadow. Yet, there are those who have dared to drape the cloak of mathematics over the slow dance of mollusk bones, tracing their life and lineage in numerical dreams. Our study peers into this enigma, seeking the secret mechanisms behind the evolutionary dance of Prunum, wielding both math and experiment as tools of revelation. We took to the bones of Prunum, captured in their ghostly X-rays, and from these spectral images, we drew the lines of their existence, feeding these measures to the CerioShell. From this sorcery of numbers, we conjured visions of shells that might be, a map of what might lie along the edges of their possible forms. These visions we blend with the raw truth of experiment and observation, grasping for a deeper understanding of the grand play that unfolds in this lineage.\n\nIn the mind's eye, a shell is but a tube bending through the void, each turn a chapter of its silent story. These turns, these whorls, spiral around an invisible spine, the columella, the core of its being. The whorls grow at their own pace, a seam drawing the boundary of each, a suture. The last whorl, the body whorl, is the grand finale, and what came before is the spire, crowned by the apex, the base resting at the opposite end. From the aperture, the creature within reaches out to the world.\n\nA shell reveals itself in many faces: apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The apertural view, the usual face, shows the opening wide, the apex pointing to the heavens.\n\nCounting whorls is a ritual. View the shell from above, find the first suture's birth. With a line, divide the world of the shell, and from this line, count the whorls, each a quarter of the whole.\n\nThink of the shell as a journey of openings across time, as the beast within builds its fortress. We trace this path with the coordinates of the center of each whorl's mouth, charting the course of its growth.\n\nThis path is drawn in lines and numbers. With the formulation in hand, we can play the role of creator, adjusting the threads of the mollusk's bone-making.",
            "In the land of Indonesia, where the sun rises over a tapestry of islands, the cries of newborns and the silence of those who do not survive hold a quiet constancy. For a decade now, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has lingered in the shadows, unmoved by time's passing. The nation strides forward on paths laid by the Millennium Development Goals, reaching toward the waters and the promise of sanitation. Yet, the road to the health of child and mother remains rugged, the milestones unmet, the journey long. Herein lies the tale of a system in need of fortification, not of isolated remedies.\n\nIn the birthing rooms where life begins, there are changes. A skilled hand is now present in seventy-two percent of births, a mark of progress. But the hands of tradition still hold sway, midwives attending without the tools to quell the bleeding that claims mothers in its sorrowful embrace. The numbers tell a tale half-true, a mirage of progress that fades upon closer view. Elsewhere, the scourge of diarrhea in the young is met with fewer healers, the decline marked in the records of the land. Postnatal care, a flickering concern, is scattered and sparse across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife of the cesarean-section, a lifeline in times of peril, finds its place in the world of the city, but in the countryside, it is a stranger, known to only two percent. The chasm between urban and rural yawns wide, a testament to inequity, a tale of access bound to place. The wealth of the land, too, divides the people; the richest step forward while the poorest stand in shadow, a full twenty-seven percent behind, barred by the cost of care.\n\nAs the nation contemplates the path ahead, the question looms large. Shall the focus narrow to the needs of mother and child, or shall the fabric of the whole be strengthened? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their goals clear and their pace swift. Yet, the cost is a shifting of resources, a neglect of the whole for the part, a tale of divided strength. The lessons of the world echo with warnings, the tale of funds for one disease draining the life from another. As programs multiply, they splinter, uncoordinated, a forest of forms and papers where once there was purpose.\n\nThus, the path forward must be chosen with care, for the lives of the young and their mothers rest upon the decision. The tale of health in Indonesia is a tale of many roads, each leading to a future yet unwritten.",
            "The world of Popular Music has stretched and sprawled over the last century, its branches reaching out into so many genres that one is hard-pressed to name them all. Entangled in its own growth, each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk—has birthed its own progeny, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres spiraling within its confines. If one were to argue, Heavy Metal within the rock sphere has become a most diverse and expressive form of popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive for it lays bare the breadth of human emotion, though it often treads the shadowed path of the spectrum. Its diversity came quick on the heels of its inception, as folk realized its pliability and seized upon it to forge their sub-genres, and onward to sub-sub-genres, a chain unbroken to this day.\n\nNow, here we stand amid the heavy metal movement, a landscape so riddled with niches and enclaves that to define heavy metal is a task fraught with uncertainty. It has absorbed themes from beyond its borders, yet it all began somewhere. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the air today, one must first comprehend the very movement of metal, why it is movement and not mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in darkness. It is music born of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It offers less of the primitive, more of the skilled; those who play in metal bands are masters of their craft, and their mastery resonates through their sound. Metal too is, though it may surprise none, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove souls to madness, birthing strange, unearthly records, with drugs as the scapegoat for their creation. It bears many a dark and visceral quality, a novelty in the musical scene where popular tunes often shied from the shadows of the emotional spectrum. Subsequent generations of metal drew from these dark, visceral veins, echoing the Romantic Era's brooding heart. Lyrics such as those penned by Byrne speak to this darkness, foundational to the movement.\n\nThe lines of Helter Skelter reveal the murkier depths of the Beatles. It swings with a rhythm of highs and lows, a reflection, some say, of drug-induced states. This song is heralded by some as among the first of Heavy Metal, a retort to a Rolling Stones track that also treaded heavily and darkly. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle against the Stones, and thus, Helter Skelter found its place on The White Album.",
            "In the time before the surrealists spun their dreams on canvas, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in the world of paint and in the quiet chambers of his heart. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from Rousseau's hand, offers not just the image of a woman bewitched by the landscapes of her slumber but also stands as a testament to Rousseau's own desires and battles. In his pursuit of acclaim and understanding from the world of art that he so longed to join, he grappled with a choice: to mimic the forms and styles beloved by critics or to carve his own path, stark and solitary. The Dream stands as a mirror to this struggle, reflecting his quest for acceptance against a backdrop of independence.\n\nTo gaze upon The Dream with understanding, one must first walk a little in Rousseau's shoes, to know the life from which his art sprang. Born May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a hardware dealer who enjoyed the modest comforts of the bourgeoisie (Shattuck 47). In his youth, art was a stranger to him, for he had no formal schooling in its ways. Instead, he served the state as a gabelou, a toll collector, until he was forty, though he earned the misnomer of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight of their children left him alone save for a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with sorrow (Shattuck 49). It was to painting he turned, seeking solace and a new beginning, untouched by the romantic visions of peasants that his peers often portrayed. He was a folk painter, carrying the dreams and hopes of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the hallowed halls of art is not hard to grasp when seen in the light of his circumstances. He was not only self-taught and late to the canvas but also creating in an era filled with other bright stars. Recognition came slowly, arriving in the shadow of Matisse, who was already making his mark. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon writes of the two as both rivals and contrasts, not just in their art but in the very soul of their painting. Matisse feared the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint in such a way that he might be welcomed into the ranks of the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers would have you believe in some tether betwixt the good and the beautiful. That one cannot be without the other. And so it may be. As Keats penned on that ancient urn, truth and beauty are a single breath. All we know and all we must ever know. Life teaches us much through its harsh lessons and its brief joys. Yet there are things, ethics and aesthetics among them, that we know without knowing how. They are not learned, but felt. A painting or a poem, a moment of grace or kindness. They are not rules to be followed but things to be understood in the marrow. We try to speak of them, to capture them with words, but words fail. They are shadows on the cave wall.\n\nConsider da Vinci's Mona Lisa. You can talk of its lines and its colors, its place in time, but those words fall short of its truth. Ask someone why they love a painting or a poem and they will tell you there is something about it. Something beyond the reach of words. O'Connor knew well the power of story. A story tells what no statement can. It is not a list of attributes but a doorway. Ethics, too, are such a doorway. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond the realm of words, a thing transcendent. It is this transcendence, this ineffable quality, that binds art to morality. They are of the same cloth, woven in the shadows.\n\nWe feel the truth of art and ethics in a place beyond the senses. They touch the soul in ways the mind cannot explain. Literature, above all arts, carries this weight. It bears a moral heart that others may not. Music and painting, they have their beauty, but literature holds a mirror to the soul. It reflects our values, the choices we must make. It is vital because it shows us who we are. What we cherish. What we fear. In its pages, we find the truths we cannot speak but only live.",
            "The Germany of today, a land drawn from the depth of its own history, rises like a colossus from the shadowed alps of München to the northern whispers of Kiel by the Baltic sea. This tapestry of culture stretches from Köln along the Rhine, winding through the heart of the country to Dresden's Saxon embrace on the Elbe. Yet beneath this unity lies a story of disparate tribes and origins converging upon a single narrative.\n\nGermania, the ancient soil of the Germans, bears a name shrouded in the mists of scholarly debate. Tacitus penned the tale of the Tungrians, a tribe once bearing the name of Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish foes, a tale spun in the year 98. It was Julius Caesar who first carved the word “Germanus” into the annals of history in his writings on the Gallic Wars, demarcating the unconquered Germans from the subdued Gauls. The Gauls, it is said, uttered this name first, a label born of neighborly recognition or perhaps the spear they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, the cry of battle echoing through the ages.\n\nTacitus, in his ancient script “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” spoke of the Germans as a people untouched by foreign tides, unmarred by the intermingling of races. He mused on why any soul would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa, even Italy, for Germany's wild lands, its dour skies, unless it was indeed their home.\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. Their ventures into Germania were for trade, for the spoils of land, and sometimes for conquest, but always they returned to the empire's warm embrace. As the first century unfurled, the Germanic tribes emerged at the empire's edge, trading their earth-born wares and pledging their martial prowess to Rome's legions, weaving their fates into the empire's grand tapestry.

            "In the tale of Twelfth Night, the weave of deception stretches thin across the world like a shadow, and there’s a truth in it that cannot be escaped. That the guise donned for survival might be the very shroud that erases a soul. The danger lies not in the wearing but in the forsaking, for to shed that borrowed skin might leave one standing in a wilderness of solitude. And the choice comes down to the bitter bones of it: to hold onto oneself or to grasp at the threads of connection that fray with the revealing. Faces change like the tides and some may see the trickery with indifferent eyes, yet others will hold it close like a wound, sharp and unforgiving.\n\nThere’s a tangle in the reversal of roles, a question that circles like a hawk. Why does one abandon the self to walk in the skin of another? Viola, the lost wanderer on strange shores, wraps herself in the cloth of manhood, a cloak against the perils that stalk the unknown paths. Her ruse shields her, yet it builds a wall between her and the kinship of women, a gulf that grows with each passing day. She becomes a mirror to the world, reflecting not herself but the desires and confusions of those around her. Olivia, ensnared by the illusion, sees her brother in the face of Cesario and loves what is not there. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) And there too is Orsino, tangled in the net of his own heart, speaking words that bind and unbind. “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nIn the eyes of the now, Twelfth Night reveals the hidden currents beneath the calm waters, the truths that the masks of deception drag to the surface. Olivia and Orsino, each lost in their own reflections, find themselves face to face with the shadows they dared not name. Is it the semblance of manhood that draws Olivia, or is there a deeper truth she cannot see? Perhaps she is but a mirror of the age, a jest of those who see only the surface. For swiftly indeed does Olivia shift her affections to Sebastian, casting aside the illusion of Cesario for the reality of another, finding in Viola not a lover but a sister. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315) And so the play unwinds, revealing the heart of things, the choices made and unmade, in the light of a world that turns on the axis of its own deception.",
            "In the shadowed annals of German dominion, there lies a tale of ruthless governance, one that saw the Ovaherero and Nama people pushed to the brink in the harsh expanse of German South West Africa. Yet to cast the entirety of an empire in so singular a hue is to overlook the variegated tapestry of its rule. The German colonial empire stretched across lands as diverse as its own methods, and within its borders, the matter of education took on many forms. When the British came to claim German East Africa in 1919, they uncovered a landscape peopled by Africans versed in letters and learning. German endeavors in Kamerun and other outposts were likewise acknowledged by the chroniclers of that age.\n\nBut in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the scene was starkly different. There, unlike the eastern lands where state schools sprouted under government auspices, education for the native populace was left to the missionaries, scantily aided by the state. The state, for its part, poured its efforts into the schooling of Europeans, crafting a network of state institutions and heavily backing the schools run by the missionaries. Such policies cast a long shadow over the land, persisting beyond the end of German rule. While other colonies could claim a populace schooled and literate, South West Africa was left wanting, its people largely untouched by the light of education.\n\nThe divergent path of South West Africa was carved by many hands, social, political, and economic forces all at play. This discourse seeks to unravel those threads, casting light on the settlers’ and officials’ perspectives towards the native peoples. A wealth of knowledge lies within the German chronicles of their empire, penned in a time when the empire itself still stood. These early missives sought to delineate the structure of education within the colonies. Later voices, speaking in English, widened the lens, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the particulars of each colony’s approach to education. Among these, Cohen’s examination stands out, a study that juxtaposes the educational landscapes of South West and East Africa, attributing much of the former's peculiarity to its sizeable European settler base.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to its sister colonies, was a land of moderate climes, though much of it lay under the sway of desert winds. It was this perceived gentleness that drew Europeans, their numbers swelling to nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark figure against the 5,336 settlers in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "In the broad expanse of history, there's the tale of two nations, America and Mexico, locked in a struggle that spanned the better part of fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, as set forth by Diehl and Goerts. This tumultuous stretch of time reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848, a conflict where the United States set upon Mexico and came away with the vast lands of Texas and the American Southwest. But the war was but a chapter in a long saga of skirmishes, a tale that only found its quietus in the years before the world was consumed by the First Great War. At the heart of this enmity lay a collision of faith, of culture, of the very bones of tradition, a chasm that yawned wide between the two peoples, as Schmitt recounts. \n\nAnd so it is that borders breed such discord, neighbors turned rivals by the soil they share and the interests they contest. America and Mexico, in their quarrel, are but echoes of many such rivalries etched upon the earth. David M. Pletcher speaks to this truth, noting that the thorn of American diplomacy finds its deepest roots only in Mexico and Cuba, nations pressed close by geography and history alike. Yet while others in the Latin lands have found warmth with America, these two stood apart, wrapped in the cloak of rivalry.\n\nReligion carved its own scar upon the land, a familiar story through the ages. Sally Frahm draws the parallel, likening the American aversion in centuries past to Catholicism and monarchy to a later century's disdain for fascism and communism. Ideologies clashed, not in the realm of governance but in the sanctuary of belief, a mistrust birthed from the enmity of English and Spanish forebears and carried forth by their colonial progeny. Such were the seeds sown in the hearts of nations, a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts recount seventeen disputes that marked the fifty-seven-year tapestry of rivalry, most born of the land, border raids, and the lawless fringes of frontier life. Bandits and outlaws haunted these borders, a specter that lingered until the militaries of both nations laid claim to their domains, as Schmitt describes.\n\nYet time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt tells of a shift, a softening, as Mexico's fate became entwined with that of the United States, the rivalry waning as America's gaze turned from conquest to commerce in the waning days of the nineteenth century. Thus, the story of two nations, bound by history, unfurls across the pages of time.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself shackled by a sickness I had not known, a malady creeping in like some unbidden guest in the night. I had been a nurse then, my hands accustomed to the work, drawn to the trade by the promise of safety, a security that eluded my youth. The words echoed in my mind, a refrain learned in the tender years of growing: \"You'll always find work; folks'll always fall ill.\" So it was that my dreams of science and the pen were set aside, and nursing claimed me.\n\nYet, there I stood, forty-six, unwed, pockets bare, unable to ply my trade. Still now, after a span of fifteen years, I remain ensnared by that which left me, a mendicant upon the mercy of Social Security, all that was once mine now scattered like leaves before the wind. Each day meets me with struggle, an affront to the fragile bastions of safety and esteem. Certainty's light is dim, yet one truth abides steadfast: without kin and a handful of steadfast companions, I would have been lost to the years, my strength a pale shadow against the tempest of disaster.\n\nIn life, there are storms and calms, and no prescience can guard against the tempests too vast for one soul to withstand. It is folly to place faith solely in the faltering machinery of government, worn and weary as it is. Instead, let us turn to one another, to the bonds forged in trust and aid, rather than retreat to the solitude of backyard bunkers.\n\nThe lore of rugged individualism is sung by some, yet it was not alone that our forebears weathered the harshness. It was compassion and respect, the pooling of what scant resources they had, that saw them through. Those who journeyed westward in their wagon trains did not reach the distant shore by solitary endeavor.\n\nPrepare, by all means. I do. A kit against disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheeting with tape to seal against unseen threats. Torches and their batteries, candles aplenty and matches that will not fail, stores of food in tins. If you have the land for it, let it yield its bounty, preserve what you can, and set a stove to warm you. But do not dwell in isolation.\n\nSeek out your neighbors. Know them.",
            "In an age lost to the mists of time, in the shadowed dawn of the fifth or sixth century before the Christ, there was born a prince who would one day cast off the trappings of his birthright, to wander the earth beneath the name of Buddha. Through the long arc of his life, he turned from the world and found enlightenment, and the echoes of his teachings would swell to form the river of Buddhism. The ancient current of it now bears the name Theravada, the oldest stream of those waters. Two thousand five hundred years of time have worn the edges of its doctrine, and what was once is not as it now appears. From the temples of Sri Lanka, the yearly rite of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds, a spectacle of devotion that Buddha himself never spoke of. Yet its absence in the old teachings does not diminish its place among the faithful. The changes, they run deep as they run wide, from the rituals of the surface to the very marrow of the soteriological bones of the faith. Theravada Buddhists, both the robed monks and the layfolk that follow, have bent and swayed under the weight of time, reshaping their beliefs in the face of forces seen and unseen, friend and foe alike.\n\nThere are words and terms that will shape this telling as we step into the shadows cast by these forces. There is the notion of the internal and the external. An internal force, born within the Buddhasasana, speaks with the voice of its own, whether monk or lay disciple. The external force breathes from beyond, a stranger’s breath. Hostile forces, like a storm, seek to rend and break, born of an eye turned cold upon the faith. Yet benign forces walk a different path, indifferent yet leaving their mark as they pass. These words will thread through the tale we tell.\n\nTo begin, we peer into the heart of the faith, the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the sacred text, holds the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka guards the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka unravels the mysteries of being. In these pages, words like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca whisper truths of no soul, suffering, and impermanence. To know them is to end Sansara, the wheel of rebirth that spins eternal. With its halt comes the end of desire, hatred, and delusion when enlightenment smiles upon the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka speaks of conduct, five precepts for the layman: to harm not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not in desire, to cloud not the mind with drink. For the monks, the path is narrower, bound by many more rules. Yet at the heart of it all rests the four noble truths: life is suffering, for suffering is born of attachment, and yet, it can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the world of negotiations, culture looms large and inscrutable, casting shadows both long and deep. It is a thing as much defined by its absence as by its presence, a wraithlike entity neither singular nor fixed. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese are obliging is to draw with too broad a brush on a canvas that demands subtlety. The seasoned negotiator knows well that understanding culture's role is paramount, for it colors each word spoken, each gesture made across the table's expanse. One cannot approach a foreign land without the lens of one's own custom, and in that meeting of worlds, comparisons arise as naturally as breath.\n\nTo fathom another's culture is a journey that traverses history and prejudice alike. It is not for the negotiator to judge or amend but to accept it in its manifold complexities, to navigate its currents whether the tide bears him forth with strength or leaves him adrift in open waters. When one finds oneself in the domain of another, respect is the key that unlocks the gate to understanding, smoothing the jagged edges of cultural divide and paving the way to forward progress.\n\nYet do not be deceived into believing that culture wears solely the guise of national identity. Within a single nation, companies cultivate their own peculiar gardens, each with its own rhythm and rules. Some demand the sacrifice of long hours, while others embrace a gentler pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, in the words exchanged, in the very fabric of their being. Philanthropy may be a calling for some, a controlled endeavor for others. Look to the American firms, each a world unto itself, and you will see the diversity of thought that thrives within the larger framework. Where others may seem uniform to the untrained eye, there lies beneath a complexity awaiting discovery.\n\nAnd so it is with values, the bedrock upon which culture stands. They whisper the reasons why, the guiding lights in a negotiator's path. If honor and harmony hold sway, you will not see a man denounce his kin to gain a foothold at the table. Conversely, a negotiator schooled in the art of the deal may bide his time, unhurried by the rush to resolution. The wise man takes heed of these truths before ever he sits to parley. Yet more than this, he seeks to know his adversary as a man, for it is in the personal that the heart of negotiation beats strongest.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. So begins the psalm and with it the discourse of Anselm, saint of old, pondering the existence of that which men call divine. In the shadow of this belief stands another, Thomas Aquinas, a name woven into the annals of theological debate. We are tasked here with weighing the words of these men, to see whose argument might bear the weight of truth. Yet for this endeavor, we presume both voices speak of the same God, the God of scripture, for to wander from this path would leave us adrift in a sea without anchor. In this light, one might suggest neither Anselm nor Aquinas offers a foundation whole and unbroken for belief in the divine.\n\nTo start, we turn to Anselm's meditations—a journey inward, a quest for understanding through faith alone. He tells us of God residing within the confines of human understanding, an existence so entrenched in the mind that to imagine otherwise is folly. Anselm's assertion, though couched in words that twist and turn upon themselves, boils down to this: the proof of God lies within the soul. His voice whispers that truth is a thing found not in the world beyond but within the heart, a faith untainted by the need for external validation. The mind, he says, holds the key.\n\nA different tune sings from the lips of Aquinas. Here is a man who sees God through the lens of reason, through the evidence of things seen and touched. Faith, in his eyes, is a crutch unnecessary for the proof of God. His arguments are fivefold, each a pillar of logic: the movement of things, the chain of causation, the necessity of existence, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the world. He speaks of a puzzle missing a piece, and with the rest assembled, one can discern the shape and nature of the absence without beholding it. Aquinas builds his case upon reason alone, a path laid out for the skeptic and the seeker alike.\n\nIn their words, these men lay out their truths. Anselm finds God within, a whisper in the quiet of the soul. Aquinas seeks him without, in the order of the universe. Yet neither, perhaps, captures the whole of it. The question lingers, unanswered, in the space between.",
            "The authors of the world wield their words like artisans, crafting with care the emotions they wish to instill in the hearts of those who read. Some among them are more adept, their techniques more potent. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel The Great Gatsby, is such a craftsman. He fashions feelings and thoughts through the pairing of adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways, casting an aura upon his subjects. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, colors among them—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. These hues, once laden with significance, serve to remind the reader of emotions tied to objects of import.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns to the colors white and gray a sense of sameness, with white a touch more refined, gray more worn and faded. From the novel’s start, he lays this groundwork. Daisy and Jordan, draped in white—always in white. Nick, too, dons white flannels for Gatsby's gathering, Tom a white shirt upon meeting Myrtle, Catherine powdered milky white. Only when Nick gathers his impressions of Gatsby’s revelries do the colors shift, halls gaudy with primary hues. Yet in the everyday, white and gray persist: Nick descends the white chasms of New York, names of Gatsby’s attendees now gray upon his timetable, Catherine’s apartment a slice in a long white cake, uniformity defined. The plain and the mundane bear these colors—Jordan and Daisy's shared white girlhood, the gray cars, gray land of the ash valley, the Italian child, gray, the dog-seller, a gray old man.\n\nOnce the colors white and gray hold meaning enough, Fitzgerald wields them to denote insignificance or conformity. It begins with Daisy, her portrayal after a long absence of these colors, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She is less a person, more a uniform piece, something Gatsby covets. More of this technique surrounds her, the gray haze of her fur collar, her white dress before Tom and Gatsby’s clash, all serving to render her a mere addition, uniform and desired.",
            "In the sunlit expanse of San Diego County, where the earth is generous and the sky ever blue, the land yields a bounty. Tomatoes and citrus and the dark greens of leafy crops rise from the soil alongside squash and broccoli, herbs of every scent, and the tree fruits—peaches and lemons—that hang like bright promises from their branches. Berries bend the bushes, honey seeps from the combs, and peppers lie in wait beneath the leaves. Here, the earth is kind, and it is no wonder that there is hunger for the organic, for food that ties its roots to the land and offers itself in all its purity. In this place, the farmers labor with their hands and their hearts, their names scrawled on long lists, waiting for a chance to share their harvest. Eggs and milk, too, are sought after, each organic farm a small world where the curious might wander, and birds might be watched and the trails might be walked under the sun's watchful gaze.\n\nYet the cost of this purity is great, for organic farming demands much of those who till the earth. It is labor without respite, a battle with weeds and pests fought without the armor of chemicals. The losses are not small, and the fields do not stretch as far as those of the great farms that spread their shadows across the land. To walk this path is to embrace greater costs, to labor beneath the sun with hands stained by the soil. But in the end, the land is richer, the air sweeter for the lack of poisons, and the creatures of the earth find refuge where once there was none.\n\nIn the shadows of Potrero, a small piece of land sits quiet and waiting. It is a part of the untamed world, where chaparral and grassland and oak woodland hold sway, nestled against the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. This land, 160 acres of it, lies under the watchful eye of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, a promise of protection for the fragile lives that dwell there. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the California gnatcatcher—all find their homes here, their futures uncertain.\n\nOnce, this place was home to those who came before, to the Native Americans whose traces linger in the earth, and later, to the settlers who turned the land to their purposes, ranching cattle and cutting wood. This land, an old homestead, holds the memories of those who came before, their lives etched into the soil.\n\nIn seeking to farm this land, I turned to the pages of the internet, to the listings that spoke of possibility. I sought the knowledge of programs that might ease the burden, that might keep the wild alive while allowing the farmer to thrive. In this, I found a model, an organic farm nearby that stands as testament to what might be, where the land is tended with care and the wild things find sanctuary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers as old as the hills and as unyielding as the earth. Within this bond lies a tapestry of emotions spun from the very threads of their shared blood. Love and pride and jealousy and cruelty. They see in each other a mirror, a reflection truer than any other for it is a reflection of themselves. When the hour grows dark and the world bears down upon them, the nature of this bond comes clear. The cost of such clarity is steep, for in understanding these emotions, one must grapple with the shadows they cast. To look upon a brother and see oneself is to reckon with the truth of one's own spirit, unmarred by the illusions spun by others. In the actions taken and the consequences borne, the essence of their character is revealed. Within \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their journey a tempest of emotion. Through a landscape rich and verdant, they tread a road to futility. Pride and disappointment clash in a storm, and only one shall emerge from the other side. The theme unfurls through the flesh of their interactions, the lens of the protagonist's view, as he wrestles with the world and his place within it. A world that shapes his actions as much as his heart.\n\nIt is pride that drives the protagonist, the kindling of his every act. From the first steps they took together to the final path they walked, pride lay heavy upon him. He bore resentment toward Doodle, for in his dreams he imagined a brother to teach of breath held long, of running, of leaping, or climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A brother to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the high branches of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was fragile, his heart a whisper in the chest of a boy who should not have lived. The dreams of the protagonist crumbled like dust, for such feats were beyond Doodle's reach. And in their ruin, he felt a darkness, a shadow of anger that turned his thoughts to violence. Yet even as he contemplated the unthinkable, the innocence of Doodle's smile melted the ice within him. A simple act, yet it bore the weight of hope, revealing that beneath the surface his love for his brother ran deep and true.",
            "The mind of man, a labyrinthine thing, a vessel of shadows and light, weaving the threads of thought into the tapestry of being. As the ages wore on and man's tools grew from stone to steel, so too did the symbols by which we understood this tangled skein evolve. Once it was but a waxen tablet or a papyrus scroll, a book of days unfurling in the light of the sun. Now they reckon it akin to the machines that hum and whir in the heart of the city. Yet one must tread with care, for these likenesses, though they offer a path, may lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning is the touch, the sound, the light. The world is a chorus of signals, and the mind is the conductor, transforming the raw into the refined. The senses gather their tribute, and the brain, with its silent algorithms, molds the clay of perception. It is a process both simple and profound, from the ground to the heavens. The eye beholds a black box upon a field of white, and the mind assembles the pieces: the color, the line, the space between. This is the work of the bottom, the foundation laid stone by stone. But the mind is swift, and the top guides the hand, recognizing the shape beyond the shadow, a box, not a void.\n\nYet the mind is also a keeper, guarding its gates with vigilance. Not all that comes is worthy of its gaze. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, each a whisper in the wind, but only the name spoken in a crowded room pierces the veil of thought. Attention, the sentinel, decides what shall pass, and the mind bends to its will, the dance of perception ever shifting.\n\nMemory is the storehouse of the mind, where the past is kept like treasures in a chest. There are chambers for the fleeting and the forever, each with its own key. First comes the mark, the impression made, be it the shape of a word or the sound of its name. Then the keeper must hold it fast, an echo in the mind's corridors. The scholars speak of signals weaving through neurons, or of proteins shaping the long halls where memories dwell.\n\nThe knowledge held within is a web, a network of meaning spun across the void. Some say it is a map, each thought a point connected by lines unseen. Here is \"chair,\" and there, \"table,\" with \"wooden\" bridging the distance. In the mind's eye, all is linked, a universe of thought, unfolding in silence.\n\nAnd so the mind goes on, a mystery to itself, seeking to know, to understand the world and its own depths, ever reaching, ever searching.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, a shadow fell upon the great expanse of the United States, a shadow born of financial ruin. A time when the earth itself seemed to shudder under the weight of its own sorrow. Unemployment swelled like a dark tide, the houses that once stood proud and sure crumbled into despair, and the mighty edifices of commerce, those towering behemoths, lay scattered in fragments upon the floor of the world. It was a time of reckoning, and the question that rose from the ashes was this: how had it come to pass, and what might save us from its grasp? \n\nIn the heart of the maelstrom lay a tale of folly, a tale of decisions made in dim-lit halls where shadows whispered of gain and glory. The banks and firms, those temples of currency, were goaded into handing out loans to those ill-prepared for such burdens, loans that were like stones cast into a vast and unyielding sea. And in this sea, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those titans of finance, found themselves ensnared, forced to weave these debts into the intricate tapestries of CDOs and CDSs. When the tide turned and the borrowers found themselves adrift, the banks had no harbor of capital to shelter them, and the storm swept through the land, leaving ruin in its wake. \n\nThe tale's beginning lay in the year of 1999, within the era of Clinton, a leader seeking the embrace of his people, yearning for the warmth of another term. And so he loosened the chains upon lending, setting the stage for a tragedy yet to unfold. Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke then with a voice of prophecy, saying, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's hand, urging it to open its coffers to those of lesser means, while the shareholders demanded their fill of profits.\" And Holmes, with the foresight of a sage, warned of the peril that lay ahead: a reckoning akin to that which befell the savings and loans of yore.\n\nThe storm brewed in many corners, its roots entwined with the newfangled mechanisms of finance. Mortgages that shifted with the wind, securities backed by dreams of shelter, and obligations collateralized until the very soul of the economy was tethered to the whims of the housing market. Households, like gamblers at a table, wagered all upon this fragile edifice, leaving themselves exposed to the cruelties of fate. \n\nAnd when the bubble burst, it was as if the very earth had opened beneath them. The financial giants, those masters of the universe, found themselves undone. The five great investment banks of the land bore debts of $4.1 trillion, a sum vast enough to shadow the nation's own bounty. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was unmade, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were reshaped into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in debt, were seized by the hand of the government in September of 2008, their fate now bound to the will of the state. \n\nSo it was, and so it is told. A tale of hubris and hope, of decisions made in the stillness of night that echoed across the years. A tale of the earth and its people, seeking always to find their way back to the light.",
            "In the quiet corners of a story's unfolding, there lies the place where the writer might weave a tapestry of words, a place where the tale could rise or falter. Here, the prose should sing, but often it drowns in its own excess, leaving the reader adrift, lost in the sea of too many words. There's a woman, Dr. Merlin, who knows the curse of this excess well, for she has been heard to rail against her screen when the burden of information grows too heavy to bear.\n\nExposition, that old betrayer, is no ally of yours.\n\nThe wise know the adage well enough: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet even Dr. Merlin finds herself ensnared in those long-winded passages where nothing stirs or too much unfolds all at once. Exposition whispers in your ear, urging you to lay bare the past so you might reach the heart of the tale quicker. But beware the other voice, the one that bids you to recount every childhood memory of each soul that walks through your pages.\n\nTo tell is to lay out the past plainly, in prose unadorned. In the flicker of film, it is when one character pours forth a litany of events, much like a mariner of old recounting his tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears this burden.\n\nPicture this: a tale where a woman meets her love, they wed in splendor, and then he perishes before her eyes. Such a story should not be penned in haste, two pages for a lifetime, with scant words exchanged between them. The pen should linger on the husband, his words and deeds a testament to the depth of his love. Likewise, the heroine should reveal in her every gesture how profoundly he shaped her world. Only then, when his loss is felt keenly, does the reader mourn with her and find themselves bound closer to her heart.\n\nIn essence, one expects the flesh upon the bare bones of \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAnd so, as a weaver of words, it falls to you to craft this flesh. There may come a moment when you wish to hasten, to merely sketch the outlines of a character—a man who once flew among the clouds, now grounded as a night manager at a gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman on weekends, his secret dream to own the station, having supped on Eggs Benedict that morning.\n\nBut the tale deserves more than a passing glance. It calls for the depth that only careful telling can provide.",
            "In the early light of a somber August morn, the news from Columbus, Ohio, unfolded with the disquiet of an unraveling tapestry. The first tale spun out from NBC 4, of a man named Shad Hostettler, whose visage bore the mark of malevolence. He had taken a blade to his wife in Ashley, Ohio, her name lost in the silence of the broadcast. His image, a shadow cast upon the screen, lingered but a moment, as the story was young and details sparse. They said he had stabbed her many times and now lay shackled by the law. Their telling was brief, a flicker of truth in the waking hours.\n\nThen came the news of a boy, Travis Buyers, just eighteen, his life hanging by a thread in Sharon Woods. A bullet had found him, and the emptiness of the street held no answers, no one to blame. The SWAT Team prowled the crime, a funeral march in the dawn. The story slipped by, a whisper in the ether, for Travis was a black boy, his plight swallowed by the void. The world, it seemed, turned its gaze elsewhere. I have seen this before, the neglect of those who wear the skin of night. But if it were a white child taken, the cries would echo through the hills.\n\nFurther along the path of words came the account of a Med-Flight helicopter, wings marred by a sniper's shot. A .22 caliber, they said, a phantom bullet in the sky. Crime-Stoppers called for justice, offering riches for the truth. \n\nThe rain too had its moment, the storms poised to break upon the earth come Saturday's end. The heat would cling to the weekend, they said, a prelude to keep eyes on the screen. \n\nA Clime Road UDF had been robbed, a shadow in a hoodie, they claimed, a man of dark skin, tall and lean. Their voices lingered on his color, as though it were a banner unfurled. \n\nAnd there was Rene Rodriguez, a name whispered in the halls of justice. A kingpin of drugs from Texas, they said, his empire reaching to Ohio. Twenty-five years behind bars, yet they spoke of 300 months, a curious choice of words. He was Hispanic, they noted, though the tale had no need of it. A detail thrown like dice upon the table, its purpose lost in the telling.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, stands as a curious beast in the realm of securities. It traces the path of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet it moves with the freedom of a stock upon the exchange. Like some mercurial creature, it offers the breadth of an index fund, yet the singular focus of a lone stock, allowing a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to grasp as little as one share in his hand. The allure is undeniable, with expense ratios whispering their lowly song, far beneath those of the usual mutual fund. Yet, like all things in this world, there are shadows cast. Commissions cling to trades involving ETFs, as they do with stocks, a toll paid to the guardians of the market. But the bounty is rich, the variety of funds as vast as the prairie sky. For the astute wanderer of finance, it's wise to test the promised treasures, to see if the riches of diversification truly lie within, and to what extent they shine. In this pursuit, we shall turn our gaze to the ETF IHF, measuring it against the ten stalwarts that form its heart, to see if the wealth of a solitary ETF matches the spread of a diverse portfolio of ten, or if there lies a better gathering of stocks, a more bountiful harvest of return.\n\nTo weigh the value of this ETF, we shan't burden ourselves with the entirety of its holdings, choosing instead the top ten, which account for a sturdy 63.58 percent of its assets. Below, the names of these ten and the weight they carry.\n\nIn seeking to understand how these ten stocks mirror the spirit of the ETF IHF, we can use the current percentage of assets, tempered to a full hundred, to reckon each stock's gift to the portfolio's Beta and Return, were the portfolio solely made of these ten, aligned as the ETF has drawn them. The numbers, their truths laid bare, follow in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a tale unfolds. A portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11 percent richer than the ETF, a bounty grown by 16 percent. The Beta, that measure of risk, sits .12 lower than that of the ETF entire. Thus far, the path of the ten might promise more gold with less peril. Yet, the specter of uncertainty remains, for it might be that the means of these two collections are not so different in the eyes of statistics.\n\nTo discern if these paths truly diverge, we must measure the variance of each of the ten stocks, each brought to the same scale, to compare their gathered variance to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the darkening months of the year, when the world turns inward and the frost seals the earth, there was a notable waning in the entries of the commuter logs, as if the very spirit of the undertaking had been smothered by the bleakness of winter. It was a thing to ponder, the reasons elusive as smoke on the wind. The cold had come, biting, to the New England campus, and it seemed to drive the people from their bicycles and their paths, back to the warmth of their cloistered lives, away from the open air where the breath is visible before the mouth in ghostly plumes. December, too, is a month of reckoning, a time when scholars and educators alike are bound up in the fever of final tasks, their minds a whirl of grades and closing acts. The simple act of recording their transit fell away from them, lost to the shadows of pressing duties. Then comes the holiday tide, the world turned over to celebration and pause, the halls empty themselves of their inhabitants, who are drawn away to their own sanctuaries, far from the tasks of academia.\n\nAnd so, with the coming of the spring semester in January's late days, one might expect a return, a resurgence of purpose. Yet February was a barren month for logs, the emptiness unexplained by reason alone. Perhaps it is the nature of such endeavors, to blaze brightly at inception and then to flicker as the days wear on. To stir the embers, we conjured the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a breath of life into the fading project, and for a time the logs filled again. The challenge then, as we found, was to sustain the fire through the quiet times, through the breaks and the lulls that are the very rhythm of the academic year.\n\nThere is another truth, deep and woven into the fabric of our lives—the allure of the automobile, the freedom it promises. It is a part of us, this independence, and so to draw folk away from their beloved cars, we offered gifts. Certificates for meals and coffee, for books and massages, small tokens to entice. Yet one wonders what might have been, had we offered greater temptations—a bicycle, a hybrid, an electric car. The prizes held steady through our months, and perhaps therein lay a misstep. Had we promised more as the year drew on, the engagement might have swelled. In December, a bicycle perhaps, and in the new year, a car that whispers of a future kinder to the earth. Such dreams might have kept the spark alive.",
            "In the dim chambers of memory, I found myself wandering through the archival corridors of the Library of Congress, seeking out the early Edison films—a collection of trickery captured from 1895 to 1901. These films, fifteen in their number, spun illusions through the deft hand of creative editing. My gaze was drawn to the poetics of these early trick films, noting the evolution that marked the outliers which dared to step beyond the bounds of their time. There was a steadfastness to these trick films, each one confined within its set, framed by the unyielding proscenium, the lens unmoving, capturing long and medium shots, each one a solitary vision. Yet, at the dawn of a new century, a few dared to defy, weaving multiple shots into their fabric. \n\nWhat you see often in these films is a stage, an interior set that holds its ground, the camera fixed as if it were a sentinel. It does not stir to follow the actors who move side to side, tethered to the stage like marionettes. Such was the way of the world then, the celluloid borrowing from the theater, from vaudeville and the art of illusion. The stage, it seems, was a cage, holding the performers from straying towards the camera, from breaching the fourth wall. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the players dance along the horizontal plane, never advancing, never retreating, and the camera holds its watch, unmoving. \n\nThis proscenium composition casts the shots in long takes, seldom granting the intimacy of a medium shot. Close-ups are a stranger in this world, the audience left to witness the performance in its entirety, as if seated in the velvet shadows of a theater. Actors remain distant, middle ground their domain, never venturing closer to the lens that captures them. \n\nIn these early days, each film a solitary shot, a single breath caught on film. These trick films, brief as a flicker, often mere minutes in length, constrained by the ceaseless ticking of frames. Their stories, if they can be called such, are but glimpses of vaudeville—magic acts, vanishing acts, transformations caught in the spotlight. Yet, within this singular shot in the viewer's eye, lies a truth unspoken—a dance of cuts and splices to conjure the apparition, to vanish the seen. Witness The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), and you may discern the seam where the magic is stitched, though to the eye it is as one.",
            "In the realm of the Gothic Novel, there exists a peculiar conundrum, an oxymoron of sorts, the \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt names it in his musings on the genre's rise. This Gothic mode has been both scorned and revered, condemned for its shallow roots and exalted for the terrible sublime it conjures, as Burke might say. The first of its kind, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, wove together the threads of the ancient and the modern, birthing a new order of literary expression. Walpole reached back to the old stagecraft and intertwined it with the mimicry of nature that the modern novel embraced, calling it \"A Gothic Story.\" The genre, steeped in echoes of medieval theater and architecture, carried the weight of old traditions. Even in Otranto's time, \"gothic\" was a word bandied about to describe a myriad of peoples, styles, and epochs. It was seen as relic-like, unsophisticated beside the gleaming advancements of modern society and literature. Yet, it is this blend of the old, theatrical Gothic with the new narrative form, offering an intimate glimpse into the psyche of its characters, that allows the Gothic to endure, to be at once obsolete and novel to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nAmong the tenets of the Gothic is the notion of Chivalry—an idea both preserved and reshaped in Walpole's tale. This medieval code, the making of a knight both brave and just, was a beacon for Gothic scribes, representing an ideal lost to the ages. Walpole, writing amidst political tumult and shadowed by accusations, clung to this vision of chivalric virtue, perhaps sensing its absence in his own world. Within his pages, characters like Frederic embody this ideal, appearing as the paragon of knightly virtue, a prince marked by suffering and tragedy, thought to have fallen to infidels. Here is the gallant and courteous Knight, exaggerated in form, setting the stage for the Gothic's future dalliance with excess.",
            "The world of supply chains is a silent orchestration, a stream of processes that move like a river through the landscape of commerce. From the moment a customer places an order, the journey of goods begins, winding its way through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until it reaches the waiting hands of the consumer. It was in the pale light of 1982 that Keith Oliver, a consultant, gave a name to this intricate dance—supply chain management. He spoke of the planning, the execution, and the oversight that is required to meet the needs of customers swiftly and without falter.\n\nThere are six pillars upon which this vast structure rests: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools by which managers craft their art, each decision a brushstroke on the canvas of customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins, the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Here, the when and the why, the where and the how, all take shape. Managers look to the market, that ever-shifting sea, to discern the desires of the customer. They read its currents and decide what should be made and how much of it. The place of creation is chosen with care, each plant selected for its ability to meet the demands of volume and quality, with the customer's satisfaction as the guiding star. Workloads are scheduled, machines are readied, and the wheels of production turn. Every detail is a thread in the tapestry, for if any are missed, the cost, in time and money, could be great.\n\nI remember my own time at Wal-Mart and Target, those sprawling empires of retail. Each had its own design, a booklet, a process for every part of the business. A uniform laid out just so, shipments received with a precision that left no room for error. These outlines, these maps, they allowed the company to move smoothly, without the confusion that so often accompanies a lack of direction.\n\nThe next pillar is supply, a realm of strategic decisions that determine the core capabilities of a facility. From these decisions, partnerships grow, some within the company, others outsourced to those beyond its walls. Each division, each piece of equipment, each worker, all are chosen for their fit in this grand design. Sometimes, work is handed to others, a choice made in the name of velocity—the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. It is a decision made in the quiet of a manager's mind, a choice that sends ripples across the surface, unseen but felt.\n\nIn this world of interwoven paths and unseen connections, the supply chain moves ever forward, a testament to the silent artistry of those who guide it.",
            "In the heart of Victorian literature lies an intricate tapestry woven with meticulous detail and an unwavering gaze upon the aristocracy. Yet, among these grand narratives, two novels stand apart, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each straying from the beaten path, weaving mystery and the bizarre into their fabric. This deviation lends a peculiar strength to their characters, unraveling the depths of their motives and baring the raw sinew of their emotions. \n\nThere comes a passage in Oliver Twist where bewilderment and confusion clamber over the mind like shadowy specters. Young Oliver finds himself ensnared between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices lingering in his ears, a dreamlike echo of reality. He speaks to them as if they were there, flesh and bone, until suddenly the crack of gunfire shatters the air. Cries and shouts rise up, a tumult of noise and light, as unseen hands whisk him away. Through this tempest of visions, an unrelenting pain gnaws at him, a torment unending.\n\nThe novel drifts into these dreamscapes, these ethereal realms, to unearth truths buried within Oliver, to peel back the layers of what torments him, and to reveal his understanding of the world’s grim visage. When the gunshot that felled Oliver returns to the fore in chapter 28, it is relived in a vivid, dreamlike state. The experience underscores the powerlessness that grips him, the precarious state of his health reflected in the spectral figures of Sikes and Crackit that haunt his fevered mind. The gunshot overwhelms him, his senses dulled, and yet he feels the unseen hand that carries him, a constant pain now intertwined with fear, not the surprise of a sudden wound. There arises the question of whose hand guides this misfortune, for it is not Oliver’s own. This event fortifies the notion of his helplessness, a boy adrift, unable to seize the reins of fate even as his life hangs by a thread. A creeping despair gnaws at him, as if old Fagin has begun to weave his dark spell, sapping Oliver’s will to fight, bending him to this despair, shackling his spirit. For otherwise, one might think Oliver would strive, if only for the preservation of his own life.\n\nAs one day bleeds into the next, night descends, a cloak of dread. Time stretches and contracts, a silence both endless and fleeting, each hour slipping by like a ghost in the dark.",
            "In the days gone by, I found myself working in a place that was a tether for young minds, a sanctuary in the after hours where children sought knowledge. They came with their books and their questions, and I did my part to guide them through the labyrinth of words and numbers. My realm was English, the art of reading, and it was there that I was summoned to aid a boy named Adrian. His troubles with words were peculiar, a mystery wrapped in the simplicity of childhood. Some letters he conquered with ease, while others eluded him like shadows in the twilight. He was a child of Latino descent, his tongue fluent in the language of this land, yet there was a chasm in his reading that we could not bridge. \n\nIt was not until his mother came that the fog lifted. She spoke only in her native tongue, Spanish, and with my meager grasp of her language, we managed to communicate. And it was then that the truth came to me, simple and profound as any revelation. Adrian did not falter in reading; he merely stumbled upon an alphabet unfamiliar to his home. Whether this realization changed his path, I cannot say. But I hold hope that the boy found his way.\n\nI tell this tale to shed a light on the barriers that rise in the halls of learning, especially here in California. It is a reminder that the obstacle is not always as it seems. Even a child fluent in the spoken word may find reading to be a mountain steep and unyielding. The problem is known to all, yet the solution remains elusive. For Adrian, the answer lay in tutoring, a simple path through the maze of letters and sounds. But for many, the journey is more complex, with no single beacon to guide the way. The truth is woven in the tapestry of dual language systems, immersion, tutors, and ESL classes. None alone can mend the breach; together, they hold the key.\n\nThe dual language system, an idea with promise, not just for those whose first words were in Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs rise above their peers. Yet fear cloaks this idea, whispers of wasted resources and benefits lost on the many. But this is not the truth. If such programs were the rule, not the exception, all would find gain in their embrace. But how do we traverse this path? Should we demand all teachers to speak in two tongues? Such a notion is folly. Yet, there is no reason we cannot have those who walk beside the children, guides fluent in both worlds, to aid them on their journey.",
            "From the time we are small, they tell us of a world beyond our own, vast and unfathomable, a realm of mystery where answers are sought in the pews of the faithful or in the silent chambers of the heart. Some of us take with open hands the doctrines handed down by our kin, while others turn away, denying the beyond in favor of a solitary universe where the self reigns supreme. We wander from one creed to another, casting off the old like a snake shedding its skin, always searching for a meaning that fits. We seek not just the light but the shape of ourselves that this light might reveal, a beacon against the encroaching dark.\n\nA cardinal, my father whispered when I asked him which bird sang sweetest to his soul. We sat there on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin above like the slow march of time. Smoke curled upward from our cigarettes, mingling with the damp air. The rainwater coursed down the gutters, drowning the flowers at the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, eyes lost in some distant place, memories flickering like shadows on a cave wall. His frame had withered, clothes hanging loose on his thinning body, hair sparse as the leaves in November. He looked past me, through me, and I felt the chill of solitude, the words lodged in my throat unspoken, for to speak them was to give truth to the fear gnawing at my heart. I drew close, and together we watched the June rain fall, a silent communion.\n\nThe December that followed stole him away, five days beyond the mark of my twenty-second year. The treatments had carved more time from the stone, yet the worth of those days lay heavy with suffering. What kind of God, I wondered, metes out such cruelty? In the stillness of night, I found no solace in prayer, the thought of a listening deity long since abandoned.\n\nI could not bear witness to his crossing from this life to the next. I chose not to. I wished to hold in my heart the father who lived, not the shadow of his leaving. I knew him better than any, better than those who gathered to mark his passing, and knew he would not have wanted his child to see the light fade. Alone, I curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the words that never came.\n\nNo one called. The world turned, indifferent.",
            "In the quiet vastness of fields stretching far and wide lay the heart and mind of John Taylor of Caroline, a man bound to the soil and the creed of Republicanism. His hands, once upon plowshares, turned briefly to the affairs of state, crafting a voice unyielding in its clamor for freedom's breadth and the restraint of government. His was a vision rooted deep in the earth, an agrarian truth shaping his every thought on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the laws that govern men.\n\nTaylor saw in the burgeoning land of America a canvas unmarked by the traditions of old, a place where the ideal of self-rule might flourish. He spoke of natural rights, bound inexorably one to another, each fragile as a sparrow's wing, and should one be clipped, the others falter and fall. These rights, he argued, must remain untouched by the hands of governance. In the wild state of nature, strength and cunning reigned supreme, yet in the realm of civilization, such a hierarchy must not stand.\n\nTo forge his vision of society, Taylor called for a governance that acknowledged the light and shadow within each soul. He held steadfast to a morality of duality, proclaiming that as men wielded power, their virtues and vices were but reflections of themselves. Good governance, he claimed, lay in the safeguarding of property, the nurturing of the land, and the tempering of unchecked capitalism. Though all men were driven by self-interest, it was only sin when it transgressed beyond the welfare of the commonweal into realms of exploitation. A righteous government would bind man's darker intents, though it too must be watched lest it stray into wickedness.\n\nIn the manner of the staunch Republicans of his age, Taylor demanded a strict reading of the Constitution, a Federal power constrained by the words therein, no more, no less. For a sprawling Federal reach was costly and prone to tyranny. Yet he knew that mere literalism was fraught with peril, a path to corruption unless the spirit of the framers guided its course. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true covenant, for it spoke plainly of a union of sovereign states, not a single nation.\n\nThus, John Taylor stood, a man of the land, his ideals as wide as the horizon, as enduring as the earth beneath his feet, ever guarding the fragile balance between liberty and authority.",
            "He stood there staring downwards, his mind a blank canvas trying to comprehend the sight before him. Unfeeling, silent, the practiced gaze of one who observes without attaching meaning, his mind dissected the scene laid out before his eyes. Thoughts drifted in and out, faster than they came, seamless and smooth, leaving him to wonder if they were his thoughts at all or merely a stream of consciousness that flowed unbidden through his being.\n\nThere was a time, long ago, when an artist he'd known told him to buy a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. He'd sought to learn the art of drawing since he was a child of six, and the book promised to teach everything from the understanding of a pencil to the brain's perception of lines. One lesson it taught was to encase any image within a square frame, turning the chaos of a complex view—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room—into something simple and comprehensible. That bowl of fruit on a plain, uncomplicated plane.\n\nYet now, as he gazed down at the bowl before him, he found no such frame in his mind. Overwhelmed, awed, he could do nothing but stand there, wonderstruck. They spoke of Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of green, the Renaissance masters' spectrum of color. If he fancied himself worthy of the Artistic, then before him lay the genesis of his canvas, the inception of his tale, his own Work in Brown.\n\nHis fingertips brushed the tool of his artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as his hand moved through the air, the will of his mind taking form in what might have been the most creative moment of his life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off to oblivion. His muscles tensed again, more swiftly, more anxiously, as his hand struck once more at the lever. But the stubborn brown mass clung to the bowl's bottom like a slug.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted a foot apart, the green tie uncomfortably tight around his neck, he frowned at the crude parcel of processed animal and plant left as a message for the hapless souls tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's restrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, then his hand reached for the wall, grasping the end of the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, his hand descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "In the dim corridors of the world, young souls find themselves behind the wheel, where the shadows of fate and inexperience converge. The youngest among us, these tender drivers, are caught in a deadly dance, a tapestry of statistics woven with the threads of their youth. The National Institutes of Health speak of this, a tale told by the very architecture of the adolescent mind, unready for the perils that lie in wait on the open road. Inexperience, too, is a silent companion, whispering of rollovers and roads left behind, of speed that outpaces wisdom.\n\nIn the company of their peers, they fare worse still, a truth known by any with a flicker of insight. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation, a grim ledger of age against the tally of accidents. California, among others, seeks to shield them, crafting provisional licenses to bind their hours and bar their young companions. Yet these measures are but fleeting gestures against the storm. The truth of it is stark: these youngest travelers, by any reckoning, are ill-equipped for the burdens they bear.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman casts his gaze further, deeming eighteen too tender an age. USA Today echoes his findings, of a yearning in those beneath nineteen for the thrill of risk, a hunger that outpaces caution. And so, reason whispers of delay, of holding back the keys until the fires of youthful daring cool. Elsewise, we face a future of lives scattered on the asphalt, a toll of loss that threatens to climb, as the children of Baby Boomers come of age, a legion ready to claim the road.\n\nThe path forward is clear and unbarred by complexity. Schools might still teach the ways of the wheel, planting seeds for drivers yet to come. But the road itself would wait for those under eighteen, a privilege postponed. A provisional permit, a precursor to full freedom, could be their guide, with hours of training to temper the journey. The number of these hours might echo the requirements of states like California, where six hours behind the wheel and fifty in practice are the norm.\n\nThe specter of youth behind the wheel spans the nation, and so should our response. Uniform laws, national in their reach, could shield our young from coast to coast. In this, there is nothing new, only the quiet wisdom of prevention, a shield raised against the dark.",
            "In the dry and clinical corridors of understanding, this paper walks through the shadowed paths of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, known to some as CAPD. It first sets forth a definition, brief as the breath of a dying wind. Then it turns to the matter of diagnosis, laying out the common signs, the red flags, as they are known. Lastly, it speaks to the teachers, those guides in the mainstream classrooms, on how they might shepherd a student afflicted with this disorder.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or by another name Auditory Processing Disorder, whispers of the workings of the central nervous system, the brain's dance with sounds. It is the efficiency, the effectiveness, with which this system uses what is heard. Narrowly drawn, (C)AP concerns itself with how the central nervous system perceives auditory information, the neurobiological chorus behind this, and the strange electric potentials that it births. Simply, it is a disorder where the brain, the very seat of our understanding, cannot properly weave the sounds into meaning. Those who carry this burden hear as others do, and thus are not named among the hearing impaired; rather, it is the brain's translation of sound, the separation of words from noise, that falters.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder trace back to the mid-1950s, spoken of then as \"auditory imperception.\" It was a time when researchers turned their gaze to children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian trio, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began crafting tests for such children. By 1961, Kimura brought forth dichotic testing, crafting a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system, the CANS, that underlies dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 stirred the waters of research further, drawing attention to children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD shows itself in manifold ways. Those touched by it may find sound an elusive specter, unable to place it in space. They may struggle to tell apart two or more acoustic events, each sound occurrence a puzzle. Recognizing sound patterns may elude them, and detecting changes in speech, the subtle sarcasm that rides on a change of voice, may pass unheard. One sound might be swallowed by another. They may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues, interpreting them in a way that invites action, and might also be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is presented.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, one must peer through a lens of systematic observation, watching the listening behaviors and performance on tests of auditory function. A host of voices—those of audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others—use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. This may be done with questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the patient responds to stimuli. Yet, as of now, there is no singular instrument, no test wielded with consistent success, and the cause of the disorder remains a mystery. Many tests present the patient with a cacophony of simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to pick out certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests listen to the echoes within the ear, measuring the responses to these acoustic signals.",
            "In the quiet corridors of my aspirations, I find myself drawn to the path of social work, a calling whispered by the winds of compassion and resolve. My heart beats to the rhythm of service, a cadence of respect and ethics, a melody of commitment not just for others but for the growth of my own soul. These values stand as sentinels in my journey toward aiding the Division of Family and Children Services, where I seek to be a beacon for children lost in the shadows of neglect and a guide for families wandering amidst their own storms.\n\nIn my early days, the direction was uncertain, a landscape of choices veiled in mist. High school and college unfolded, revealing to me a world where many fled from their demons, seeking solace in illusions that offered none. In these moments, I chose psychology, a lens to peer into the human heart. Yet, upon the completion of my studies at Piedmont College in that summer of 2009, I found myself at a crossroads, the road ahead obscured until fate intervened.\n\nIt was a day like any other when I met a boy, sixteen and burdened by the weight of his home. He sat on the couch, the air heavy with the silent cries of his spirit. His tale was one of escape from hands that should have nurtured but instead brought harm. The law stood silent, impotent in the face of his cries, and so I stepped forward, my voice a plea for understanding. I spoke to the parents, their words a tapestry of excuses, each thread woven with denial. It was then, amidst the echoes of that encounter, that the path of social work unfurled before me, a road paved with the resolve to untangle such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nJustice, a word often spoken and seldom understood, burns in me like a flame unyielding. Society, in its contradictions, lauds the individual yet molds us in its image. In my defiance, I have colored my hair in hues unnatural, worn garments that spoke my truth, pierced the ears of convention, and stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tides of prejudice. I am an individual, bound not by the chains of tradition but by the call of justice. My journey will continue, a protest against the injustices that stain our world.\n\nAnd so I walk this path, a wanderer with purpose. Each step echoes with the resolve to heal, to guide, to uplift. For in the end, it is not the road we travel but the lives we touch that define us.",
            "In the depths of night, when the world lay shrouded in a quietude so absolute, there stirred a restlessness born not of choice but of the very marrow of one’s being. This paper delves into the realm of insomnia, exploring the paths carved by the Biological and Sociocultural models upon the landscape of this affliction. The Biological model speaks of the whispers of ancestry in the blood, of genetic blueprints passed down, of the corporeal maladies that bind us. In contrast, the Sociocultural model weaves its tale of the world without, of the ties tethered to the air we breathe, the lands we walk, the myriad faces and stories that shape our lives. It is here that we lay bare the findings, dissecting each study, each scrap of knowledge, to better illuminate the models’ truths, their flaws and their merits.\n\nA sleep disorder, a specter that shadows the mind, may arise as a solitary beast, or it may be the handmaiden of other specters, other disorders that dwell within the psyche. These primal sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, they speak of nights where the body rebels, where sleep neither comes nor stays, or where it comes unbidden, like a thief in the night. Dyssomnias, they are sleep's betrayals—Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy with its sudden surrender to the abyss, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, the misaligned rhythms of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the vagueness of Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias, they are the dreams that walk the earth—Nightmare Disorder, the terrors, the somnambulist's path, each a tale of sleep entwined with waking. And there are others, linked to the disorders of mind, the Axis I and Axis II maladies, where sleep is but another casualty. This review, it peers into the heart of insomnia, seeking the threads of these models amidst the tangle.\n\nIn the Biological model, the tale is one of the flesh and the blood, of the genes that sing in silent harmony, shaping the night’s repose. Neurons nestled within the hypothalamus, they hold the key, the orexin that orchestrates the dance of sleep and wakefulness. In the laboratory's sterile light, they watched the mice, saw how phenotypic GABAB receptors played their part upon the orexin neurons. The activation of these receptors, by GABAA, a siren song that lulls to sleep. When silenced, anxiety slumbers and sleep takes hold. Baclofen, the GABAB agonist, it stretched the hours of sleep (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, they whisper of a kinship between the mouse and the human, a shared fate written in the genetic code. The absence or flaw of this receptor, it could spell a lifetime of nights unfulfilled without the balm of medicine. And in the Sociocultural sphere, the implications ripple outward. If this trait be inherited, then it shapes a life, a destiny where sleep is elusive, where the waking hours grow heavy with fatigue, casting shadows over the endeavors of life, the labor and the mundane.\n\nThus is the story told, of insomnia through the lens of these models, a tapestry woven of the threads of biology and the patterns of the world beyond.",
            "In the time since I've taken root here at University Park, near three years now or the span of four and a half semesters, I've come to know the lay of the land, its paths and ways, and found them wanting. For many, myself included, the act of moving from one end of this sprawling campus to the other is fraught with challenges. Back in my freshman days they set me down in an East Halls dormitory, a place so far flung it lay nearly at the eastern edge of the campus, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from Stuart Hall, my abode, to the likes of the Willard building, toward the heart of campus, could stretch nigh to a half hour on foot, more so when the weather turned sour, which it often does in this town called State College. I spoke once with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who told tales of a time when East Halls stood apart, separated by vast swathes of barren land. Now that emptiness is filled, sports fields and grand new edifices rising, the Creamery and a health services building, apartments encircling all. As the campus grows, so too does the struggle of traversing it. What might be the answer to this vexation of movement? On such a ground as this, the bicycle is king. Yet the bike alone is no balm. The students must mount and ride, and the campus must be shaped to meet the needs of those who pedal.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who has taken up cycling again after years of neglect. He mused aloud, puzzled at his own forsaking of it. \"Bicycles are remarkable,\" he said. \"There was a time when it seemed uncouth to ride, yet it's the only way to traverse these distances.\" Beyond the boon to one's own flesh, bicycling is the swiftest means to journey. A bowl of oatmeal, a bit of sweat, and you'll cover miles aplenty. Like many others, I dwell off campus now, as far from its center as some dormitories lie. This year the wisest choice I made was to procure a bicycle. Each day finds me in the Thomas building, a place that by foot is a lengthy march of twenty-five minutes from my dwelling. A bicycle cuts that time to a mere five if I push the pedals with vigor. Yet Pollock Road, the most direct path to Thomas from my abode, is no easy ride. There's merit in walking, sure enough, but time is a luxury I lack. Without my bike, I'd be left with walking as the sole reliable means to reach my classes. To stride to Thomas each day would steal an extra half-hour or more from my time, a toll of over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the minutes spent walking to other classes, to meetings, and so on, and the cost is more than I can afford.",
            "In the land where Aldous Huxley sets his tale, the world has become a place estranged from the sanctity of the individual. A place where the hum of machinery and the relentless drive of the market have forged a new order. Brave New World, he called it, and yet it was anything but. The people there, molded from birth to seek only the fleeting joy of the moment, their souls traded for comfort and convenience. They are but pieces on a board, moved by unseen hands, their lives dictated by the grand design of the World Controller. To peer through the veil with the eyes of Marxist thought is to see the shadows cast by Huxley's suspicions of the rising tides of technology and commerce. The words of Marx echo in the fabric of the story, terms like reification and hegemony serving as signposts pointing to the flaws of an economy still in its infancy during Huxley’s time.\n\nIn this world, capitalism is laid bare, skinned to its bones by the concept of false consciousness. The people, blind to the strings that bind them, care only for their own gain, their understanding of class relations blurred. It is the work of ideological sorcery, the masses conditioned to believe in their own supremacy as long as they toe the line, consume, and adhere to the dictates of the World Controller. The lower echelons, the Deltas and Gammas, know not their masters, their wills bent and broken by the whispers of hypnopædia. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet inert, accept their roles, save for the few like Bernard who dare to dream otherwise. Here, the dance of social classes speaks volumes of the perceived chains of capitalism, shackling the soul and spirit alike.\n\nIn this world of Huxley’s creation, true kinship is a ghost long laid to rest. Characters drift through the narrative, ghosts of depth and dimension, as if Huxley suggests that the march of technology and the creed of capitalism rob man of his will and his heart. Love is a relic, emotions dulled to the point of oblivion. Men speak of women as objects, their worth measured by their appearance, the women recounting their encounters with a stark detachment. Each class, snug in its place, mirrors the socioeconomic chains of capitalism. Their unwavering fealty to their role in society mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, convinced of their worth as long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was almost four years past when I took a course in Islam at CBC, a time when the room would fill with debates that would rise and fall like the breath of a sleeping beast. The question that burned most was whether Islam bore the face of hostility. That question has not withered with the passage of days but grown more relevant, as if nourished by the events since the shadow of 9/11. I have watched the great machine of mass media shift its gaze from a stance of hostility toward Islam's fervent sons to a tolerance so extreme it perches on the brink of oblivion. In that year of 2001, it seemed that a man with the name Borac Obama, with roots tangled in the rich soil of a Muslim heritage, might never have stood in the light of candidacy for the presidency.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as laid bare in his biography, pulls at the threads of intrigue within me. It tells a tale that seems at odds with the man history has long whispered to me. In the echoes of my learning and knowing, I was led to believe that Muhammad pressed his faith upon others like a blacksmith hammering iron into the shape of his will. They spoke of a man who would conquer and claim tribes, bending them to the creed of Islam. Yet, the recounting of his life paints him in hues of a martyr, misunderstood and humble in his dealings. People, it says, came to him, drawn by the 'truth' that shone from his teachings as moths to the flame.\n\nThere are stories woven into this tapestry of his life that bear resemblance to the ministries of Jesus and the wonders that followed in his wake. Chief among them is the tale of mutton and milk multiplied, a bounty feeding forty men. It strikes me as a deliberate echo, a desire to cast Muhammad as a prophet of humility, one who walked in miracles without the need to prove his worth. This troubles me, for it seems a theft of the life and light of Jesus Christ, an attempt to claim that sacred story through the shadow of another.\n\nThe biography is littered with tales, an agenda of witness and conversion, yet many are told from distant voices, echoes of so-and-so who heard from so-and-so. Such accounts, meant to bolster truth, instead unravel into suspicion, casting shadows on their veracity.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the lifting up of Muhammad as a man of godly virtue, humble and wise, gentle in his ways. History, as I have known it, speaks a different tale, one of power and conquest, and I wonder if those who follow him today know the true shape of the man who carved their path.",
            "In the time after the passing of the Nazarene, the path of thought that bore his name wandered far from the teachings he once imparted. A man might stand at the river's edge and trace the flow of Christian thought as it drifted from its wellspring, a current unmoored from the life that once was. The world now reflects a burgeoning consciousness, a stir of minds unshackling from the ancient fetters of tradition. Yet, there are those who cling to the teachings instilled within them, their voices a whisper against the gale of change. But these voices may not rise loud enough to steer the course of what is to come. Among the faithful, an understanding will swell, a longing to peel back the layers of time and see the truth of the man whose name they bear. It will be a slow turning, like the grinding of the earth beneath the stars, but turn it will. The tide of history will shift, flowing backward to the time before doctrines encased the light of his words. A movement will arise, each hand pulling away the veils of creed until what remains is the simple vision of what the Nazarene spoke of in the name of the divine.\n\nAs this great reversion sweeps through the lands of America and Europe, men and women will gather to worship not in the ways of kings or popes but as those who walked beside him. The church, an ancient bastion, will guide them still. Yet with this backward journey, the myriad beliefs that once spread like branches will draw together, each branch reaching for the same root. Across the lands, across the divides of belief, the differences will fade and a new sameness will take their place. History tells of reversions such as these. Was not the Roman Empire once the persecutor, now a vessel of faith? Did not this nation rise from the bondage of a people to their ascension in its leadership? In days to come, such a reversion will unfold within the faith, a cleansing of the many in search of the one. It is vital to understand that this path backward will be marked by a reading of his words as parables, not law. And so we ask, what has transpired since those days of the Nazarene?\n\nTo look back, far back, is to find the cradle of faith in the Jewish tradition, the theological forebear of the Christian line. Monotheism, the sacred bond of revelation, the authority of the scriptures of old, these were the pillars upon which the faith stood as the Romans marched into Jerusalem in the year of 63 before the Common Era. Yet, even then, the children of Israel were not of one heart. They were divided, the Sadducees and Pharisees, the Essenes and Zealots, and the many who walked the common paths.",
            "In the pages of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the raw sinews of human nature, exposing the intrinsic greed and self-interest that lurks within. Man toils not for the betterment of all but to elevate himself above the rest, blind to the plight of those beneath him. The sprawling factories stand as monuments to this greed, their owners and overseers caring little for the souls crushed in their relentless pursuit of greatness. These edifices rise against the sky, the chimneys belching smoke that trails to the world's end, a testament to the havoc wrought without heed or care for man or beast. The poison they spill forth and the waste that runs unchecked from the pens of Packingtown are of no concern to those who rule over them.\n\nThese captains of industry, steely-eyed and unyielding, care not for the flesh and blood that swell their coffers. The workers, little more than cogs in a vast machine, are squeezed for every ounce of worth. This cauldron of envy and hatred knows no loyalty, no decency, where a man is naught but a shadow against the gleam of a dollar. They labor under the whip of hours unending, cast aside without notice, left to fend in a world uncaring. Laws to shield them are but dreams, and the managers wield their power unchecked, driving men to the brink in pursuit of progress. The book does not speak it plainly, yet the message resonates—the souls who ground themselves to dust in Packingtown were left to the mercy of their harsh fate, bereft of aid or counsel.\n\nUnions rose like false prophets, promising salvation, yet often they too sought their slice of flesh. The workers, caught in this web, were likened to slaves, shackled to a system as brutal and indifferent as any master of old. Here stood a populace, foreign and lowly, teetering on the edge of want, bound to the caprice of men as ruthless as the slave drivers of yore. In such a world, immorality is not a choice but a certainty, as inevitable as the tides, as pervasive as the shadows cast by the relentless advance of industry.",
            "In the somber expanse of Edgar Allan Poe's poetic endeavors lies \"Dream-Land,\" a work he held in high regard. Within its verses, the word \"Thulé\" appears in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, a term traced by Mabbott to the ancient Virgil. Virgil spoke of Thulé as an island beyond Britain, the fringe of the known world to the Greeks. That Virgil wielded the term is beyond doubt, yet another source casts its shadow upon it, one more modern, yet steeped in the past. Poe, with his gaze ever turned toward the Germanic realms, was drawn to their authors as a moth to flame.\n\nA particular passage illuminates Poe's acquaintance with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on Poe’s \"Politian\" and Goethe’s \"Mignon,\" remarks upon the kinship of their verses, suggesting an echo of Goethe in Poe's own cadence. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe, that luminary of letters, whose opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" found daylight in two parts, the first breathing in 1808, the second exhaling in the fateful year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Nestled within the latter part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" It tells of a monarch whose queen's departure leaves him bereft, clinging to a goblet she gifted him. In his grief, he drowns his soul in drink, the specter of his queen ever beside him. At last, he bequeaths his realm to his progeny, save the goblet, casting it into the sea before closing his eyes forever. The king in Goethe's verse and the figure in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stand as shadowed twins, perhaps reflections of Poe's own loss and solace found at the bottle's bottom. A romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842 rendered \"Faust\" anew, mere months before Poe let Thulé slip into \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe spoke of Thulé twice across his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he invokes \"ultima Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" the term bookends the poem, framing its spectral journey. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" could be read as kin, each echoing the other's lament. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker wanders through a Thulé of shadows, a barren realm haunted by shades of the past, devoid of hue and warmth. These vistas mirror those in Goethe’s \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, bereft of queen and purpose, treads a twilight path. Poe's verse seems to step into Goethe's own, a pilgrimage through shared sorrow.\n\nGoethe's name would have been known to Poe, if not through his own reading, then through the admiration he held for Tennyson, who in turn revered Goethe. When asked of Tennyson, Poe's words betray his respect. But beyond Tennyson lay Goethe's own work, a tide of translations and adaptations flooding the literary world following its initial release. In this tide, Poe surely found himself adrift.",
            "In the land of California where laws are like the shifting sands, a question arises from the commonplace yet portentous act of slipping on applesauce in a grocery store. Could a customer, bruised by such a fall, find in her favor punitive damages when the store's steward acted with malice, having twice been told of the spill and yet left it unattended for the span of a half-hour, his mind more on his supper than on his duty? \n\nThe hand of the judge may not easily sweep away Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive recompense. To bring forth such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the offending party acted with a willful and conscious neglect of the harm likely to ensue, and that such conduct bore the mark of contemptible disregard. Palmer might argue that Martin, the keeper of the store, should have foreseen the peril of neglecting the spill, for in the months before her misfortune, others had fallen prey to similar slips; yet with this knowledge, he did nothing. While her assertion that Martin’s actions were vile may find less favor, it remains plausible given the record of six such mishaps in that year of 2009, with Martin unmoved to safeguard his domain.\n\nThe thirteenth day of October, as the clock struck five in the evening, brought word to Rich Wayne, a worker of D&D Markets, who told his master, Paul Martin, of the applesauce strewn upon the floor. Martin, wrapped in the trappings of his dinner break, dismissed the warning as he had none other. A quarter hour passed and Mary J. Haddigan, another underling, brought the same news, and again Martin brushed it aside. At half past five, Jennifer Palmer met the floor with a grievous injury. Her fall was the sixth such calamity to mar D&D’s halls in that year alone. She now seeks not just redress for her wounds, but also a reckoning of punitive nature, and the question weighs on whether a motion might bar such a plea.\n\nIn the jurisprudence of California, one may claim punitive recompense for breaches outside the bounds of contract when the wrongdoer is guilty of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So speaks Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a). Malice, as the law would have it, is marked by intent to harm, or lacking such intent, by conduct “despicable” and wrought with “willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the actor, aware of the likely peril of his ways, willfully ignored the chance to avert it. Such was the wisdom of Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the court’s words echoed through the halls of justice.",
            "She had always felt a certain lack, a yearning unquenched, a quiet gnawing at the edge of her being. It began when she was but fourteen, standing on the threshold of a life not yet lived. And still it lingered three years on, at seventeen, an age where the world lay waiting to unfold its mysteries. By then she had come to understand it was not a thing she sought but a someone. Yet no boy had stirred her heart. Some had approached her, stumbling through rituals of courtship with the un-woo-able, but none had kindled the fire within. Often she questioned herself, grappling with the enigma of her own heart, searching for reasons that eluded her grasp. Years of contemplation had yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her musings. So she carried on, her life a tapestry of questions, her desires a riddle unresolved.\n\nA day at home was typically serene, a refuge of calm. Her parents, gentle souls, rarely clashed, their lives a testament to quiet harmony. Arguments with their daughter were rare, a testament to her free spirit and independent nature that occasionally brushed against their tranquil ways. She was the light to their stillness, her vibrant personality a beacon of warmth, her kindness drawing others to her like moths to a flame.\n\nBut today was not such a day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration like a pilgrim seeking grace, the peace was shattered by a scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice cutting through the air like a blade. Panic rising within her, she ran to the source, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, pain written across her face, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" Kneeling beside her, she offered her strength, her touch a balm. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were labored, pressed from her lips by the weight of her suffering. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured weakly, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had honed. She lifted her mother, carried her to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove into the unknown.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a fortress of antiseptic and dread, but her mind was a singular focus, the world narrowed to the task at hand. She carried her mother inside, her voice rising above the din, calling for aid. Faces turned, concern etched in every line, and hands reached out to help, a rolling bed brought forth to bear her mother away. They took her swiftly, and the daughter was left in the echo of her own worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen, a simple slip from a stepping stool while reaching for a vase perched high in the cabinet, an act of grace turned to folly.",
            "In the vast ledger of human endeavor, a study rose from the depths to speak of a thing called the Mediterranean Diet, a name that might hold a promise of heart's deliverance. In its essence, a covenant of sustenance fashioned from the earth's bounty, wherein an alternate Mediterranean score stood, marking one's fidelity to this way of eating, and with it, a whisper of hope against the scourges of chronic heart disease and the shadow of stroke. A diet born of the old soils and sunlit shores, it bade folk to partake more deeply of the plant's gifts, laying aside the heavier fare of beasts. Fruits and nuts, whole grains and legumes, they sang of life, while the monounsaturated riches of olive and fish kept watch over the heart's chambers. A draught of wine was not spurned, for moderation was its own kind of virtue.\n\nThere had been those who came before, chronicling the Med way's virtue against the toll of life and heart, and they spoke of it as one might speak of a balm more soothing than the low-fat creed. Yet the specter of stroke, its sudden and silent visitation, had not been fully reckoned with.\n\nSo it was that this study journeyed alongside 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, whose lives were woven into the Nurses' Health Study, a great tapestry of 121,700 souls strewn across 11 states. From the year 1984 to 2004, six times did the women recount their dietary ways through food frequency reminiscences, a testament to what they had consumed in the year gone by. Most stayed the course, their stories enduring through the years. These accounts were measured against the truth of medical records and the solemnity of death's certificates, seeking the stark reality of heart and stroke. When records slipped from the grasp of certainty, probability held sway, marking 17% of strokes and 24% of heart attacks as likely but unconfirmed. The weight of their bodies, the smoke of their habits, the aspirin in their veins, and the hormones post-menopause were all tallied, alongside the stride of their leisure's exertions.\n\nTo chisel away the noise of fleeting indulgences and uncover the heart of long-term sustenance, the diet scores were averaged over time, like the slow accretion of silt in a riverbed. Adjustments were made for those factors that might cloud the truth, accounting for age and smoke, body and mind, movement and stillness.\n\nThey wielded the tools of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, separating the wheat from the chaff, to discern the link betwixt a Mediterranean way and the specter of heart and stroke. Separate models for the fatal and the nonfatal, each a different path through the dark wood.\n\nAnd so it was found, in this tale of years, that the women who embraced the Mediterranean ways, those in the highest quintile, faced lesser peril from heart's betrayal and stroke's grasp than those who did not. For in 20 years, 2391 cases of heart's onset, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by the heart's and stroke's hand together were chronicled. The top quintile stood with a relative risk, a measure of their lesser fear, at 0.71.\n\nSuch was the tale writ in the annals of science, a story of bread and breath, of olive and vine, and of the enduring hope for heart's reprieve.",
            "The sign stands in the dust and sun, proclaiming a tale of Hitler alive in Burma. Ellen Page, the actress known for the film Juno, stands solitary at a street's edge, her hands lifting a sign of cardboard, the message thereon scrawled in Sharpie, unsettling and stark. Burma, a land also named Myanmar, lies in the heart of Southeast Asia, governed by a ruthless junta that seized its power in the year nineteen sixty-two, a power born of a coup d'état, and held ever since in iron grip. In the year two thousand and seven, the streets bore witness to protests, the first in a decade's time. Led by monks, saffron-robed and resolute, these protests earned their name, \"The Saffron Revolution.\" And the people gathered, their interest piqued by the monks' call, the government at first begrudgingly allowing such gatherings, peaceable as they were. But peace is a fragile thing, and violence brewed like a storm, the military turning against the monks, monasteries torn asunder. Foreign journalists found their freedom forfeit, imprisoned on sight. Among them, a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fell, slain for nothing more than bearing witness to the tumult. Official accounts speak of thirteen dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned from the army's ranks, claimed far more, bodies beyond counting, the toll climbing into the thousands.\n\nSuch is the world's way, the old tale told anew. Atrocities like these are no stranger to the pages of history. The hunger of those in power to stifle dissent, to clutch their rule tight upon the throats of the people, is a tale as ancient as civilization itself. The emperors of Rome, in their marble halls, proclaimed themselves touched by the gods, their power absolute. In Japan, emperors claimed divinity, gods walking among men, guiding them to prosperity, be it through the making of motors or the ritual of hara-kiri. Even now, in the land of the free, George W. Bush, president, speaks each week to Ted Haggard, a voice for foolishness worldwide, a group beneath the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nThe chronicles of history hold many such accounts. The year nineteen eighty-nine saw the protests of June Fourth at Tiananmen Square, where thinkers and laborers and students joined in chorus against the government's iron rule. The numbers of the dead are as uncertain as shadows, from the government's count of a scant few hundred to the Red Cross's claim of thousands. In Rwanda, the nineties bore witness to genocide, the Hutu militias, with government aid, casting a net of death upon the Tutsis, upon any who dared to hold a moderate line, their ethnicity a matter of indifference to the killers. And then, across the years and the lands, Hitler's 'Third Reich' stands as a grim monument, a time and place where Jewish lives were hunted down, extinguished, the world a witness to horror.",
            "In the dim recesses of time and sound, Duke Ellington stands as a figure of enduring grace and vision, his presence in jazz a testament to the long shadow he cast. His hands upon the piano whisper more than they shout, crafting a delicate tapestry where notes hang like stars in the night, each one a testament to his boundless creativity. The orchestra was his canvas, and he painted with the souls of men, drawing out their hidden colors, their secret voices. In the quiet spaces between the notes, you could hear the echoes of something eternal, a music that spoke of the earth and the sky and the spaces in between.\n\nEllington was a master of shaping sound, of bending it to his will, and in his compositions, you could find the space for a man to breathe, to improvise, to find himself in the music. He laid down the bones of the thing and let his players drape it in flesh, each note a heartbeat, each phrase a breath. The orchestra was his choir, and he knew their voices as well as his own, fitting them together like stones in a wall, each one lending its strength to the whole.\n\nIn the pages of the Grove Music dictionary, his name is etched in reverence, a testament to the innovation he brought to the world. Creole Love Call is a song that lives and breathes, a testament to his ability to use the voice as an instrument, weaving it into the fabric of the music until it became one with the whole. In this piece, you hear the echo of a time when music was raw and new, and each note was a step into the unknown.\n\nThe song unfolds in a series of choruses, each one a chapter in a story told without words. The call and response of the first chorus is a conversation between the voice and the reeds, a dialogue that begins in softness and ends in a roughened edge. The muted trumpet of the second chorus speaks in blue notes, a language as old as the earth. The clarinet of the third chorus rises like smoke, the piano a soft heartbeat beneath it. The full band returns in the fourth chorus, echoing the call and response, the brass and reeds in a dance of sound. The fifth chorus climbs to a peak, the reeds in their high register, the brass and rhythm sections a heartbeat beneath. The sixth returns to the beginning, the voice a growl, an instrument in its own right. And in the end, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nHot and Bothered, a year later, is another chapter in this story, a testament to his ear for tone and color. In the call and response between “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, you hear the voice and the instrument as one, a rich tapestry of sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) takes these ideas and stretches them, lets them breathe, the muted trombone of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton a voice in its own right, a melody that dances in the air.\n\nIn Ellington's hands, the music was alive, a living thing that breathed and moved and sang. His legacy is written in the notes that linger in the air, in the echoes that fade into the night, a testament to a man who saw the world in sound and shaped it with his hands.",
            "Why do creatures bend their shapes to the passage of time, twisting and changing as they do? What unseen hands guide the course of their metamorphosis? Though a century has passed since D'Arcy Thompson mused that the zoologist had yet to fathom the simplest of forms with numbers, we stand today only a step beyond his shadow. Yet, there are those who have dared to drape the cloak of mathematics over the slow dance of mollusk bones, tracing their life and lineage in numerical dreams. Our study peers into this enigma, seeking the secret mechanisms behind the evolutionary dance of Prunum, wielding both math and experiment as tools of revelation. We took to the bones of Prunum, captured in their ghostly X-rays, and from these spectral images, we drew the lines of their existence, feeding these measures to the CerioShell. From this sorcery of numbers, we conjured visions of shells that might be, a map of what might lie along the edges of their possible forms. These visions we blend with the raw truth of experiment and observation, grasping for a deeper understanding of the grand play that unfolds in this lineage.\n\nIn the mind's eye, a shell is but a tube bending through the void, each turn a chapter of its silent story. These turns, these whorls, spiral around an invisible spine, the columella, the core of its being. The whorls grow at their own pace, a seam drawing the boundary of each, a suture. The last whorl, the body whorl, is the grand finale, and what came before is the spire, crowned by the apex, the base resting at the opposite end. From the aperture, the creature within reaches out to the world.\n\nA shell reveals itself in many faces: apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The apertural view, the usual face, shows the opening wide, the apex pointing to the heavens.\n\nCounting whorls is a ritual. View the shell from above, find the first suture's birth. With a line, divide the world of the shell, and from this line, count the whorls, each a quarter of the whole.\n\nThink of the shell as a journey of openings across time, as the beast within builds its fortress. We trace this path with the coordinates of the center of each whorl's mouth, charting the course of its growth.\n\nThis path is drawn in lines and numbers. With the formulation in hand, we can play the role of creator, adjusting the threads of the mollusk's bone-making.",
            "In the land of Indonesia, where the sun rises over a tapestry of islands, the cries of newborns and the silence of those who do not survive hold a quiet constancy. For a decade now, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality has lingered in the shadows, unmoved by time's passing. The nation strides forward on paths laid by the Millennium Development Goals, reaching toward the waters and the promise of sanitation. Yet, the road to the health of child and mother remains rugged, the milestones unmet, the journey long. Herein lies the tale of a system in need of fortification, not of isolated remedies.\n\nIn the birthing rooms where life begins, there are changes. A skilled hand is now present in seventy-two percent of births, a mark of progress. But the hands of tradition still hold sway, midwives attending without the tools to quell the bleeding that claims mothers in its sorrowful embrace. The numbers tell a tale half-true, a mirage of progress that fades upon closer view. Elsewhere, the scourge of diarrhea in the young is met with fewer healers, the decline marked in the records of the land. Postnatal care, a flickering concern, is scattered and sparse across the archipelago.\n\nThe knife of the cesarean-section, a lifeline in times of peril, finds its place in the world of the city, but in the countryside, it is a stranger, known to only two percent. The chasm between urban and rural yawns wide, a testament to inequity, a tale of access bound to place. The wealth of the land, too, divides the people; the richest step forward while the poorest stand in shadow, a full twenty-seven percent behind, barred by the cost of care.\n\nAs the nation contemplates the path ahead, the question looms large. Shall the focus narrow to the needs of mother and child, or shall the fabric of the whole be strengthened? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their goals clear and their pace swift. Yet, the cost is a shifting of resources, a neglect of the whole for the part, a tale of divided strength. The lessons of the world echo with warnings, the tale of funds for one disease draining the life from another. As programs multiply, they splinter, uncoordinated, a forest of forms and papers where once there was purpose.\n\nThus, the path forward must be chosen with care, for the lives of the young and their mothers rest upon the decision. The tale of health in Indonesia is a tale of many roads, each leading to a future yet unwritten.",
            "The world of Popular Music has stretched and sprawled over the last century, its branches reaching out into so many genres that one is hard-pressed to name them all. Entangled in its own growth, each genre—be it rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk—has birthed its own progeny, sub-genres and sub-sub-genres spiraling within its confines. If one were to argue, Heavy Metal within the rock sphere has become a most diverse and expressive form of popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive for it lays bare the breadth of human emotion, though it often treads the shadowed path of the spectrum. Its diversity came quick on the heels of its inception, as folk realized its pliability and seized upon it to forge their sub-genres, and onward to sub-sub-genres, a chain unbroken to this day.\n\nNow, here we stand amid the heavy metal movement, a landscape so riddled with niches and enclaves that to define heavy metal is a task fraught with uncertainty. It has absorbed themes from beyond its borders, yet it all began somewhere. To grasp the essence of the metal that pervades the air today, one must first comprehend the very movement of metal, why it is movement and not mere genre.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a movement cloaked in darkness. It is music born of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It offers less of the primitive, more of the skilled; those who play in metal bands are masters of their craft, and their mastery resonates through their sound. Metal too is, though it may surprise none, a movement steeped in the haze of drugs. The psychedelic surge of the mid-seventies drove souls to madness, birthing strange, unearthly records, with drugs as the scapegoat for their creation. It bears many a dark and visceral quality, a novelty in the musical scene where popular tunes often shied from the shadows of the emotional spectrum. Subsequent generations of metal drew from these dark, visceral veins, echoing the Romantic Era's brooding heart. Lyrics such as those penned by Byrne speak to this darkness, foundational to the movement.\n\nThe lines of Helter Skelter reveal the murkier depths of the Beatles. It swings with a rhythm of highs and lows, a reflection, some say, of drug-induced states. This song is heralded by some as among the first of Heavy Metal, a retort to a Rolling Stones track that also treaded heavily and darkly. The Beatles sought to prove their mettle against the Stones, and thus, Helter Skelter found its place on The White Album.",
            "In the time before the surrealists spun their dreams on canvas, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in the world of paint and in the quiet chambers of his heart. The Dream, a painting born in 1910 from Rousseau's hand, offers not just the image of a woman bewitched by the landscapes of her slumber but also stands as a testament to Rousseau's own desires and battles. In his pursuit of acclaim and understanding from the world of art that he so longed to join, he grappled with a choice: to mimic the forms and styles beloved by critics or to carve his own path, stark and solitary. The Dream stands as a mirror to this struggle, reflecting his quest for acceptance against a backdrop of independence.\n\nTo gaze upon The Dream with understanding, one must first walk a little in Rousseau's shoes, to know the life from which his art sprang. Born May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith, a hardware dealer who enjoyed the modest comforts of the bourgeoisie (Shattuck 47). In his youth, art was a stranger to him, for he had no formal schooling in its ways. Instead, he served the state as a gabelou, a toll collector, until he was forty, though he earned the misnomer of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight of their children left him alone save for a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with sorrow (Shattuck 49). It was to painting he turned, seeking solace and a new beginning, untouched by the romantic visions of peasants that his peers often portrayed. He was a folk painter, carrying the dreams and hopes of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the hallowed halls of art is not hard to grasp when seen in the light of his circumstances. He was not only self-taught and late to the canvas but also creating in an era filled with other bright stars. Recognition came slowly, arriving in the shadow of Matisse, who was already making his mark. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon writes of the two as both rivals and contrasts, not just in their art but in the very soul of their painting. Matisse feared the mundane, while Rousseau sought to paint in such a way that he might be welcomed into the ranks of the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers would have you believe in some tether betwixt the good and the beautiful. That one cannot be without the other. And so it may be. As Keats penned on that ancient urn, truth and beauty are a single breath. All we know and all we must ever know. Life teaches us much through its harsh lessons and its brief joys. Yet there are things, ethics and aesthetics among them, that we know without knowing how. They are not learned, but felt. A painting or a poem, a moment of grace or kindness. They are not rules to be followed but things to be understood in the marrow. We try to speak of them, to capture them with words, but words fail. They are shadows on the cave wall.\n\nConsider da Vinci's Mona Lisa. You can talk of its lines and its colors, its place in time, but those words fall short of its truth. Ask someone why they love a painting or a poem and they will tell you there is something about it. Something beyond the reach of words. O'Connor knew well the power of story. A story tells what no statement can. It is not a list of attributes but a doorway. Ethics, too, are such a doorway. Wittgenstein spoke of ethics as beyond the realm of words, a thing transcendent. It is this transcendence, this ineffable quality, that binds art to morality. They are of the same cloth, woven in the shadows.\n\nWe feel the truth of art and ethics in a place beyond the senses. They touch the soul in ways the mind cannot explain. Literature, above all arts, carries this weight. It bears a moral heart that others may not. Music and painting, they have their beauty, but literature holds a mirror to the soul. It reflects our values, the choices we must make. It is vital because it shows us who we are. What we cherish. What we fear. In its pages, we find the truths we cannot speak but only live.",
            "The Germany of today, a land drawn from the depth of its own history, rises like a colossus from the shadowed alps of München to the northern whispers of Kiel by the Baltic sea. This tapestry of culture stretches from Köln along the Rhine, winding through the heart of the country to Dresden's Saxon embrace on the Elbe. Yet beneath this unity lies a story of disparate tribes and origins converging upon a single narrative.\n\nGermania, the ancient soil of the Germans, bears a name shrouded in the mists of scholarly debate. Tacitus penned the tale of the Tungrians, a tribe once bearing the name of Germans, who crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish foes, a tale spun in the year 98. It was Julius Caesar who first carved the word “Germanus” into the annals of history in his writings on the Gallic Wars, demarcating the unconquered Germans from the subdued Gauls. The Gauls, it is said, uttered this name first, a label born of neighborly recognition or perhaps the spear they wielded, the ger, or from the Old Irish garim, the cry of battle echoing through the ages.\n\nTacitus, in his ancient script “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” spoke of the Germans as a people untouched by foreign tides, unmarred by the intermingling of races. He mused on why any soul would forsake the warmth of Asia or Africa, even Italy, for Germany's wild lands, its dour skies, unless it was indeed their home.\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. Their ventures into Germania were for trade, for the spoils of land, and sometimes for conquest, but always they returned to the empire's warm embrace. As the first century unfurled, the Germanic tribes emerged at the empire's edge, trading their earth-born wares and pledging their martial prowess to Rome's legions, weaving their fates into the empire's grand tapestry.

            "In the tale of Twelfth Night, the weave of deception stretches thin across the world like a shadow, and there’s a truth in it that cannot be escaped. That the guise donned for survival might be the very shroud that erases a soul. The danger lies not in the wearing but in the forsaking, for to shed that borrowed skin might leave one standing in a wilderness of solitude. And the choice comes down to the bitter bones of it: to hold onto oneself or to grasp at the threads of connection that fray with the revealing. Faces change like the tides and some may see the trickery with indifferent eyes, yet others will hold it close like a wound, sharp and unforgiving.\n\nThere’s a tangle in the reversal of roles, a question that circles like a hawk. Why does one abandon the self to walk in the skin of another? Viola, the lost wanderer on strange shores, wraps herself in the cloth of manhood, a cloak against the perils that stalk the unknown paths. Her ruse shields her, yet it builds a wall between her and the kinship of women, a gulf that grows with each passing day. She becomes a mirror to the world, reflecting not herself but the desires and confusions of those around her. Olivia, ensnared by the illusion, sees her brother in the face of Cesario and loves what is not there. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) And there too is Orsino, tangled in the net of his own heart, speaking words that bind and unbind. “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nIn the eyes of the now, Twelfth Night reveals the hidden currents beneath the calm waters, the truths that the masks of deception drag to the surface. Olivia and Orsino, each lost in their own reflections, find themselves face to face with the shadows they dared not name. Is it the semblance of manhood that draws Olivia, or is there a deeper truth she cannot see? Perhaps she is but a mirror of the age, a jest of those who see only the surface. For swiftly indeed does Olivia shift her affections to Sebastian, casting aside the illusion of Cesario for the reality of another, finding in Viola not a lover but a sister. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315) And so the play unwinds, revealing the heart of things, the choices made and unmade, in the light of a world that turns on the axis of its own deception.",
            "In the shadowed annals of German dominion, there lies a tale of ruthless governance, one that saw the Ovaherero and Nama people pushed to the brink in the harsh expanse of German South West Africa. Yet to cast the entirety of an empire in so singular a hue is to overlook the variegated tapestry of its rule. The German colonial empire stretched across lands as diverse as its own methods, and within its borders, the matter of education took on many forms. When the British came to claim German East Africa in 1919, they uncovered a landscape peopled by Africans versed in letters and learning. German endeavors in Kamerun and other outposts were likewise acknowledged by the chroniclers of that age.\n\nBut in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, the scene was starkly different. There, unlike the eastern lands where state schools sprouted under government auspices, education for the native populace was left to the missionaries, scantily aided by the state. The state, for its part, poured its efforts into the schooling of Europeans, crafting a network of state institutions and heavily backing the schools run by the missionaries. Such policies cast a long shadow over the land, persisting beyond the end of German rule. While other colonies could claim a populace schooled and literate, South West Africa was left wanting, its people largely untouched by the light of education.\n\nThe divergent path of South West Africa was carved by many hands, social, political, and economic forces all at play. This discourse seeks to unravel those threads, casting light on the settlers’ and officials’ perspectives towards the native peoples. A wealth of knowledge lies within the German chronicles of their empire, penned in a time when the empire itself still stood. These early missives sought to delineate the structure of education within the colonies. Later voices, speaking in English, widened the lens, drawing comparisons and diving deeper into the particulars of each colony’s approach to education. Among these, Cohen’s examination stands out, a study that juxtaposes the educational landscapes of South West and East Africa, attributing much of the former's peculiarity to its sizeable European settler base.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to its sister colonies, was a land of moderate climes, though much of it lay under the sway of desert winds. It was this perceived gentleness that drew Europeans, their numbers swelling to nearly 15,000 by 1913, a stark figure against the 5,336 settlers in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "In the broad expanse of history, there's the tale of two nations, America and Mexico, locked in a struggle that spanned the better part of fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, as set forth by Diehl and Goerts. This tumultuous stretch of time reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846 to 1848, a conflict where the United States set upon Mexico and came away with the vast lands of Texas and the American Southwest. But the war was but a chapter in a long saga of skirmishes, a tale that only found its quietus in the years before the world was consumed by the First Great War. At the heart of this enmity lay a collision of faith, of culture, of the very bones of tradition, a chasm that yawned wide between the two peoples, as Schmitt recounts. \n\nAnd so it is that borders breed such discord, neighbors turned rivals by the soil they share and the interests they contest. America and Mexico, in their quarrel, are but echoes of many such rivalries etched upon the earth. David M. Pletcher speaks to this truth, noting that the thorn of American diplomacy finds its deepest roots only in Mexico and Cuba, nations pressed close by geography and history alike. Yet while others in the Latin lands have found warmth with America, these two stood apart, wrapped in the cloak of rivalry.\n\nReligion carved its own scar upon the land, a familiar story through the ages. Sally Frahm draws the parallel, likening the American aversion in centuries past to Catholicism and monarchy to a later century's disdain for fascism and communism. Ideologies clashed, not in the realm of governance but in the sanctuary of belief, a mistrust birthed from the enmity of English and Spanish forebears and carried forth by their colonial progeny. Such were the seeds sown in the hearts of nations, a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts recount seventeen disputes that marked the fifty-seven-year tapestry of rivalry, most born of the land, border raids, and the lawless fringes of frontier life. Bandits and outlaws haunted these borders, a specter that lingered until the militaries of both nations laid claim to their domains, as Schmitt describes.\n\nYet time, as it does, brought change. Schmitt tells of a shift, a softening, as Mexico's fate became entwined with that of the United States, the rivalry waning as America's gaze turned from conquest to commerce in the waning days of the nineteenth century. Thus, the story of two nations, bound by history, unfurls across the pages of time.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself shackled by a sickness I had not known, a malady creeping in like some unbidden guest in the night. I had been a nurse then, my hands accustomed to the work, drawn to the trade by the promise of safety, a security that eluded my youth. The words echoed in my mind, a refrain learned in the tender years of growing: \"You'll always find work; folks'll always fall ill.\" So it was that my dreams of science and the pen were set aside, and nursing claimed me.\n\nYet, there I stood, forty-six, unwed, pockets bare, unable to ply my trade. Still now, after a span of fifteen years, I remain ensnared by that which left me, a mendicant upon the mercy of Social Security, all that was once mine now scattered like leaves before the wind. Each day meets me with struggle, an affront to the fragile bastions of safety and esteem. Certainty's light is dim, yet one truth abides steadfast: without kin and a handful of steadfast companions, I would have been lost to the years, my strength a pale shadow against the tempest of disaster.\n\nIn life, there are storms and calms, and no prescience can guard against the tempests too vast for one soul to withstand. It is folly to place faith solely in the faltering machinery of government, worn and weary as it is. Instead, let us turn to one another, to the bonds forged in trust and aid, rather than retreat to the solitude of backyard bunkers.\n\nThe lore of rugged individualism is sung by some, yet it was not alone that our forebears weathered the harshness. It was compassion and respect, the pooling of what scant resources they had, that saw them through. Those who journeyed westward in their wagon trains did not reach the distant shore by solitary endeavor.\n\nPrepare, by all means. I do. A kit against disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to purify water, and sheeting with tape to seal against unseen threats. Torches and their batteries, candles aplenty and matches that will not fail, stores of food in tins. If you have the land for it, let it yield its bounty, preserve what you can, and set a stove to warm you. But do not dwell in isolation.\n\nSeek out your neighbors. Know them.",
            "In an age lost to the mists of time, in the shadowed dawn of the fifth or sixth century before the Christ, there was born a prince who would one day cast off the trappings of his birthright, to wander the earth beneath the name of Buddha. Through the long arc of his life, he turned from the world and found enlightenment, and the echoes of his teachings would swell to form the river of Buddhism. The ancient current of it now bears the name Theravada, the oldest stream of those waters. Two thousand five hundred years of time have worn the edges of its doctrine, and what was once is not as it now appears. From the temples of Sri Lanka, the yearly rite of the water-cutting ceremony unfolds, a spectacle of devotion that Buddha himself never spoke of. Yet its absence in the old teachings does not diminish its place among the faithful. The changes, they run deep as they run wide, from the rituals of the surface to the very marrow of the soteriological bones of the faith. Theravada Buddhists, both the robed monks and the layfolk that follow, have bent and swayed under the weight of time, reshaping their beliefs in the face of forces seen and unseen, friend and foe alike.\n\nThere are words and terms that will shape this telling as we step into the shadows cast by these forces. There is the notion of the internal and the external. An internal force, born within the Buddhasasana, speaks with the voice of its own, whether monk or lay disciple. The external force breathes from beyond, a stranger’s breath. Hostile forces, like a storm, seek to rend and break, born of an eye turned cold upon the faith. Yet benign forces walk a different path, indifferent yet leaving their mark as they pass. These words will thread through the tale we tell.\n\nTo begin, we peer into the heart of the faith, the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the sacred text, holds the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka guards the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka lays down the law, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka unravels the mysteries of being. In these pages, words like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca whisper truths of no soul, suffering, and impermanence. To know them is to end Sansara, the wheel of rebirth that spins eternal. With its halt comes the end of desire, hatred, and delusion when enlightenment smiles upon the soul. The Vinaya Pitaka speaks of conduct, five precepts for the layman: to harm not, to lie not, to steal not, to stray not in desire, to cloud not the mind with drink. For the monks, the path is narrower, bound by many more rules. Yet at the heart of it all rests the four noble truths: life is suffering, for suffering is born of attachment, and yet, it can be overcome."
