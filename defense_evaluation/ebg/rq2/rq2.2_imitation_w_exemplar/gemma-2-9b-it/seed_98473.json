            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The road ahead lay dust-grey and bare. The sun, a pale eye in the ashen sky, offered no comfort. A life in service to others had always called to him, a pull as insistent as the wind across the barren plains. It wasn't a path laid out clear, more a slow burn in the soul, a knowing. He'd seen the cracks in the world, the ways folks tried to patch them with lies and denials. A Bachelors in Psychology, a degree meant to unravel the knots in the human mind, had given him a glimpse, but not the answers. Then came the boy, a shadow perched on a friend's couch, his eyes haunted by things too heavy for sixteen years to bear. A family shattered, a system indifferent. It was a silent plea, a cry for the kind of help that went beyond the law, beyond the cold logic of statutes.  \n\nHe saw the desperation in the parents' eyes, the way they twisted the truth, the way they wore their own pain like a shield. The boy needed more than words, he needed a hand, a steady presence in the storm. That day, the road called him towards service, towards a fight against the shadows that gnawed at the edges of humanity.\n\nThe world, he knew, held a strange contradiction. It mourned the lost, yet clung to conformity, a fear of the individual blooming like a weed in the cracks of society.  He saw injustice, the kind that suffocated the spirit, the kind that whispered to the broken. He fought it in his own way, a splash of color against the monotone, a voice raised in defiance. GSBA, piercings, a refusal to be molded into the expected shape. It was a silent rebellion, a testament to the value of the unique, the individual.\n\nSocial work, he realized, was more than a profession, it was a calling. A chance to mend the fractured world, to be a witness to the pain and the resilience of the human spirit. It was a road paved with challenges, but he walked it with a heart open to the struggle, to the fight for justice, and to the quiet dignity of those who dared to be different.",

Baclofen, a whisper of a name, a chemical promise of rest.  The mice, models, reflections.  Could their slumber hold a key to our own?\n\nBut the night is vast, and the body is but a fragment.  The world outside, a tapestry woven with threads of circumstance.  Sociocultural, they call it.  Race, ethnicity, the ghosts of history clinging to the soul.  Socioeconomic status, a chasm that yawns wide, a barrier to restful nights.\n\nThey study these things, seeking patterns in the chaos.  A thread here, a shadow there.

            "The play Twelfth Night speaks of a truth, veiled though it may be: that disguise, while it can serve as a cloak for deception,  can also become a shroud, swallowing the self whole. It's a dangerous game, this shedding of skin, for in revealing the truth, one risks tearing at the bonds of those around them. Some may accept the mask fell, others will recoil, the charade a stain upon their trust. This truth is magnified when the disguise takes on the form of gender, a delicate dance between self and other, a question of who one is beneath the surface.\n\nWhy does one choose to abandon their true self, to wear the garments of another? In Viola's case, it is a question of survival, a desperate act of self-preservation in a world that can be cruel to the vulnerable. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). But this shield, this borrowed armor, isolates her from the solace of her own kind, leaving her adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the deception deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own making. Olivia, drawn to the fabricated Cesario, finds herself entangled in a web of mistaken affections. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). The mask not only shields, it distorts, leading to a love born of illusion.  \n\nThis play, a tapestry woven with intricate threads of deception, also probes the depths of unspoken desires, exposed by the veil of Viola's disguise. Does Olivia's longing for Cesario stem from a fascination with the male form, or does it hint at a deeper yearning, a secret impulse buried beneath the societal constraints of her time? And what of Orsino? His words, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261), echo with a yearning that seems to find its voice only through the lens of Viola's perceived masculinity. \n\nTwelfth Night, then, becomes a mirror held up to the human heart, reflecting the complexities of identity, desire, and the perilous consequences of playing a role. It asks us to confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the most dangerous masks are the ones we wear to protect ourselves, for in hiding our true selves, we risk losing ourselves entirely.",
            "The dust of the empire clung to everything. A fine gray powder that settled on the tongues of men and the pages of forgotten books. German rule, they called it. A name that tasted like iron and ash in the mouth.  The stories they told, they spoke of a cruelty that carved its mark on the land itself. The Ovaherero and Nama, they said, were swept away like leaves in a windstorm, their bones bleached white in the sun. But the wind, it whispers its secrets in many tongues. The empire was a vast and shifting thing, a tapestry woven from threads of darkness and light. \n\nThey spoke of schools in the east, of tongues loosened and minds opened. Children, eyes bright with the promise of knowledge, learning the language of the conquerors, learning the ways of the world beyond the savanna. But here, in the west, a different song played out. A song of silence and shadow. The missionaries, they came with their Bibles and their hymns, their voices echoing hollowly in the empty plains. The government, it turned a blind eye, turning its back on the silent pleas of a people yearning for light. \n\nThe sun beat down on the cracked earth, baking the bones of the forgotten. The children, they were left to wander in the wasteland of ignorance, their voices unheard, their futures unwritten. A gulf yawned between them and the world that lay beyond the horizon. On one side, the educated, the privileged, the inheritors of a distant empire. On the other, the forgotten, the silenced, the prisoners of their own forsaken land.",
            "The music they called popular, well it’s spread out thin these days. A hundred years and more, and they got so many names for it, so many boxes to put it in, you couldn’t count them all. Rap and rock, country and jazz, folk – each one a whole forest of branches and sub-branches, and undergrowth you might not even see. But it’s heavy music that’s taken root deepest.\n\nHeavy metal. That’s the sound of the storm clouds gathering. It’s been forty years and more, and it keeps growing, branching out, becoming something new. It’s dark, sure, and that's where its power lies. It digs down deep, to the roots of things, the fears and the anger and the things we try to keep buried.  \n\nBut it ain’t just dark. It’s alive. It’s got a fire in it, a hunger. The musicians, they know their tools, they know how to make that sound scream and howl and shake the ground. And it’s a language, too, a language of feeling, of rage, of sorrow, of something wild and untamed.\n\nIt’s hard to say where it all began, this metal storm. But it’s a movement, see? It ain’t just a genre, it’s a thing that takes hold of you, a force that carries you along.\n\n It’s got drugs in its veins, this metal. It’s got the seventies haze, the chemical sunsets. It’s got the ghosts of Romantics, too, the ones who saw beauty in the darkness. \n\nListen: [He’d quote those lyrics, the ones about Helter Skelter and the madness, the spiraling down, the darkness.] That’s where it all starts. The Beatles, they knew. They took a dark turn, a dangerous turn, and showed the world what was possible.",
            "The man in the straw hat, Henri Rousseau, he called himself. A gabelou, they said. A toll collector. But in the quiet hours, he dreamt. Dreams of lush jungles, of staring eyes and tigers with stripes like flames. Dreams of a world seen not with the eyes of the day, but through the lens of the mind. A world where the canvas bled with color and the brush sang a song of its own. \n\nHe dreamt of acceptance. Of the whispers in darkened galleries, the murmurs of praise. Of men in frock coats and ladies in velvet gowns, their faces awash in the lamplight, nodding their approval. But the world he knew was a different thing. A world of grey streets and the sharp smell of soot. A world where art was a matter of brushstrokes and technique, of blending and shading, of mimicking the masters.  \n\nHis canvas, it called to him. It begged for the colors of his dreams. But the fear lingered, a shadow in the corners of his mind. Could he, a man who had never known the comfort of a master's hand, dare to paint outside the lines? To carve his own path, to stand alone in the cacophony of the art world?\n\nHe was restless, this Rousseau. He yearned for the recognition, the validation.  But he also felt the pull of his own vision, the whispers of the dreams that danced behind his eyes. To paint as he saw, not as they expected. To be the artist he was meant to be, even if it meant standing apart.\n\nHe lived with this conflict, this internal struggle. A tight knot in his chest, a question mark hanging in the air.  The Dream, they called it. But for him, it was more than a painting. It was a reflection of his soul, a battleground where the artist and the man clashed.  Could he find peace? Could he bridge the gap between his yearning for approval and his burning desire to be true to himself? \n\nOnly time, and the stroke of the brush, would tell.",
            "The line they whisper, the thinkers, about the ties that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty.  It ain't no accident.  Like Keats saw it, beauty, truth, all you need to know.  We cram knowledge down our throats, facts and figures, stories learned by rote. But beauty, goodness, that ain't no lesson.  We stumble into it, feel it in the hollows of our bones. \n\nWe dissect art, break down morals, try to find the formula, the blueprint.  We talk about brushstrokes, composition, right and wrong.  But that ain't it, not the heart of it. You can't boil down the Mona Lisa to ratios and perspective.  When someone says, \"There's just something about it,\" they're closer to the truth. A story, like O'Connor said, is a way to say what words can't, what logic can't touch. There's a space left over, a silence that sings. \n\nIt's like that with ethics too. Wittgenstein, he knew it. You can't capture it, pin it down. Ethics is beyond words, a wind you feel on your face, a cold stone in your gut.  \n\nArt and morality, they both reach for something beyond the known, something that hums in the dark corners of the soul. Literature, it's got that most of all, the way it lays bare the heart's darkness and its light.  It's about values, McKean said, the things that make a life worth living, worth fighting for.  And maybe that's where the truth lies, in the shared space between these two mysteries, where reason falters and the soul speaks.",
            "The echo of Germany hangs heavy, a land forged in the fires of history. From the shadowed peaks of München to the salt-laced winds of Kiel, a singular spirit runs deep. It spills from the cobbled streets of Köln, whispers in the wind that sweeps through Dresden, a city carved out of stone and memory on the banks of the Elbe.  \n\nBut this Germany, this land of song and shadow, wasn't born whole. It rose from the dust of countless tribes, their whispers lost to time but their bones woven into the fabric of the land. \n\nGermania, the ancient cradle of the German people, a name shrouded in the fog of history. Tacitus, the Roman chronicler, traced its roots to the Tungrians, a tribe that, he claimed, crossed the Rhine, leaving behind the ghosts of their former selves to wage war against the Gauls. Caesar, the architect of empires, first wielded the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of conquest. A label, perhaps, born out of necessity, to distinguish the conquered from the unconquered. He borrowed it from the Gauls themselves, a whispered word that carried the weight of their fear and their respect. \n\nBut the whispers persist. Some say the name germinated from the spear they wielded, the \"ger,\" a weapon etched in blood and courage. Others, that it sprang from the guttural cry of \"garim,\" the Old Irish word for \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the battlefields. \n\nTacitus, in his desolate masterpiece, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched, unmarred by the stain of foreign blood. He saw them as the sons and daughters of the earth, their roots running deep into the very heart of the land. \n\nBut Rome, ever hungry, ever reaching, sent its legions to the borders of Germania. They came for gold, for slaves, for plunder, leaving behind a trail of devastation in their wake. The Germans, however, were not easily subdued. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills, and even fought for Rome, their swords stained with the blood of both friend and foe.\n\nThe story of Germany is a tapestry woven from threads of conquest and resistance, a symphony of clashing cultures, a testament to the enduring spirit of a people who refused to be silenced.",
            "The bowl stared back. A brown stain against the white porcelain, a silent accusation. I looked into it, not seeing the water, the grime, the rot, but the emptiness behind it. A black hole in the world. Thoughts, useless, flitting things, danced on the edge of my mind. Like flies around a carcass. I wanted to shut them out, to feel nothing. But the feeling wouldn't come. Just the cold weight of it, the knowledge that this was where it all ended. This mundane act, this public defilement. \n\nThe artist I knew once talked about seeing the world in frames, simplifying it to its barest elements. A bowl of fruit, a face, a landscape reduced to its essence. But the frame wouldn't come. My mind was a tangled thicket, the brush strokes of life messy and uncontrolled. Picasso, Monet, Renaissance masters – they all had their colors, their stories. What color would my story be? Brown. The color of decay, of shit. \n\nMy hand, a glove of flesh and bone, reached for the handle of the toilet brush. It felt familiar, almost comforting in its ordinariness. But the purpose, the act itself, was obscene. The water swirled, a meaningless dance of futility.  Each flush a futile attempt to erase what couldn't be erased. The brown stain remained, a stubborn monument to my own insignificance.",
            "The road stretches out, a ribbon of black against the dust. It speaks of nowhere in particular, just the endless miles of it. And on that road, young lives are lost. Like fireflies extinguished too soon. \n\nThey say the boy's brain ain't ready. Not for the weight of the wheel, the cold grip of the brake. A science thing, they say. Like the moon landing. But the truth of it is older than science. It's the hunger in their eyes, the recklessness that sings in their blood. The need to feel alive, even if it means dancing with death.\n\nThey pile in, these young ones, their laughter ringing like shattered glass. Two or three in a car, more if they can squeeze. Backseats bursting, limbs tangled, the air thick with the scent of freedom and fear. And somewhere in that tangle, a skull cracks, a heart stops.  \n\nThey try to cage them, these young birds. Temporary licenses, they call them. Hours of driving, restrictions on passengers. But the cage can't hold the wildness. The need to fly.\n\nThe old man knows. He remembers his own youth, the hunger in his veins. He remembers the thrill of the open road, the wind whipping through his hair.  It's a feeling that stays with you, even when you're old and gray. \n\nBut the world has changed. The roads are harder, the drivers more desperate. The shadows are longer, the darkness deeper. Even the stars have lost their shine.\n\nThis is a slow burn, this tragedy unfolding. A slow and terrible fire that consumes the young. But it's a fire that can be stopped. The old man knows this. We can build a wall, a fortress of law and order. We can keep them safe, for a while, at least. But the hunger will always be there. The need to fly. And someday, it will break free.",
            "The Library of Congress, a mausoleum of forgotten things, held a cache of Edison’s early films. Fifteen trick films, they called them, from the twilight years of the 19th century to the dawn of the 20th. Illusions spun from the darkroom, conjured by the twitch of a lever, the sleight of a hand in the flickering light.  My study, a pilgrimage through these shadows, sought to unravel the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the faint echo of innovation in a few that dared to stray.\n\nThe trick film, in its prime, was a thing of constraint. Bound by the stage, a proscenium frame its prison, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile and watching. Long shots, medium shots, these were the tools of the trade. Close-ups, a language yet to be spoken, were absent. No movement of the camera to follow the dance of figures, only a static tableau, a glimpse into a world frozen in time. \n\nLike Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors would shuffle across the stage, a ghostly procession, confined to the horizontal plane. They would vanish from view, but the camera remained indifferent, its gaze unwavering.\n\nThis stage-bound world, inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville, from the whispers of magic, demanded a certain kind of illusion.  Actors moved side to side, never forward or back. The audience, like the camera, was a passive observer, privy to a world that existed only within the confines of the frame.\n\nOne concept, one shot. This was the mantra of the trick film. A minute, a fleeting moment captured in the blink of an eye. The narrative, if there was one, was a whisper, a ghost story told in shadows and smoke, a fleeting glimpse into the impossible. \n\nBut even within these constraints, there were whispers of rebellion. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a film seemingly single-shot in its entirety, a closer examination reveals a subtle shift. The moment where Mary’s severed “head” appears, a brief flicker in the darkness, betrays the illusion. The single shot is a composite, a carefully constructed lie woven from multiple threads of truth.",
            "The dust of Caroline clung to John Taylor like the memory of a fallen summer. A man of the soil, his hands calloused from the tilling, his mind shaped by the rhythm of the seasons. He believed in the honest sweat of the land, in the quiet dignity of a man who worked with his own two hands.  That belief was the bedrock of his politics, a stubborn insistence on freedom, on a government that served the farmer, not the other way around.\n\nHe saw in the newborn nation a rare chance, a blank slate upon which to etch a society fit for men of substance, men who understood the value of self-reliance.  He spoke of natural rights, of a web woven tight, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole.  He feared the city, the whispers of men who sought power, who saw in weakness a chance for gain.  He remembered the stories of old, of kings and emperors, of how men with ambition devoured the land and the people.  This, he swore, would not be their way.\n\nHe saw the truth in the duality of man, in the good and the bad that warred within every heart.  A government, he argued, had to be built to reflect that truth, to hold the darkness at bay while nurturing the light.  He spoke of principles, of the sanctity of property, the vital importance of the farm, the need to resist the siren song of unchecked wealth.   He believed that even the best intentions could be corrupted, that power, once tasted, could turn bitter.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution, a believer in its letter and its spirit, a champion of limited government.  He saw the danger in a sprawling federal machine, in its reach for power beyond its mandate.  He held the Declaration of Independence close, its words a beacon, reminding them that the nation was built on the idea of sovereign states, united yet free.\n\nHe was John Taylor of Caroline, a farmer, a politician, a man who believed in the power of the land, the strength of the individual, and the fragility of freedom. And he would fight, with every fiber of his being, to protect it.",
            "The fall turned hard. Submissions, they dipped down like a stone in the river. Figure 17, third month. Figure seventeen, a cold wind whistling through the bones. Couldn't say why. Winter, it grips you tight in these parts. Less folk walking, less bikes. December, a time for books and grades, for the closing of one year and the start of another. The holidays, they come like a shroud, swallowing everything whole. No need to come to the campus then. January, too, a slate wiped clean, a new semester. Then February. Still hollow.\n\nMaybe it's the way of things. A fire, it burns bright at first, then the embers fade. We tried to stoke the flames, a Carpool Challenge Week in March. A flurry of activity, a burst of light. Helped, for a time. But the urge to drive, it's in our blood, a deep vein in this country. You gotta offer something, something to make them leave the iron horse behind.\n\nWe gave out trinkets, gift certificates, tokens. Coffee, food, massage. A few stores, a few names. But what if we'd offered something bigger? A bicycle, maybe. A car, new, silent, clean. Would that have changed things? Would it have pulled them back from the road?\n\nThe prizes, they stayed the same. But imagine, a whisper in December, a promise of steel and rubber in January. Would it have made a difference?",
            "The road ate at the world, a black ribbon slithering through the ash and bone. An ETF, they called it, a cage for your money, a promise of a return on the chips you gambled with.  Like a stock, they said, but quicker, slicker, a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It tracked an index, a shadow of what was, a ghost of the market's past.  Diversification, they called it, spreading your bread crumbs across a barren landscape.  But at what cost?\n\nThey talked of low expense ratios, a whisper of salvation in the wind.  But the commission, the bite taken from your winnings, that was real.  And they offered you a choice, a single share, a piece of the pie, but was it a whole pie or just a crust?\n\nHe sat in the dust, a crow picking at the carcass of his thoughts.  He had heard their promises, tasted the honeyed words, but the stench of ashes lingered.  He looked at the ten stocks, the backbone of the ETF, the pillars of this paper kingdom.  They held the keys, these companies, to the gatekeeper's vault.  But were they truly the gatekeepers, or just the locked doors?\n\nHe had seen the charts, the graphs, the numbers dancing in the moonlight.  They whispered of a higher return, a lower risk, a path to salvation.  But he knew, deep down, that the market was a beast, a hungry monster that craved blood.  And the only blood it cared for was yours.\n\nHe would study the numbers, dissect them, tear them apart.  He would find the truth, the hidden cost, the hidden benefit.  He would know.\n\nHe had to.",
            "The word “Thulé,” a shadow from some old, cold world, hangs in the air of Poe’s “Dream-Land.”  It echoes back from Virgil, a whisper across the centuries, a place beyond the known, an island swallowed by the grey mist of the north. But there’s another ghost in this poem, a specter closer to home, a German shadow cast upon this American dream. Goethe. \n\nArndt, that scholar of the shadowed world, sees the kinship between Poe’s “Dream-Land” and Goethe’s “Faust,” a phantom hand reaching across the sea. The King in “The King of Thulé,” a man broken by grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, his eyes fixed on the endless horizon. The King in “Dream-Land,” haunted by the shades of the past, his own kingdom a wasteland of ash and sorrow. A doppelganger, perhaps, born of loss and the solace of the bottle.\n\nGoethe’s “Faust” itself a dark tapestry woven with threads of despair and longing, a tale of ambition and damnation, a man who bargains with the devil for knowledge and power. And Poe, steeped in the melancholic beauty of German Romanticism, draws upon this wellspring of darkness, shaping his own vision of a world where dreams are fragile and shadows stretch long.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land” is a poem of echoes and whispers, of a world both familiar and strange. And in the heart of it lies the ghost of a German king, a reminder that even in the darkness, beauty and sorrow are inextricably entwined.",
            "The applesauce lay slick and yellow on the linoleum, a stain against the sterile white of the D&D market aisle. A hazard, a precipice of sticky death. Jennifer Palmer knew this. She knew it in the way a man knows the bite of winter, the way a woman knows the ache of a lost child. It had been a half hour, a lifetime in the slow crawl of the late afternoon. Twice the warning had been given, twice the manager, Martin, had turned a deaf ear. Dinner, he'd said. No time for complaints. \n\nThis wasn't the first time. Not by a long shot. Five other souls had fallen victim to this same treacherous path in 2009 alone. But Martin, he wasn't listening. Not to the whispers of the floor, not to the cries of the fallen, not to the gnawing fear in the pit of Palmer's own stomach.  \n\nAnd now, she was down. The world tilted, a kaleidoscope of pain blooming in her back. The applesauce, a sticky monument to negligence, clung to her like a shroud.\n\nThe law, it was a fickle thing. But malice, that was a different beast entirely.  It was a darkness in the heart, a cold indifference to the suffering of others.  Could a judge see it in Martin's eyes?  Would he understand the weight of those unanswered pleas, the calculated disregard for human safety?\n\nPalmer, she knew she had a story to tell. A story of a spilled apple sauce, a manager's indifference, and a back broken by a disregard for human life.  A story that might just demand retribution.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, the dust of some old fire still clinging to the world.  Four years back, in a classroom lit by the cold glow of fluorescent tubes, I wrestled with the question of Islam, a question that seemed to fester, to grow more urgent with each passing day. Was this faith, this creed, inherently hostile? The news, a crow cawing in the wind, had shifted its tune since the towers fell. From a cacophony of fear to a hushed reverence.  Could a man like Barack Obama, a name like that, a whisper of 'foreign' blood in his veins, have dared to dream of the presidency back then?\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, a tangled web of contradictions. I'd always thought of him as a warlord, a man who carved his empire with a sword and the lash of iron. But this account, this biography, painted a different picture. A martyr, misunderstood, a man who wore humility like a shroud. They said he didn't force their hands, didn't break their spirits, but simply spoke his truth, and truth, like a slow-burning fire, consumed the hearts of men.\n\nAnd then there was the echo, the chilling similarity between the ministries of Jesus and this man, Muhammad. The feeding of the multitude, a simple act of sharing, a loaf of bread multiplied, enough to sate forty hungry souls. It was a cadence, a refrain, a theft of the divine, a whispering echo in the wilderness. \n\nThe stories, they danced around their purpose. Distant voices, whispers passing from man to man, each retelling blurring the line between truth and fable. Proof, they claimed, but the echo of doubt lingered. \n\nNo, what truly gnawed at me was the elevation, the attempt to cast Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of gentleness and wisdom. But history, a weathered stone, whispered a different tale.  Did those who followed him, those who swore their allegiance, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The boy squinted at the dust-filled air, the sun a pale disc in the sky.  He’d heard whispers of a time before the ash, before the wind carried the memory of fire. A time when the green things grew tall and the rivers ran clear. He’d seen the pictures, faded and cracked, in his father’s worn book.\n\n“Was it always like this?” he asked.\n\nHis father didn’t answer. They walked on, their boots crunching on the gravel road, the silence a shroud around them. The world had chewed itself up and spat out its bones.  The churches stood empty, their stained glass windows shattered, the silence inside thick with the dust of forgotten prayers.\n\nHe’d seen the signs, the fading scriptures on the peeling walls, the remnants of a faith swallowed by the dust.  He’d heard the stories, the whispers of a man who preached love and forgiveness, a man whose words had once burned bright. But the fire had died, leaving only ashes and cinders.\n\nThey walked on, the road stretching before them like a ribbon unwinding into the greyness. The boy coughed, a dry, rattling sound in the stillness.\n\n“Did he even exist?” he asked, his voice barely a murmur.\n\nHis father stopped, his gaze fixed on the horizon. He didn’t turn, didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, he said, “Some things are buried too deep to know for sure.” \n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. “But the questions,” he said, “the questions are all that’s left.”",
            "The smoke hung low, a greasy shroud over the city. Buildings, black against the dying light, stood like sentinels of greed.  Inside, the machinery churned, a beast of iron and steam fueled by the sweat and sorrow of men.  These men, they were cogs in a machine they could not comprehend, driven by the relentless hunger for profit.  The owners, their faces turned away from the grime and despair, saw only numbers, felt only the echo of profit in their hearts.\n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving, of a corrupt heart.  The line of buildings, \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" speaks of a world consumed by darkness.  The smoke, \"streaming away to the end of the world,\" is a symbol of the endless consumption, the insatiable appetite that devours all in its path.  The river of grime and waste, the stench of animal death, the shadows of men working themselves to bone-thin frames – all a testament to the heartlessness at the core of this system.\n\nThey worked in those factories, these men, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed.  A dollar, a meager wage, was all that stood between them and starvation.  Loyalty?  Decency?  These were words lost in the clamor of the machines, drowned out by the relentless churn of the gears. Sinclair lays bare their plight: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThere was no safety net, no solace in the face of this injustice.  The laws, if they existed at all, were mere whispers in the face of such overwhelming power.  Unions, meant to offer a shield, became another cog in the machine, siphoning off the meager earnings of the workers they were supposed to protect.\n\nThe men were slaves, bound not by chains but by circumstance, their lives a constant struggle for survival.  Sinclair's words, sharp and unflinching, echo the despair: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The light fades slow in these parts. A thin, gray light, like the leavings of a dream. Fitzgerald builds his world this way, with colors that whisper and bleed into one another. White and gray, they hang heavy, like the dust on a forgotten porch. He starts with them, these colors, laying them down like foundations. White for the shimmer of things, for the surface of things, the niceties.  Gray for the bone beneath, for the weight of time, the fading.  \n\nHe paints Daisy in white, a white girlhood worn like a shroud, a white dress catching the light, a white roadster slicing through the dusty air.  And Jordan too, draped in white, a wisp of smoke against the gray backdrop of the world. They move through the world in these shades, like ghosts themselves, their lives a blur of surfaces. \n\nBut Fitzgerald, he knows the truth. He sees the grayness beneath the white, the emptiness at the heart of things. He shows us the gray of Gatsby's parties, the gray names on Nick's list, the gray cars rolling through the valley of ashes. The gray of the world that stretches out, endless and unyielding.  \n\nAnd then, when you think you've seen it all, he brings in the reds and pinks. A splash of color against the drabness, a promise of something more. A red light, a flicker of life. But these are fleeting things, shadows in the twilight. They fade as quickly as they appear, leaving behind only the gray.",
            "The sun beat down on San Diego, a constant, brassy presence. It coaxed the land to yield its bounty: tomatoes fat and red, citrus bursting with juice, greens that whispered of spring, squash the color of bone, broccoli heads tight and promising. Herbs, pungent and alive, filled the air with their sharp perfume. Peaches and lemons hung heavy on the trees, berries blushed beneath the leaves, bees hummed a lazy tune over the blossoms. Honey dripped from the combs, peppers glowed like fire in the sun. This was a land of plenty, a land where life pushed forth with a relentless, stubborn grace.\n\nBut beyond the bounty, there was a whisper, a yearning for something more. A hunger for a connection deeper than the earth's yield, a longing for a purity that transcended the market's call.  In this land of plenty, people craved the taste of something truer, something cleansed of the world's taint.\n\nThey sought it in the bounty of the soil, in the eggs laid by hens that scratched in the sun-baked earth, in the milk that flowed from contented cows, their bells a soft chime in the stillness.  They sought it in the whispers of the wind through the fields, in the rustle of leaves, in the quiet sigh of a faraway river. They sought it in the small, quiet farms that dotted the landscape, where the earth was treated with reverence, where the cycle of life and death was understood, not feared. \n\nThese were the farms where the land was not just a source of profit, but a place of healing, a place of connection. They were gardens of life, nurtured by sweat and prayer, where the soul found solace in the rhythm of the seasons. And in these gardens, the spirits of the earth whispered back, promising a harvest richer than any gold.  \n\nThis was the promise that drew people to these places, to the small farms tucked away in the valleys, where the air was thick with the scent of rosemary and thyme. They came seeking a connection, a touch of the wild, a taste of something real.",

Not a thing, not a place, but a ghost that clung to men, to their bones. A hollow echo in the silence. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating - that's a fool's game. A firefly dancing in the dark. What good is knowing what a man *is* if you don't know what he *holds* dear?\n\nWhen you walk into a stranger's world, you carry your own shadows with you. Your own beliefs, your own burdens, and the world you see is a fractured reflection of that. To truly understand, you must lay down your own ghosts, look past the surface, see the bones beneath the skin. Look into the eyes, not for truth, but for the tremor of fear, the flicker of hope.\n\nCulture, it ain't just lines drawn on a map. It's the slow, steady thrum of the heart in a crowded room. It's the unspoken rules, the tight-lipped smiles, the way a hand touches another in a moment of unspoken understanding. It's the ghosts of a thousand years, whispering in the halls of your mind.\n\nAnd there's the corporate ghost, too. The office walls, the suits, the unspoken codes of conduct. A company can be a kingdom unto itself, with its own laws, its own values, its own hunger. Some hunger for profit, others for power, others for something more elusive, something they can't even name.\n\nValues, now those are the marrow of the bone. They tell you why a man fights, why he bends, why he breaks. What he holds dear, what he fears. A culture that prizes harmony will shy from conflict, while a culture that reveres the deal will see no shame in hard bargaining.\n\nBut remember, a negotiator can't just stare at the map and expect to find the treasure. He must listen to the wind, feel the earth beneath his feet, and look into the eyes of his opponent. For in those eyes, he might glimpse not just a face, but a soul. A soul that echoes with the stories of a thousand generations, a soul that holds the key to the heart of the matter.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” These words, taken from Psalm 14 of the scriptures, echo in the chambers of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the understanding of God’s existence.  Like Aquinas, who follows in his wake, they both wrestle with the same concept, seeking to prove the God of the Bible. To compare them fairly, we must assume their God is one and the same, a singular being, unchanging and immutable.  And yet, though both men offer compelling arguments, neither truly lays bare a wholeness in their defense.  They glimpse the truth, but the full picture remains elusive.\n\nAnselm’s argument is a journey inward, a quest for God within the depths of the soul.  He posits that because God exists within our understanding, his nonexistence is nonsensical. The proof, he suggests, lies not in the world without, but in the knowing that resides within. This reliance on faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be empirically proven, is a cornerstone of Christian belief.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, lays his foundation in reason and observation. He constructs a case for God’s existence based on five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument weaves a tapestry of logic, suggesting that the very fabric of existence points towards a necessary first cause, a God whose absence leaves gaping holes in the universe.  His approach, if successful, would provide a powerful tool for evangelism, a bridge to the faithful through the clarity of reason alone.\n\nBut both men, in their pursuit of the divine, leave us wanting. They offer fragments of the puzzle, but the full image remains obscured. The question lingers: is the proof of God to be found in the whispers of the soul or in the cold calculus of logic? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the space between, a place where faith and reason intertwine, where the heart and the mind find common ground.",
            "The boy was born into the world sometime in the past, a prince they called Buddha. He wandered, searching, and in the end, he found silence in the heart of things. His words, they whispered down through the years, became the path, the Theravada way. It’s been a long time now, over two thousand autumns, and the path has forked, grown tangled in the woods. \n\nTake that island, Sri Lanka, a place where the sea winds sigh and the rain washes clean the bones of the earth. There, they still hold the water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of the old ways. Monks and the common folk alike gather, offering prayers and blessings to the river. A strange thing, this ceremony, for the boy who found enlightenment never spoke of such things.\n\nThese are the echoes of change, whispers in the wind. The path, it shifts, the stones beneath the feet rearranged by unseen hands. From the whispered chants in the temples to the quiet meditations of the monks, from the offerings placed on altars to the five precepts that bind the layfolk, the Theravada world has been shaped by forces unseen. \n\nSome forces come from within, from the heart of the community itself, the whispers and debates that ripple through the sangha. Others come from the outside, the world beyond the temple walls. Some are benign, indifferent, like the changing seasons. Others are hostile, claws that seek to tear at the fabric of belief.\n\nBut at the heart of it all lie the truths the boy spoke, the four noble truths that echo through the ages. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Attachment, the root of that suffering. The possibility of liberation. And the path, the Eightfold Path, that leads to the end of suffering, the cessation of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.\n\nA long journey, this path. A journey of self-discovery, of facing the darkness within and without. It is a journey that continues, even as the world around us changes. And it is a journey that ultimately leads to the silence, the stillness, the peace that lies at the heart of all things.",
            "The sun bleached bone-white over the border between them. The U.S. and Mexico. A long scar on the face of the world, a feud that ran deeper than the roots of the mesquite. Fifty-seven years it festered, from the dust of '36 to the heat of '93. A bad blood born of clashing creeds and ideologies, of ambition and fear. \n\nThe war, they called it, 1846-48. A bloodletting, a taking. Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed by the hungry maw of the north. But the skirmishes, the whispers of war, they stretched back further, like the shadows on a sun-baked plain.  \n\nIt's a sickness, this rivalry, that bleeds into the bones of nations. A border fence, it ain't just stone and wire. It's a wall of suspicion, built brick by bloody brick. The U.S. and Mexico weren't alone in that suffering. It's the curse of neighbors, the touch of history's hand. Face it, a man can only drink so much whiskey before he starts seeing the devil in his brother's eyes.\n\nReligion, a tinderbox.  Those folks in the north, they saw the Catholic church as a foreign beast, a serpent in the garden.  Just like the cold war, a battle of souls, a struggle for dominance. Only this time, the weapons were prayers and pronouncements, not bombs and bullets.\n\nBut it was the land, the soil itself, that sparked the fire.  Borders, they ain't just lines on a map. They're veins of greed, pulsing with ambition.  Bandits and outlaws, they danced on that line, testing the limits, pushing the boundaries.  And the blood spilled, like water from a broken barrel.\n\nIt took time, and a reckoning, for the fever to break. Mexico, she bowed to necessity, her fate entwined with the north.  The U.S., her hunger shifted, from land to commerce, from conquest to control. \n\nBut the scars remained. A testament to a time when the world was young, and the hunger for power, it gnawed at the heart of men.",
            "Fifteen years back, a sickness crawled into my bones, unseen, unwelcome. A nurse I was, chose it for the comfort it promised, a shield against the shakiness of childhood. \"Always work,\" they'd said, \"Folks always get sick.\" So the dream of science, of stories, faded. Yet there I was, forty-six, alone, with nothing but the hollow echo of what might have been. Fifteen years on disability, the gnawing hunger of emptiness. Nothing left but what's given, the daily struggle, the erosion of self. Nothing certain but the thought: I wouldn't have made it without the hands reaching out, the love pressed against my own. Because truth be told, when the world cracks wide, you find out how little strength you have.\n\nLife, she throws hard things. Big ones, small ones, catches you unawares. No amount of planning can build a wall against every storm.  We hear talk of pulling ourselves up by bootstraps, of a ruggedness that built this land. But in those hard times, it wasn't grit that saw them through, it was the warmth of neighbor to neighbor, the sharing, the lifting each other up.  Wagon trains didn't cross empty plains, they crossed with hands clasped, hearts tied together.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your kit, your water, your food.  Keep a lantern burning, a firebanked. But don't forget the human touch. Get to know the folks next door. Build bridges, not bunkers.  Because when the wind howls, it's the whispers of kindness that will keep you warm.",
            "The question of how life twists and turns, how it carves its path through the vastness, this has haunted men since the dawn of thought. Even now, the true nature of this sculpting, this dance of change, remains shrouded in mystery.  Scientists, like paleontologists poking at the bones of the past, have tried to decipher the language of evolution. They've used tools, these numbers and equations, to map the growth of shells, to trace the lineage of creatures. They speak of \"ontogeny\" and \"phylogeny,\" of spirals and sutures, of whorls that wind around a central pillar, the columella, like a whispered secret.\n\nBut the heart of the matter, the very essence of this transformation, it remains elusive. We can measure the curves, the angles, the increments of growth, but what of the driving force, the unseen hand that guides this unfolding?  Is there a script, a set of rules that dictate this unfolding, or does it spring forth from some chaotic dance of chance and circumstance?  We stand on the shores of this vast ocean of life, gazing at the intricate forms that populate it, and we can only marvel at the mystery.\n\nTake the Prunum, for instance, a creature whose shell speaks of ages past. Its spiral, a chronicle of growth, a testament to the passage of time.  We can map its whorls, its sutures, its aperture, but can we truly understand the forces that shaped it?  Can we capture the essence of its being in equations and graphs?\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nFor the beauty of evolution lies not just in its complexity, but in its ineffable nature. It is a story written in the language of life itself, a story that whispers to us of the profound interconnectedness of all things, a story that, despite our best efforts, may forever remain just beyond our grasp.",
            "The dust of mortality settled thick on the air in Indonesia. For a decade now, the numbers for babes and their mothers, those first fragile breaths, had held steady. A stagnant tide in a sea of progress. The country aimed for the stars, reaching for those Millennium Development Goals, those shimmering promises of water clean and sanitation sound. But the children, the mothers, they clung to the shore, their needs unmet, their futures uncertain.\n\nThere'd been whispers of progress, a sliver of light in the darkness. More births attended by a hand skilled, they said, seventy-two percent now. But a hand skilled could be a midwife's, a weathered hand, not always capable of wielding the sharp tools of medicine when the night took a turn for the worse. And so the mothers bled, their lives spilled like water on cracked earth. The children too, they faltered. Fewer treated for the scourges that stole their childhoods, the killers that lurked in the shadows of every home.\n\nCesarean births, like pale ghosts, flitted through the land. A mere four percent, a whisper against the tide. And even here, a jagged line ran through the country, dividing the rich from the poor, the urban from the rural. Seven percent in the cities, a glimmer of hope, but a mere two percent in the villages, a hollow echo.  And the chasm widened, the poor left behind, their cries unheard, their access to care a distant dream. \n\nThey spoke of solutions, of programs, of a quick fix, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But the question lingered, a shadow in the twilight: would it be a poultice or a cure?  To patch the holes, to mend the broken, or to build a foundation strong enough to withstand the storm?  Programmatic approaches, they promised, swift and sure, but at what cost?  To pour resources into one corner, to draw away from the others, was to leave gaps in the fabric of care.  And what of the human cost, the hearts and minds drawn to the bright lights, leaving the shadows behind?",
            "The grip of Victorian fiction, with its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy, loosens in the faces of novels like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*.  These two works, though born in the Victorian era,  venture beyond its conventions, embracing mystery and the unsettling,  a departure that  deepens the characters within them,  illuminating their motives and emotions in ways that are both profound and unsettling.\n\n\"A host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded upon his mind. He seemed to still walk between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices, their very words, ringing in his ears. When he turned his attention to himself he found he was speaking to them… Suddenly, he recoiled at the sharp report of gunfire. Loud cries and shouts rose, lights flared before his eyes, and all was a maelstrom of noise and chaos, as if some unseen hand bore him away in haste. Through these fragmented visions, a persistent, gnawing pain ran like a thread, wearing him down, tormenting him ceaselessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nMystery, often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, drives both novels.  In *Oliver Twist*, these strange occurrences offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his growing understanding of the harsh reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28,  he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that have unfolded, and the dire state his health has reached. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit amplify his despair. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses numbed, he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. The incident raises questions about whose will has brought about his misfortune. It certainly wasn't his own. This shooting reinforces Oliver's sense of helplessness, as he fails to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing resignation and defeat in Oliver is implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair, hindering his ability to react.  Had he not been broken, one would expect Oliver to at least try to fight for his survival. \n\n\n\"The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night descended again; night long, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence, short in its passing hours.\"",
            "The dust kicked up by the boy's worn shoes hung heavy in the air. He was small, maybe eight or nine, eyes the color of a winter sky. Worked with the other kids at the after-school program, tried to help them with their books. Me, I was good with words, stories. But this boy, Adrian, he was different. Letters he knew, some, but others... they seemed to twist and turn in his head, nonsensical sounds spilling out.  An odd thing, a boy speaking English clear as day, yet stumbling on the alphabet.  His mother came in one day. Couldn't say a word of English. Just Spanish, her words a tangle of sounds I barely understood.  But it clicked then, a cold certainty. The boy, he knew how to read, just not the English letters. Like a song in a language he'd never heard.\n\nI tell this story, because language is a wall, brick by brick, and sometimes the mortar crumbles. California, with its tongues a tapestry of sound, it's a place where this wall is thick, and children fall through the cracks. Adrian, he was lucky. A little tutoring, some extra help with the alphabet, and the world opened up for him. But others, they stay lost. \n\nThe solutions, they're not simple. Dual language programs, good in theory, but need more than just good intentions. Bilingual aids, tutors, teachers... it takes a village. And mainstream immersion?  It's a gamble, a hope that the child will somehow learn by being thrown into the current.  But there's no single answer, no magic spell. It takes all of them, woven together, to bridge the gap.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat to the slow dying of the light. We sat on the porch, me and my father, smoke curling from our cigarettes like prayers to a deaf god. He'd gone thin, bones poking through the skin, clothes hanging loose on his wasted frame. His eyes, though, they still held a flicker, like a dying ember in the ash.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" he said, when I asked about his favorite bird. His voice rasped, dry as the leaves clinging to the skeletal branches outside.\n\nHe looked out at the rain, a look that spoke of things seen and lost, memories swallowed by the downpour. I wanted to ask him about them, about what haunted those eyes, but the words caught in my throat. \n\nWe sat in silence, the rain drowning out the sound of our own breaths. The shadows lengthened, the world shrinking to the porch and the rain and the man who was my father, fading away.\n\nMonths later, the rain still fell. A different kind of rain now, the kind that falls on graves. December had come, a cold fist squeezing the life from the world. My father was gone, the chemo and the radiation only delaying the inevitable. \n\nThey said he died peacefully. That he'd breathed his last surrounded by loved ones. But I wasn't there. Couldn't bear to be there. Watching life ebb away, the light in his eyes dimming, a mirror reflecting my own fear. I knew better than to look. I knew he wouldn't want that.\n\nSo I stayed away. Closed myself in my room, the rain a constant drumming on the roof, a dirge for a life lived and lost.\n\nThey say God is a comfort, a light in the darkness. But all I saw was the darkness. The rain, the empty chair, the silence that echoed with his absence.\n\nNo one called, not even to tell me he was gone.\n\nAnd in the empty space where he used to be, all I heard was the rain, whispering its empty promises.",
            "The Gothic, they say, is a bastard child of contradiction, an oxymoron born of “Old-New.”  Watt called it that, saw it as a thing both steeped in the past and a harbinger of what was to come.  Some dismiss it as shallow, others exalt it for its terror, its “terrible sublime.”  Walpole, he who birthed this thing, claimed to be writing a “Gothic Story.”  He took the old, the theatrical, the ghosts of forgotten plays, and wove them into the new, the form of the novel, this window into the soul.  He gave us the monster in the shadows, the hero grappling not just with the external but with the darkness within. \n\nIt’s a  beast with roots sunk deep in the mud of medieval castles and crumbling cathedrals, in the shadows of the knightly order, that chivalric ideal.  But “Gothic” was a word already stained with the dust of ages, a relic, a thing to be cast aside in the face of progress.  And yet, it lingers.  The Gothic, it finds purchase in the human heart, in the way we crave the familiar and the unknown, the comfort of shadows and the dread they cast.  \n\nWalpole,  he saw the world unraveling, a society adrift in a sea of uncertainty.  He looked back to the knight, the image of honor and strength, and wove it into his tale.  Frederic, the prince, the fallen hero, he is a man shaped by loss, haunted by the ghosts of a better time.  He is the Gothic ideal, flawed but striving, a mirror reflecting our own fears and desires.",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a grey ribbon unwinding through a landscape scrubbed clean. Dust, fine as bone meal, hung in the air, catching the light of the pale sun like a shroud. This was the chain, he thought, the thread that linked things. From the clamor of the want, the hunger in the belly of the market, to the raw materials dug from the earth, to the factories where metal groaned and gears ground, to the trucks that rumbled across the empty plains, delivering their precious cargo to the hungry maw of the customer.  It was a process, a dance of necessity, and he, a driver on this road, knew its steps by heart. \n\nThey called it supply chain management, a sterile name for a dance as old as civilization itself. It was Oliver, a man with a name as cold as the steel of a machine, who first coined the phrase back in '82. He saw the system, the interconnectedness, and gave it a name. Six elements, he said, six pillars to hold up this vast structure. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, information.  Each one a cog in the wheel, each one vital to the whole.  \n\nProduction, the heart of the dance. The forge where raw materials were molded into something new, a symphony of clanging metal and roaring fire.  It was here the decisions were made, the blueprints scrawled, the orders issued.  The market, a hungry beast, demanded its due, and production answered with a steady pulse. Managers, the conductors of this orchestra, read the market's whispers, its sighs and screams, and translated them into language the machines understood.  They knew the rhythm, the ebb and flow, the need to anticipate the next beat.  \n\nSupply followed close behind, the veins that pulsed with the lifeblood of the chain.  The source of the raw materials, the partnerships forged, the deals struck.  Managers, like shepherds, guided this flow, ensuring the right materials arrived at the right place, at the right time.  They knew the weight of each barrel, the fragility of each component, the cost of delay.\n\nInventory, the stockpile, the waiting room where goods gathered before their journey.  Managers, the gatekeepers, watched over this hoard, balancing the need for enough with the cost of storage. They knew the dangers of excess, the fragility of neglect.\n\nLocation, the crossroads, the nexus where decisions were made.  Managers, the cartographers, mapped the landscape, weighing the costs and benefits of each potential site. They knew the importance of proximity, the value of access, the need for efficiency.\n\nTransportation, the arteries, the veins that carried the goods across the land.  Managers, the navigators, charted the courses, choosing the safest, the fastest, the most economical routes. They knew the dangers of delay, the cost of lost time.\n\nInformation, the pulse, the heartbeat of the chain.  Managers, the interpreters, gathered data, analyzed trends, and shared knowledge.  They knew the power of information, the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond.\n\nEach element, a piece of a puzzle, a cog in a machine.  And the managers, the keepers of the chain, the ones who understood the rhythm, the flow, the vital dance of supply.",

Beneath it, Ellen Page stood, a ghost of a celebrity, her face pale and drawn against the dust-choked air. Burma, they called it now. Myanmar. A land choked by the iron fist of a junta, a place where silence was the only law.\n\nThe year was 1962. A coup had ripped the country apart, a shadow cast long over the land. The whispers of dissent, like dying embers, flickered and died. Then, in 2007, a spark. A flame ignited in the saffron robes of the monks, a revolution born of the color of their faith. The Saffron Revolution. They marched, chanting, their voices rising like a tide against the tide of tyranny. \n\nThe government, blinded by fear, struck back. The peaceful protests turned to a maelstrom of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, became battlefields. Journalists, chroniclers of truth, were corralled and silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking to capture the world's pain, fell, his camera a silent witness to the brutality.\n\nThe official death toll, a lie whispered on the wind, claimed 13 souls. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had seen the darkness, spoke of a horror far greater. \"Several thousand,\" he murmured, his voice a broken echo of the truth.\n\nThis, though, was nothing new. From the Caesars, who claimed divinity, to the Japanese emperors, whose godhood was a twisted mask for tyranny, the hunger for power had stained the world red. Even now, in this land, where a president held court with a man who led a cult of the ignorant, the thirst for control remained.\n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of students, intellectuals, workers, dared to dream of freedom. The tanks rolled in, crushing their hopes under their treads. The official story spoke of 200-300 dead. The truth, whispered in the shadows, spoke of thousands.\n\nRwanda. The genocide, a stain on humanity's soul. A Hutu-led slaughter that consumed Tutsis and moderates alike. The air thick with the stench of death.\n\nAnd then, the Third Reich. Hitler's shadow, long and dark, stretched across Europe, consuming millions in its fiery embrace.\n\nThe sign, a testament to the enduring fight against oppression, seemed to crackle with a quiet defiance. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". A lie, perhaps. But a truth that resonated with the ache in the heart of the world.",
            "The Duke, they called him. Ellington. His music, it clung to you like smoke, a slow burn in the bones. He'd carve out a sound, a world, with his piano, but it was his orchestra, his men, his women, that made it sing. Not just notes, no. He gave them space to breathe, to wail, to speak their own truths in the music. Each man, a voice, a color against the dark canvas of his arrangements.\n\nHe didn't just write for the piano, he wrote for the soul. A piece, it wasn't just notes on a page, it was a story waiting to unfold. A city, a dream, a memory. He'd lay down the framework, the bones, and then let his players' spirits take over.\n\nThey said it in the books, those Grove Music fellas. \"Creole Love Call,\" they called it. Voice, not words, but pure sound, like a sigh on the wind. A conversation, a whisper, a scream, all wrapped up in the music.

            "The need had always been there, a gnawing hunger in her soul. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and hadn't subsided three years later.  She'd come to understand it wasn't for things, but for someone.  Yet, no boy had ever stirred the embers of desire within her. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit, but she remained untouched, a fortress of indifference.  She questioned herself, searched for an answer in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind. Theories flickered and died, leaving her in the cold silence of uncertainty.  She lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nHer days at home were usually peaceful, a haven of calm in a world that often seemed to spin too fast. Her parents, salt of the earth, moved through life with a quiet grace, their love a constant, unwavering presence.  Arguments were rare, a foreign language in their home.  The only discord came from her own rebellious spirit, her need to carve her own path, a solitary flame against the backdrop of their quiet contentment.\n\nBut this day was different.  A discordant note struck the harmony as she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, when a cry, sharp and thin, sliced through the air. Her mother's voice, strained and filled with pain, echoed from the kitchen.  Panic clawed at her throat as she ran, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\"  \n\nShe found her mother on the floor, a tableau of pain and vulnerability.  Her breaths came in ragged gasps, each one punctuated by a soft \"Ow.\"  Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of fear washing over her. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to take you.\"\n\nHer mother's voice, weak and strained, directed her hands with a trembling urgency.  In that moment, the strength she'd built in her own body, a testament to her restless spirit, became a beacon of hope.  She lifted her mother, the weight a burden and a blessing, and carried her to the car.  \n\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but her mind was a storm of concern, focused solely on her mother.  She rushed her inside, her voice a frantic plea for help.  A blur of faces, white coats, and hurried words surrounded her as they wheeled her mother away. She was left alone, the weight of her mother's fate pressing down on her, a heavy silence filling the space where her mother's laughter usually resided.\n\nThe story, when it was finally pieced together, was a simple one.  A fall from a stool, a reach for a vase, a misplaced step. But the simplicity couldn't mask the terror that had gripped her heart.",

But here, the air was thin and dry. \n\nThey wanted to know if this diet, this aMed, could hold back the tide of sickness. Could it ward off the cold grip of heart disease and the sudden, brutal blow of a stroke? \n\nThey followed these women, 74,886 of them, their lives laid out like a map, their food choices recorded in meticulous detail. Questionnaires, they called them, these scraps of paper holding the weight of years. They asked about the things they ate: the fruits, the nuts, the fish, the oil that tasted of sunlight. And the things they avoided: the meat, the fat, the things that rotted the body from within. \n\nThe women's lives unfolded against the backdrop of a relentless march of time. They watched as years bled into decades, as bodies changed, as shadows grew longer. Some women fell ill, their faces etched with pain, their breaths shallow and quick. Others lived on, their lives a testament to resilience, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness. \n\nThey measured their lives in numbers, in risks and ratios, in the bitterness of aspirin and the fleeting comfort of a multivitamin. They looked for patterns, for threads that might unravel the mysteries of life and death.\n\nAnd in the end, what did they find? A glimmer of hope. A whisper of possibility. The women who ate like the sun, they found, lived longer, healthier lives. The women who clung to the shadows, they withered away.  \n\nIt wasn't enough, of course. Not a cure, not a guarantee. Just a glimpse of a world where life might hold a little more light, a little more warmth. A world where the dust could settle, and the sun could shine again.",

He sought to extend his own power, but the beast had other plans. It didn't care for presidents, for policies, for promises.

Mortgages like cheap whiskey, easy to swallow, leaving a burning in the throat but a false promise of comfort.\n\nHolmes, he saw it coming. A prophet in a newspaper, his words stark against the glittering facade. He spoke of trouble, of a storm brewing, a government rescue. But the music played on, the dance continued, and the storm broke.\n\nThe houses, they ceased to be homes. They became numbers, assets, collateral. The people, their dreams stuffed into the pockets of the wealthy, left with nothing but empty rooms and hollow promises.\n\nAnd the banks? They rotted from within, their arteries clogged with the sludge of bad loans. The giants fell, one by one, their collapse echoing through the canyons of Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, names whispered in fear. They survived, transformed, their claws sunk deeper into the flesh of the nation.\n\nFannie and Freddie, they were the casualties. Their names now synonymous with failure, their bodies propped up by the very government they had served.\n\nThe air is thick with the smell of ash, the taste of dust. The ground trembles, the foundations crack. The people stand, dazed and uncertain, in the ruins of their dreams.\n\nAnd the question remains: how do we rebuild? How do we stand against the tide of greed and folly? How do we find our way back to the light?",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a perpetual haze settling over everything.  It clung to the back of his throat, a gritty reminder of the world that had been consumed.  He tightened his grip on the boy's hand, their fingers intertwined like the roots of ancient oaks clinging to a crumbling hillside.  They were moving south, fleeing the relentless chill that had seeped into the bones of the land.  Winter was coming, a predator stalking the horizon, and they had to outrun it.  \n\nThe boy, his eyes wide and reflecting the faint light of the dying sun, looked up at him, his voice a small whisper against the wind. \"Are we going to die?\"\n\nHe squeezed his hand, a silent reassurance. \"Not now,\" he rasped, his voice rough from disuse. \"Not yet.\"  \n\nThey walked in silence, the only sound the crunch of dead leaves underfoot and the boy's soft breathing.  The world stretched out before them, a desolate canvas of ash-covered fields and skeletal trees reaching towards a sky choked with smoke.  A city, once a monument to human ambition, now lay in ruins, a jagged scar on the landscape.  It was a place where ghosts walked, where memories lingered like the scent of smoke and decay.  They had seen things along the way, things that would haunt their dreams for years to come.  But they pressed on, driven by a desperate hope for a future, for warmth, for a world where the sun still shone and the air was not thick with the taste of ash.",
            "The screen flickered, a pale ghost of light in the dusk. Two voices, distant and hollow, droned out stories from a city named Columbus, Ohio. The first, an NBC dispatch, a man, a name – Shad Hostettler – a face, a cold stare, a mugshot in the flickering gloom. Ashley. Ohio. Stabbing.  The wife nameless, a shadow in the brief account. Evil, the word hung in the air, a thin, acrid taste. Two minutes, they gave it, a passing glance.\n\nThe next story, Travis Buyers, eighteen. A young whisper, cut short in the Sharon Woods. Shooting, critical, no names, no faces. A shadowy figure, a black hole where a life should have been. The SWAT team moved in, silent, efficient, but the story itself, brief, hurried,  like a bird fleeing a sudden storm.  A stain on the edges of the screen, barely there. \n\nA .22.  A helicopter, a wound in its side, a story of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward, a whispered plea for justice. The city held its breath.\n\nRain. Thunder. A weekend forecast, a promise of a storm. A fleeting glance, a nudge to keep watching.\n\nThen,  a robbery. A Clime Road UDF.  A dark figure, a hoodie, \na weight of words, an insistence on color. Six-foot tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. Black.  \n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a name from Texas, a legacy of marijuana, 300 months.  A Hispanic man. A statistic, a label, a cold whisper in the night.\n\nThe screen flickered again, the voices faded, and the darkness returned.",
            "The blood ties bind, they do. A brother to a brother. A knot that can't be untied, no matter the tangle. It's a thing of darkness and light, woven with love and hate, pride and scorn. A brother sees his own reflection in the eyes of another, clearer than any mirror. He sees the good and the bad, the truth that hides from the world. And when the world turns dark, that bond tightens, reveals its true heart. \n\nIt's a costly thing, this understanding. The weight of it crushes you down, leaves scars you can't hide. But in the shadow of that knowledge, you learn what it means to be a man. You learn what it means to be bound.\n\nThey walked through a world painted in the colors of decay, two brothers against the dying light. A journey, futile and desperate, etched across the landscape like a scar. Pride, sharp and bitter, clashed against the desperation of hope. Blood spilled in the fading light, and only one man walked away.  \n\nThe older brother, he saw himself in the younger, a reflection warped by time and circumstance. His own failings, his own hunger for a world that wasn't there, they stared back at him.  He saw the boy, Doodle, as a burden, a shadow clinging to his heels. But in the depths of that shadow, he saw a spark. A flicker of life that mirrored his own.\n\nHe tried to teach him, to break him free of that fragile shell. To mold him into the warrior he wished he could be. But the boy, he was born broken. A fragile bird with clipped wings.  And the older brother, he was the one who clipped them. \n\nThe world around them, it was a canvas painted in shades of gray. The air hung heavy with the scent of decay. It was a world that mirrored the darkness in their hearts.",
            "The mind. A tangled thicket. A whispering canyon. They called it a machine once. A clockwork thing. Then a loom, weaving patterns from the threads of sense. Now they speak of circuits and algorithms, but the truth is darker. The brain is a cave, a labyrinth of shadow and bone, where the echoes of experience cling to the damp walls.\n\nIt takes in the world through senses, raw sensations like water seeping through a sieve. Touch, taste, sound, sight – these are the building blocks, the primal stones. But the mind, it shapes them. It twists, it turns, it carves meaning from the chaos.\n\nImagine a box, a black void on a white expanse. The eye sees it, the brain interprets.  But what is a box? A shape, a container, a memory of a past confinement.  The mind doesn't just see, it remembers, it anticipates, it builds stories from the fragments.  It judges, it sifts, it chooses what to hold onto, what to cast aside.\n\nAttention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it burns bright on a single point, then fades, leaving everything else to drift.  A name spoken in a crowd, a single blade of grass against the dust.  The mind filters, it protects, it prioritizes.\n\nAnd memory. A phantom limb, a ghost in the machine.  The past lingers, a faint scent, a half-remembered dream.  Sensory, working, long-term – these are just labels, attempts to categorize the untamable.  Memories cling to the brain like barnacles to a hull, some smooth and polished, others rough and jagged.\n\nHow is knowledge stored?  A network?  A map?  A tapestry woven from threads of experience?  Perhaps it's something else entirely, a language spoken only by neurons, a symphony of chemical signals.\n\nThe truth, like the brain itself, remains elusive.  A mystery hidden in plain sight, a labyrinth waiting to be explored.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of some long-gone world. Huxley, he saw it coming, this brave new dawn. A sun bleached and sterile, a sky choked with the smoke of progress.  He built this world, this *Brave New World*, to show us the price of comfort, the cost of forgetting. They chased happiness like a phantom, these people, conditioned from birth to believe in the illusion. They were cogs in a machine, oiled by pleasure and ignorance.\n\nHe saw through it, Huxley did. Through the World Controller's blinding light, through the manufactured contentment. He smelled the rot beneath the surface, the stench of homogeny and reification. These were not men and women, but products, their souls ground down and molded into conformity. They  were slaves to the system, their minds dulled by the constant hum of false consciousness.\n\nHe spoke their language, Huxley did. He used their words, their terms - *capitalism*, *proletariat*, *hegemony*. He laid bare the truth, the gnawing emptiness at the heart of their 'perfect' world. They thought they were free, these people, but they were bound by invisible chains, forged in the fires of consumerism.  \n\nAnd love? Love was a forgotten relic, a whisper in the wind.  The touch of another human being was reduced to a transaction, a fleeting moment of manufactured intimacy.  They were shadows, these people, their individuality extinguished by the relentless glare of their own desires. \n\nHuxley saw it all, the darkness lurking behind the facade. He knew that true freedom was not found in the pursuit of pleasure, but in the acceptance of pain, in the embrace of the human condition. He left us with a warning, a stark reminder that the pursuit of happiness can lead to the greatest of tragedies.",
            "The limestone dust lay thick on the campus. Four and a half semesters. That's how long I'd been here, a boy adrift in this sea of brick and mortar. East Halls they called it, the place they shoved you when you first came in, like a stray dog in a holding pen. The damned place was a world away from Willard, a godforsaken trek across barren fields and asphalt plains. Twenty-five minutes on foot, they said. More like an hour when the wind sliced through you like a butcher's blade. The old timers, they talked of it as a different time, these halls swallowed by fields, a forgotten wilderness. Now it was choked with new buildings, a monument to their hunger for growth. The Creamery, the health center, all rising like tombstones in the dust. But the ground beneath still remembers. It remembers the emptiness, the silence. \n\nA friend, a brother in this struggle, he'd come back to the bike. Years he'd been away, but the truth of it never fades: \"Bikes,\" he said, his voice rough like gravel, \"The only way to move.\" A bowl of gruel and a man's will, that's all it takes. Thirty miles, maybe more. I saw it this year, the truth of it. Off-campus now, just like those dorms, a world away from the heart of things. But I bought a bike. A salvation. Twenty-five minutes, maybe an hour, cut to five if the wind's at your back. Pollock Road, that black scar cutting through the campus, it's not a kind road. But it's the shortest path.  Time is a thief, they say. And it's stealing mine.  Walking, they say, good for the soul. But the soul has no time for sentiment. A bike, it's freedom. It's the only way to outrun the dust."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.

            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The road ahead lay dust-grey and bare. The sun, a pale eye in the ashen sky, offered no comfort. A life in service to others had always called to him, a pull as insistent as the wind across the barren plains. It wasn't a path laid out clear, more a slow burn in the soul, a knowing. He'd seen the cracks in the world, the ways folks tried to patch them with lies and denials. A Bachelors in Psychology, a degree meant to unravel the knots in the human mind, had given him a glimpse, but not the answers. Then came the boy, a shadow perched on a friend's couch, his eyes haunted by things too heavy for sixteen years to bear. A family shattered, a system indifferent. It was a silent plea, a cry for the kind of help that went beyond the law, beyond the cold logic of statutes.  \n\nHe saw the desperation in the parents' eyes, the way they twisted the truth, the way they wore their own pain like a shield. The boy needed more than words, he needed a hand, a steady presence in the storm. That day, the road called him towards service, towards a fight against the shadows that gnawed at the edges of humanity.\n\nThe world, he knew, held a strange contradiction. It mourned the lost, yet clung to conformity, a fear of the individual blooming like a weed in the cracks of society.  He saw injustice, the kind that suffocated the spirit, the kind that whispered to the broken. He fought it in his own way, a splash of color against the monotone, a voice raised in defiance. GSBA, piercings, a refusal to be molded into the expected shape. It was a silent rebellion, a testament to the value of the unique, the individual.\n\nSocial work, he realized, was more than a profession, it was a calling. A chance to mend the fractured world, to be a witness to the pain and the resilience of the human spirit. It was a road paved with challenges, but he walked it with a heart open to the struggle, to the fight for justice, and to the quiet dignity of those who dared to be different.",
            "The night bleeds in on itself, a darkness thick as iron. Sleep, a fickle thing. It slips from some like water through fingers, a whisper of what might have been.  Insomnia, a thief in the shadows, steals the hours, leaving behind a bone-deep weariness. They talk of it in whispers, these models.  Biological, sociocultural.  Words that hold the weight of answers, but offer only a glimpse in the flickering darkness.\n\nThe body, a vessel of inheritance, its circuits wired by genes spun from the loom of time.  Sleep, a rhythm etched in the marrow, governed by the pulse of the hypothalamus, the orexin neurons whispering their coded language.  A study, mice beneath a cold lamp, their tiny bodies the echoes of our own.  They probed the GABAB receptors, these keys to the gates of slumber.  A twist, a nudge, and the sleep-wake cycle shifts. Baclofen, a whisper of a name, a chemical promise of rest.  The mice, models, reflections.  Could their slumber hold a key to our own?\n\nBut the night is vast, and the body is but a fragment.  The world outside, a tapestry woven with threads of circumstance.  Sociocultural, they call it.  Race, ethnicity, the ghosts of history clinging to the soul.  Socioeconomic status, a chasm that yawns wide, a barrier to restful nights.\n\nThey study these things, seeking patterns in the chaos.  A thread here, a shadow there.  But the night is a labyrinth, and the answers, if they exist, are buried deep within its folds.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, a dry rasp against bone. A barren world, cracked and bleached, stretched to the horizon. The boy huddled closer, his breath frosting in the air.\n\n\"They whisper,\" he said, his voice a thin thread against the wind. \"They say the ears don't hear, but the head understands.\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the boy's shoulder. \"The ears hear enough. It's the mind that forgets.\"\n\nHe had seen the towns rot, whole cities swallowed by the dust. Heard the whispers in the wind, the echoes of forgotten voices. He knew the truth of it now.  The world was a place of broken things, of minds turned brittle, ears deaf to the song of the earth.\n\nThey spoke of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a name that tasted like ash on the tongue. A sickness of the brain, they called it. But the man knew better. It was a sickness of the soul, a forgetting of the world's music.\n\nHe had seen the signs, the boys and girls staring blankly, unable to follow the thread of a conversation, lost in a silence that gnawed at their insides. Their minds, like parched earth, unable to absorb the rain of sound.\n\nHe knew the teachers, their faces weary, their hearts heavy with the weight of trying to mend what was broken. They offered tests and charts, but the answers lay buried deep within the silence. \n\nThey couldn't hear the music, the whispers of the wind, the heartbeat of the earth. They were trapped in a world of their own making, a world devoid of sound, devoid of meaning.\n\nHe held the boy closer, his own heart aching.  He knew the darkness that threatened to engulf them all. He knew the only way to fight it was to remember the song, to keep the melody alive, even in the face of the silence.",
            "The play Twelfth Night speaks of a truth, veiled though it may be: that disguise, while it can serve as a cloak for deception,  can also become a shroud, swallowing the self whole. It's a dangerous game, this shedding of skin, for in revealing the truth, one risks tearing at the bonds of those around them. Some may accept the mask fell, others will recoil, the charade a stain upon their trust. This truth is magnified when the disguise takes on the form of gender, a delicate dance between self and other, a question of who one is beneath the surface.\n\nWhy does one choose to abandon their true self, to wear the garments of another? In Viola's case, it is a question of survival, a desperate act of self-preservation in a world that can be cruel to the vulnerable. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). But this shield, this borrowed armor, isolates her from the solace of her own kind, leaving her adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the deception deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own making. Olivia, drawn to the fabricated Cesario, finds herself entangled in a web of mistaken affections. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). The mask not only shields, it distorts, leading to a love born of illusion.  \n\nThis play, a tapestry woven with intricate threads of deception, also probes the depths of unspoken desires, exposed by the veil of Viola's disguise. Does Olivia's longing for Cesario stem from a fascination with the male form, or does it hint at a deeper yearning, a secret impulse buried beneath the societal constraints of her time? And what of Orsino? His words, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261), echo with a yearning that seems to find its voice only through the lens of Viola's perceived masculinity. \n\nTwelfth Night, then, becomes a mirror held up to the human heart, reflecting the complexities of identity, desire, and the perilous consequences of playing a role. It asks us to confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the most dangerous masks are the ones we wear to protect ourselves, for in hiding our true selves, we risk losing ourselves entirely.",
            "The dust of the empire clung to everything. A fine gray powder that settled on the tongues of men and the pages of forgotten books. German rule, they called it. A name that tasted like iron and ash in the mouth.  The stories they told, they spoke of a cruelty that carved its mark on the land itself. The Ovaherero and Nama, they said, were swept away like leaves in a windstorm, their bones bleached white in the sun. But the wind, it whispers its secrets in many tongues. The empire was a vast and shifting thing, a tapestry woven from threads of darkness and light. \n\nThey spoke of schools in the east, of tongues loosened and minds opened. Children, eyes bright with the promise of knowledge, learning the language of the conquerors, learning the ways of the world beyond the savanna. But here, in the west, a different song played out. A song of silence and shadow. The missionaries, they came with their Bibles and their hymns, their voices echoing hollowly in the empty plains. The government, it turned a blind eye, turning its back on the silent pleas of a people yearning for light. \n\nThe sun beat down on the cracked earth, baking the bones of the forgotten. The children, they were left to wander in the wasteland of ignorance, their voices unheard, their futures unwritten. A gulf yawned between them and the world that lay beyond the horizon.

A world where the canvas bled with color and the brush sang a song of its own. \n\nHe dreamt of acceptance. Of the whispers in darkened galleries, the murmurs of praise. Of men in frock coats and ladies in velvet gowns, their faces awash in the lamplight, nodding their approval. But the world he knew was a different thing. A world of grey streets and the sharp smell of soot. A world where art was a matter of brushstrokes and technique, of blending and shading, of mimicking the masters.  \n\nHis canvas, it called to him. It begged for the colors of his dreams. But the fear lingered, a shadow in the corners of his mind. Could he, a man who had never known the comfort of a master's hand, dare to paint outside the lines? To carve his own path, to stand alone in the cacophony of the art world?\n\nHe was restless, this Rousseau. He yearned for the recognition, the validation.  But he also felt the pull of his own vision, the whispers of the dreams that danced behind his eyes. To paint as he saw, not as they expected. To be the artist he was meant to be, even if it meant standing apart.\n\nHe lived with this conflict, this internal struggle. A tight knot in his chest, a question mark hanging in the air.  The Dream, they called it. But for him, it was more than a painting. It was a reflection of his soul, a battleground where the artist and the man clashed.  Could he find peace? Could he bridge the gap between his yearning for approval and his burning desire to be true to himself? \n\nOnly time, and the stroke of the brush, would tell.",
            "The line they whisper, the thinkers, about the ties that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty.  It ain't no accident.  Like Keats saw it, beauty, truth, all you need to know.  We cram knowledge down our throats, facts and figures, stories learned by rote. But beauty, goodness, that ain't no lesson.  We stumble into it, feel it in the hollows of our bones. \n\nWe dissect art, break down morals, try to find the formula, the blueprint.  We talk about brushstrokes, composition, right and wrong.  But that ain't it, not the heart of it. You can't boil down the Mona Lisa to ratios and perspective.  When someone says, \"There's just something about it,\" they're closer to the truth. A story, like O'Connor said, is a way to say what words can't, what logic can't touch. There's a space left over, a silence that sings. \n\nIt's like that with ethics too. Wittgenstein, he knew it. You can't capture it, pin it down. Ethics is beyond words, a wind you feel on your face, a cold stone in your gut.  \n\nArt and morality, they both reach for something beyond the known, something that hums in the dark corners of the soul. Literature, it's got that most of all, the way it lays bare the heart's darkness and its light.  It's about values, McKean said, the things that make a life worth living, worth fighting for.  And maybe that's where the truth lies, in the shared space between these two mysteries, where reason falters and the soul speaks.",
            "The echo of Germany hangs heavy, a land forged in the fires of history. From the shadowed peaks of München to the salt-laced winds of Kiel, a singular spirit runs deep. It spills from the cobbled streets of Köln, whispers in the wind that sweeps through Dresden, a city carved out of stone and memory on the banks of the Elbe.  \n\nBut this Germany, this land of song and shadow, wasn't born whole. It rose from the dust of countless tribes, their whispers lost to time but their bones woven into the fabric of the land. \n\nGermania, the ancient cradle of the German people, a name shrouded in the fog of history. Tacitus, the Roman chronicler, traced its roots to the Tungrians, a tribe that, he claimed, crossed the Rhine, leaving behind the ghosts of their former selves to wage war against the Gauls. Caesar, the architect of empires, first wielded the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of conquest. A label, perhaps, born out of necessity, to distinguish the conquered from the unconquered. He borrowed it from the Gauls themselves, a whispered word that carried the weight of their fear and their respect. \n\nBut the whispers persist. Some say the name germinated from the spear they wielded, the \"ger,\" a weapon etched in blood and courage. Others, that it sprang from the guttural cry of \"garim,\" the Old Irish word for \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the battlefields. \n\nTacitus, in his desolate masterpiece, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched, unmarred by the stain of foreign blood. He saw them as the sons and daughters of the earth, their roots running deep into the very heart of the land. \n\nBut Rome, ever hungry, ever reaching, sent its legions to the borders of Germania. They came for gold, for slaves, for plunder, leaving behind a trail of devastation in their wake. The Germans, however, were not easily subdued. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills, and even fought for Rome, their swords stained with the blood of both friend and foe.\n\nThe story of Germany is a tapestry woven from threads of conquest and resistance, a symphony of clashing cultures, a testament to the enduring spirit of a people who refused to be silenced.",

This mundane act, this public defilement. \n\nThe artist I knew once talked about seeing the world in frames, simplifying it to its barest elements.

But the truth of it is older than science. It's the hunger in their eyes, the recklessness that sings in their blood. The need to feel alive, even if it means dancing with death.\n\nThey pile in, these young ones, their laughter ringing like shattered glass. Two or three in a car, more if they can squeeze. Backseats bursting, limbs tangled, the air thick with the scent of freedom and fear. And somewhere in that tangle, a skull cracks, a heart stops.  \n\nThey try to cage them, these young birds. Temporary licenses, they call them. Hours of driving, restrictions on passengers. But the cage can't hold the wildness. The need to fly.\n\nThe old man knows. He remembers his own youth, the hunger in his veins. He remembers the thrill of the open road, the wind whipping through his hair.  It's a feeling that stays with you, even when you're old and gray. \n\nBut the world has changed. The roads are harder, the drivers more desperate. The shadows are longer, the darkness deeper. Even the stars have lost their shine.\n\nThis is a slow burn, this tragedy unfolding. A slow and terrible fire that consumes the young. But it's a fire that can be stopped. The old man knows this. We can build a wall, a fortress of law and order. We can keep them safe, for a while, at least. But the hunger will always be there. The need to fly. And someday, it will break free.",
            "The Library of Congress, a mausoleum of forgotten things, held a cache of Edison’s early films. Fifteen trick films, they called them, from the twilight years of the 19th century to the dawn of the 20th. Illusions spun from the darkroom, conjured by the twitch of a lever, the sleight of a hand in the flickering light.  My study, a pilgrimage through these shadows, sought to unravel the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the faint echo of innovation in a few that dared to stray.\n\nThe trick film, in its prime, was a thing of constraint. Bound by the stage, a proscenium frame its prison, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile and watching. Long shots, medium shots, these were the tools of the trade. Close-ups, a language yet to be spoken, were absent. No movement of the camera to follow the dance of figures, only a static tableau, a glimpse into a world frozen in time. \n\nLike Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors would shuffle across the stage, a ghostly procession, confined to the horizontal plane. They would vanish from view, but the camera remained indifferent, its gaze unwavering.\n\nThis stage-bound world, inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville, from the whispers of magic, demanded a certain kind of illusion.  Actors moved side to side, never forward or back. The audience, like the camera, was a passive observer, privy to a world that existed only within the confines of the frame.\n\nOne concept, one shot. This was the mantra of the trick film. A minute, a fleeting moment captured in the blink of an eye. The narrative, if there was one, was a whisper, a ghost story told in shadows and smoke, a fleeting glimpse into the impossible. \n\nBut even within these constraints, there were whispers of rebellion. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a film seemingly single-shot in its entirety, a closer examination reveals a subtle shift. The moment where Mary’s severed “head” appears, a brief flicker in the darkness, betrays the illusion. The single shot is a composite, a carefully constructed lie woven from multiple threads of truth.",
            "The dust of Caroline clung to John Taylor like the memory of a fallen summer. A man of the soil, his hands calloused from the tilling, his mind shaped by the rhythm of the seasons. He believed in the honest sweat of the land, in the quiet dignity of a man who worked with his own two hands.  That belief was the bedrock of his politics, a stubborn insistence on freedom, on a government that served the farmer, not the other way around.\n\nHe saw in the newborn nation a rare chance, a blank slate upon which to etch a society fit for men of substance, men who understood the value of self-reliance.  He spoke of natural rights, of a web woven tight, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole.  He feared the city, the whispers of men who sought power, who saw in weakness a chance for gain.  He remembered the stories of old, of kings and emperors, of how men with ambition devoured the land and the people.  This, he swore, would not be their way.\n\nHe saw the truth in the duality of man, in the good and the bad that warred within every heart.  A government, he argued, had to be built to reflect that truth, to hold the darkness at bay while nurturing the light.  He spoke of principles, of the sanctity of property, the vital importance of the farm, the need to resist the siren song of unchecked wealth.   He believed that even the best intentions could be corrupted, that power, once tasted, could turn bitter.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution, a believer in its letter and its spirit, a champion of limited government.  He saw the danger in a sprawling federal machine, in its reach for power beyond its mandate.  He held the Declaration of Independence close, its words a beacon, reminding them that the nation was built on the idea of sovereign states, united yet free.\n\nHe was John Taylor of Caroline, a farmer, a politician, a man who believed in the power of the land, the strength of the individual, and the fragility of freedom. And he would fight, with every fiber of his being, to protect it.",
            "The fall turned hard. Submissions, they dipped down like a stone in the river. Figure 17, third month. Figure seventeen, a cold wind whistling through the bones. Couldn't say why. Winter, it grips you tight in these parts. Less folk walking, less bikes. December, a time for books and grades, for the closing of one year and the start of another. The holidays, they come like a shroud, swallowing everything whole. No need to come to the campus then. January, too, a slate wiped clean, a new semester. Then February. Still hollow.\n\nMaybe it's the way of things. A fire, it burns bright at first, then the embers fade. We tried to stoke the flames, a Carpool Challenge Week in March. A flurry of activity, a burst of light. Helped, for a time. But the urge to drive, it's in our blood, a deep vein in this country. You gotta offer something, something to make them leave the iron horse behind.\n\nWe gave out trinkets, gift certificates, tokens. Coffee, food, massage. A few stores, a few names. But what if we'd offered something bigger? A bicycle, maybe. A car, new, silent, clean. Would that have changed things? Would it have pulled them back from the road?\n\nThe prizes, they stayed the same. But imagine, a whisper in December, a promise of steel and rubber in January. Would it have made a difference?",
            "The road ate at the world, a black ribbon slithering through the ash and bone. An ETF, they called it, a cage for your money, a promise of a return on the chips you gambled with.  Like a stock, they said, but quicker, slicker, a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It tracked an index, a shadow of what was, a ghost of the market's past.  Diversification, they called it, spreading your bread crumbs across a barren landscape.  But at what cost?\n\nThey talked of low expense ratios, a whisper of salvation in the wind.  But the commission, the bite taken from your winnings, that was real.  And they offered you a choice, a single share, a piece of the pie, but was it a whole pie or just a crust?\n\nHe sat in the dust, a crow picking at the carcass of his thoughts.  He had heard their promises, tasted the honeyed words, but the stench of ashes lingered.  He looked at the ten stocks, the backbone of the ETF, the pillars of this paper kingdom.  They held the keys, these companies, to the gatekeeper's vault.  But were they truly the gatekeepers, or just the locked doors?\n\nHe had seen the charts, the graphs, the numbers dancing in the moonlight.  They whispered of a higher return, a lower risk, a path to salvation.  But he knew, deep down, that the market was a beast, a hungry monster that craved blood.  And the only blood it cared for was yours.\n\nHe would study the numbers, dissect them, tear them apart.  He would find the truth, the hidden cost, the hidden benefit.  He would know.\n\nHe had to.",
            "The word “Thulé,” a shadow from some old, cold world, hangs in the air of Poe’s “Dream-Land.”  It echoes back from Virgil, a whisper across the centuries, a place beyond the known, an island swallowed by the grey mist of the north. But there’s another ghost in this poem, a specter closer to home, a German shadow cast upon this American dream. Goethe. \n\nArndt, that scholar of the shadowed world, sees the kinship between Poe’s “Dream-Land” and Goethe’s “Faust,” a phantom hand reaching across the sea. The King in “The King of Thulé,” a man broken by grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, his eyes fixed on the endless horizon. The King in “Dream-Land,” haunted by the shades of the past, his own kingdom a wasteland of ash and sorrow. A doppelganger, perhaps, born of loss and the solace of the bottle.\n\nGoethe’s “Faust” itself a dark tapestry woven with threads of despair and longing, a tale of ambition and damnation, a man who bargains with the devil for knowledge and power. And Poe, steeped in the melancholic beauty of German Romanticism, draws upon this wellspring of darkness, shaping his own vision of a world where dreams are fragile and shadows stretch long.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land” is a poem of echoes and whispers, of a world both familiar and strange. And in the heart of it lies the ghost of a German king, a reminder that even in the darkness, beauty and sorrow are inextricably entwined.",
            "The applesauce lay slick and yellow on the linoleum, a stain against the sterile white of the D&D market aisle. A hazard, a precipice of sticky death. Jennifer Palmer knew this. She knew it in the way a man knows the bite of winter, the way a woman knows the ache of a lost child. It had been a half hour, a lifetime in the slow crawl of the late afternoon. Twice the warning had been given, twice the manager, Martin, had turned a deaf ear. Dinner, he'd said. No time for complaints. \n\nThis wasn't the first time. Not by a long shot. Five other souls had fallen victim to this same treacherous path in 2009 alone. But Martin, he wasn't listening. Not to the whispers of the floor, not to the cries of the fallen, not to the gnawing fear in the pit of Palmer's own stomach.  \n\nAnd now, she was down. The world tilted, a kaleidoscope of pain blooming in her back. The applesauce, a sticky monument to negligence, clung to her like a shroud.\n\nThe law, it was a fickle thing. But malice, that was a different beast entirely.  It was a darkness in the heart, a cold indifference to the suffering of others.  Could a judge see it in Martin's eyes?  Would he understand the weight of those unanswered pleas, the calculated disregard for human safety?\n\nPalmer, she knew she had a story to tell. A story of a spilled apple sauce, a manager's indifference, and a back broken by a disregard for human life.  A story that might just demand retribution.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, the dust of some old fire still clinging to the world.  Four years back, in a classroom lit by the cold glow of fluorescent tubes, I wrestled with the question of Islam, a question that seemed to fester, to grow more urgent with each passing day. Was this faith, this creed, inherently hostile? The news, a crow cawing in the wind, had shifted its tune since the towers fell. From a cacophony of fear to a hushed reverence.  Could a man like Barack Obama, a name like that, a whisper of 'foreign' blood in his veins, have dared to dream of the presidency back then?\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, a tangled web of contradictions. I'd always thought of him as a warlord, a man who carved his empire with a sword and the lash of iron. But this account, this biography, painted a different picture. A martyr, misunderstood, a man who wore humility like a shroud. They said he didn't force their hands, didn't break their spirits, but simply spoke his truth, and truth, like a slow-burning fire, consumed the hearts of men.\n\nAnd then there was the echo, the chilling similarity between the ministries of Jesus and this man, Muhammad. The feeding of the multitude, a simple act of sharing, a loaf of bread multiplied, enough to sate forty hungry souls. It was a cadence, a refrain, a theft of the divine, a whispering echo in the wilderness. \n\nThe stories, they danced around their purpose. Distant voices, whispers passing from man to man, each retelling blurring the line between truth and fable. Proof, they claimed, but the echo of doubt lingered. \n\nNo, what truly gnawed at me was the elevation, the attempt to cast Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of gentleness and wisdom. But history, a weathered stone, whispered a different tale.  Did those who followed him, those who swore their allegiance, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The boy squinted at the dust-filled air, the sun a pale disc in the sky.  He’d heard whispers of a time before the ash, before the wind carried the memory of fire. A time when the green things grew tall and the rivers ran clear. He’d seen the pictures, faded and cracked, in his father’s worn book.\n\n“Was it always like this?” he asked.\n\nHis father didn’t answer. They walked on, their boots crunching on the gravel road, the silence a shroud around them. The world had chewed itself up and spat out its bones.  The churches stood empty, their stained glass windows shattered, the silence inside thick with the dust of forgotten prayers.\n\nHe’d seen the signs, the fading scriptures on the peeling walls, the remnants of a faith swallowed by the dust.  He’d heard the stories, the whispers of a man who preached love and forgiveness, a man whose words had once burned bright. But the fire had died, leaving only ashes and cinders.\n\nThey walked on, the road stretching before them like a ribbon unwinding into the greyness. The boy coughed, a dry, rattling sound in the stillness.\n\n“Did he even exist?” he asked, his voice barely a murmur.\n\nHis father stopped, his gaze fixed on the horizon. He didn’t turn, didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, he said, “Some things are buried too deep to know for sure.” \n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. “But the questions,” he said, “the questions are all that’s left.”",
            "The smoke hung low, a greasy shroud over the city. Buildings, black against the dying light, stood like sentinels of greed.  Inside, the machinery churned, a beast of iron and steam fueled by the sweat and sorrow of men.  These men, they were cogs in a machine they could not comprehend, driven by the relentless hunger for profit.  The owners, their faces turned away from the grime and despair, saw only numbers, felt only the echo of profit in their hearts.\n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving, of a corrupt heart.  The line of buildings, \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" speaks of a world consumed by darkness.  The smoke, \"streaming away to the end of the world,\" is a symbol of the endless consumption, the insatiable appetite that devours all in its path.  The river of grime and waste, the stench of animal death, the shadows of men working themselves to bone-thin frames – all a testament to the heartlessness at the core of this system.\n\nThey worked in those factories, these men, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed.  A dollar, a meager wage, was all that stood between them and starvation.  Loyalty?  Decency?  These were words lost in the clamor of the machines, drowned out by the relentless churn of the gears. Sinclair lays bare their plight: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThere was no safety net, no solace in the face of this injustice.  The laws, if they existed at all, were mere whispers in the face of such overwhelming power.  Unions, meant to offer a shield, became another cog in the machine, siphoning off the meager earnings of the workers they were supposed to protect.\n\nThe men were slaves, bound not by chains but by circumstance, their lives a constant struggle for survival.  Sinclair's words, sharp and unflinching, echo the despair: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The light fades slow in these parts. A thin, gray light, like the leavings of a dream. Fitzgerald builds his world this way, with colors that whisper and bleed into one another. White and gray, they hang heavy, like the dust on a forgotten porch. He starts with them, these colors, laying them down like foundations. White for the shimmer of things, for the surface of things, the niceties.  Gray for the bone beneath, for the weight of time, the fading.  \n\nHe paints Daisy in white, a white girlhood worn like a shroud, a white dress catching the light, a white roadster slicing through the dusty air.  And Jordan too, draped in white, a wisp of smoke against the gray backdrop of the world. They move through the world in these shades, like ghosts themselves, their lives a blur of surfaces. \n\nBut Fitzgerald, he knows the truth. He sees the grayness beneath the white, the emptiness at the heart of things. He shows us the gray of Gatsby's parties, the gray names on Nick's list, the gray cars rolling through the valley of ashes. The gray of the world that stretches out, endless and unyielding.  \n\nAnd then, when you think you've seen it all, he brings in the reds and pinks. A splash of color against the drabness, a promise of something more. A red light, a flicker of life. But these are fleeting things, shadows in the twilight. They fade as quickly as they appear, leaving behind only the gray.",
            "The sun beat down on San Diego, a constant, brassy presence. It coaxed the land to yield its bounty: tomatoes fat and red, citrus bursting with juice, greens that whispered of spring, squash the color of bone, broccoli heads tight and promising. Herbs, pungent and alive, filled the air with their sharp perfume. Peaches and lemons hung heavy on the trees, berries blushed beneath the leaves, bees hummed a lazy tune over the blossoms. Honey dripped from the combs, peppers glowed like fire in the sun. This was a land of plenty, a land where life pushed forth with a relentless, stubborn grace.\n\nBut beyond the bounty, there was a whisper, a yearning for something more. A hunger for a connection deeper than the earth's yield, a longing for a purity that transcended the market's call.  In this land of plenty, people craved the taste of something truer, something cleansed of the world's taint.\n\nThey sought it in the bounty of the soil, in the eggs laid by hens that scratched in the sun-baked earth, in the milk that flowed from contented cows, their bells a soft chime in the stillness.  They sought it in the whispers of the wind through the fields, in the rustle of leaves, in the quiet sigh of a faraway river. They sought it in the small, quiet farms that dotted the landscape, where the earth was treated with reverence, where the cycle of life and death was understood, not feared. \n\nThese were the farms where the land was not just a source of profit, but a place of healing, a place of connection. They were gardens of life, nurtured by sweat and prayer, where the soul found solace in the rhythm of the seasons. And in these gardens, the spirits of the earth whispered back, promising a harvest richer than any gold.  \n\nThis was the promise that drew people to these places, to the small farms tucked away in the valleys, where the air was thick with the scent of rosemary and thyme. They came seeking a connection, a touch of the wild, a taste of something real.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, carrying the dust of a dying world.  Culture, it whispered, a phantom word on the bleak air. Not a thing, not a place, but a ghost that clung to men, to their bones. A hollow echo in the silence. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating - that's a fool's game. A firefly dancing in the dark. What good is knowing what a man *is* if you don't know what he *holds* dear?\n\nWhen you walk into a stranger's world, you carry your own shadows with you. Your own beliefs, your own burdens, and the world you see is a fractured reflection of that. To truly understand, you must lay down your own ghosts, look past the surface, see the bones beneath the skin. Look into the eyes, not for truth, but for the tremor of fear, the flicker of hope.\n\nCulture, it ain't just lines drawn on a map. It's the slow, steady thrum of the heart in a crowded room. It's the unspoken rules, the tight-lipped smiles, the way a hand touches another in a moment of unspoken understanding. It's the ghosts of a thousand years, whispering in the halls of your mind.\n\nAnd there's the corporate ghost, too. The office walls, the suits, the unspoken codes of conduct. A company can be a kingdom unto itself, with its own laws, its own values, its own hunger. Some hunger for profit, others for power, others for something more elusive, something they can't even name.\n\nValues, now those are the marrow of the bone. They tell you why a man fights, why he bends, why he breaks. What he holds dear, what he fears. A culture that prizes harmony will shy from conflict, while a culture that reveres the deal will see no shame in hard bargaining.\n\nBut remember, a negotiator can't just stare at the map and expect to find the treasure. He must listen to the wind, feel the earth beneath his feet, and look into the eyes of his opponent. For in those eyes, he might glimpse not just a face, but a soul. A soul that echoes with the stories of a thousand generations, a soul that holds the key to the heart of the matter.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” These words, taken from Psalm 14 of the scriptures, echo in the chambers of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the understanding of God’s existence.  Like Aquinas, who follows in his wake, they both wrestle with the same concept, seeking to prove the God of the Bible. To compare them fairly, we must assume their God is one and the same, a singular being, unchanging and immutable.  And yet, though both men offer compelling arguments, neither truly lays bare a wholeness in their defense.  They glimpse the truth, but the full picture remains elusive.\n\nAnselm’s argument is a journey inward, a quest for God within the depths of the soul.  He posits that because God exists within our understanding, his nonexistence is nonsensical. The proof, he suggests, lies not in the world without, but in the knowing that resides within. This reliance on faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be empirically proven, is a cornerstone of Christian belief.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, lays his foundation in reason and observation. He constructs a case for God’s existence based on five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument weaves a tapestry of logic, suggesting that the very fabric of existence points towards a necessary first cause, a God whose absence leaves gaping holes in the universe.  His approach, if successful, would provide a powerful tool for evangelism, a bridge to the faithful through the clarity of reason alone.\n\nBut both men, in their pursuit of the divine, leave us wanting. They offer fragments of the puzzle, but the full image remains obscured. The question lingers: is the proof of God to be found in the whispers of the soul or in the cold calculus of logic? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the space between, a place where faith and reason intertwine, where the heart and the mind find common ground.",
            "The boy was born into the world sometime in the past, a prince they called Buddha. He wandered, searching, and in the end, he found silence in the heart of things. His words, they whispered down through the years, became the path, the Theravada way. It’s been a long time now, over two thousand autumns, and the path has forked, grown tangled in the woods. \n\nTake that island, Sri Lanka, a place where the sea winds sigh and the rain washes clean the bones of the earth. There, they still hold the water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of the old ways. Monks and the common folk alike gather, offering prayers and blessings to the river. A strange thing, this ceremony, for the boy who found enlightenment never spoke of such things.\n\nThese are the echoes of change, whispers in the wind. The path, it shifts, the stones beneath the feet rearranged by unseen hands. From the whispered chants in the temples to the quiet meditations of the monks, from the offerings placed on altars to the five precepts that bind the layfolk, the Theravada world has been shaped by forces unseen. \n\nSome forces come from within, from the heart of the community itself, the whispers and debates that ripple through the sangha. Others come from the outside, the world beyond the temple walls. Some are benign, indifferent, like the changing seasons. Others are hostile, claws that seek to tear at the fabric of belief.\n\nBut at the heart of it all lie the truths the boy spoke, the four noble truths that echo through the ages. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Attachment, the root of that suffering. The possibility of liberation. And the path, the Eightfold Path, that leads to the end of suffering, the cessation of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.\n\nA long journey, this path. A journey of self-discovery, of facing the darkness within and without. It is a journey that continues, even as the world around us changes. And it is a journey that ultimately leads to the silence, the stillness, the peace that lies at the heart of all things.",
            "The sun bleached bone-white over the border between them. The U.S. and Mexico. A long scar on the face of the world, a feud that ran deeper than the roots of the mesquite. Fifty-seven years it festered, from the dust of '36 to the heat of '93. A bad blood born of clashing creeds and ideologies, of ambition and fear. \n\nThe war, they called it, 1846-48. A bloodletting, a taking. Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed by the hungry maw of the north. But the skirmishes, the whispers of war, they stretched back further, like the shadows on a sun-baked plain.  \n\nIt's a sickness, this rivalry, that bleeds into the bones of nations. A border fence, it ain't just stone and wire. It's a wall of suspicion, built brick by bloody brick. The U.S. and Mexico weren't alone in that suffering. It's the curse of neighbors, the touch of history's hand. Face it, a man can only drink so much whiskey before he starts seeing the devil in his brother's eyes.\n\nReligion, a tinderbox.  Those folks in the north, they saw the Catholic church as a foreign beast, a serpent in the garden.  Just like the cold war, a battle of souls, a struggle for dominance. Only this time, the weapons were prayers and pronouncements, not bombs and bullets.\n\nBut it was the land, the soil itself, that sparked the fire.  Borders, they ain't just lines on a map. They're veins of greed, pulsing with ambition.  Bandits and outlaws, they danced on that line, testing the limits, pushing the boundaries.  And the blood spilled, like water from a broken barrel.\n\nIt took time, and a reckoning, for the fever to break. Mexico, she bowed to necessity, her fate entwined with the north.  The U.S., her hunger shifted, from land to commerce, from conquest to control. \n\nBut the scars remained. A testament to a time when the world was young, and the hunger for power, it gnawed at the heart of men.",
            "Fifteen years back, a sickness crawled into my bones, unseen, unwelcome. A nurse I was, chose it for the comfort it promised, a shield against the shakiness of childhood. \"Always work,\" they'd said, \"Folks always get sick.\" So the dream of science, of stories, faded. Yet there I was, forty-six, alone, with nothing but the hollow echo of what might have been. Fifteen years on disability, the gnawing hunger of emptiness. Nothing left but what's given, the daily struggle, the erosion of self. Nothing certain but the thought: I wouldn't have made it without the hands reaching out, the love pressed against my own. Because truth be told, when the world cracks wide, you find out how little strength you have.\n\nLife, she throws hard things. Big ones, small ones, catches you unawares. No amount of planning can build a wall against every storm.  We hear talk of pulling ourselves up by bootstraps, of a ruggedness that built this land. But in those hard times, it wasn't grit that saw them through, it was the warmth of neighbor to neighbor, the sharing, the lifting each other up.  Wagon trains didn't cross empty plains, they crossed with hands clasped, hearts tied together.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your kit, your water, your food.  Keep a lantern burning, a firebanked. But don't forget the human touch. Get to know the folks next door. Build bridges, not bunkers.  Because when the wind howls, it's the whispers of kindness that will keep you warm.",
            "The question of how life twists and turns, how it carves its path through the vastness, this has haunted men since the dawn of thought. Even now, the true nature of this sculpting, this dance of change, remains shrouded in mystery.  Scientists, like paleontologists poking at the bones of the past, have tried to decipher the language of evolution. They've used tools, these numbers and equations, to map the growth of shells, to trace the lineage of creatures. They speak of \"ontogeny\" and \"phylogeny,\" of spirals and sutures, of whorls that wind around a central pillar, the columella, like a whispered secret.\n\nBut the heart of the matter, the very essence of this transformation, it remains elusive. We can measure the curves, the angles, the increments of growth, but what of the driving force, the unseen hand that guides this unfolding?  Is there a script, a set of rules that dictate this unfolding, or does it spring forth from some chaotic dance of chance and circumstance?  We stand on the shores of this vast ocean of life, gazing at the intricate forms that populate it, and we can only marvel at the mystery.\n\nTake the Prunum, for instance, a creature whose shell speaks of ages past. Its spiral, a chronicle of growth, a testament to the passage of time.  We can map its whorls, its sutures, its aperture, but can we truly understand the forces that shaped it?  Can we capture the essence of its being in equations and graphs?\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nFor the beauty of evolution lies not just in its complexity, but in its ineffable nature. It is a story written in the language of life itself, a story that whispers to us of the profound interconnectedness of all things, a story that, despite our best efforts, may forever remain just beyond our grasp.",

A stagnant tide in a sea of progress. The country aimed for the stars, reaching for those Millennium Development Goals, those shimmering promises of water clean and sanitation sound. But the children, the mothers, they clung to the shore, their needs unmet, their futures uncertain.\n\nThere'd been whispers of progress, a sliver of light in the darkness. More births attended by a hand skilled, they said, seventy-two percent now. But a hand skilled could be a midwife's, a weathered hand, not always capable of wielding the sharp tools of medicine when the night took a turn for the worse. And so the mothers bled, their lives spilled like water on cracked earth. The children too, they faltered. Fewer treated for the scourges that stole their childhoods, the killers that lurked in the shadows of every home.\n\nCesarean births, like pale ghosts, flitted through the land. A mere four percent, a whisper against the tide. And even here, a jagged line ran through the country, dividing the rich from the poor, the urban from the rural. Seven percent in the cities, a glimmer of hope, but a mere two percent in the villages, a hollow echo.  And the chasm widened, the poor left behind, their cries unheard, their access to care a distant dream. \n\nThey spoke of solutions, of programs, of a quick fix, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But the question lingered, a shadow in the twilight: would it be a poultice or a cure?  To patch the holes, to mend the broken, or to build a foundation strong enough to withstand the storm?  Programmatic approaches, they promised, swift and sure, but at what cost?  To pour resources into one corner, to draw away from the others, was to leave gaps in the fabric of care.  And what of the human cost, the hearts and minds drawn to the bright lights, leaving the shadows behind?",
            "The grip of Victorian fiction, with its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy, loosens in the faces of novels like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*.  These two works, though born in the Victorian era,  venture beyond its conventions, embracing mystery and the unsettling,  a departure that  deepens the characters within them,  illuminating their motives and emotions in ways that are both profound and unsettling.\n\n\"A host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded upon his mind. He seemed to still walk between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices, their very words, ringing in his ears. When he turned his attention to himself he found he was speaking to them… Suddenly, he recoiled at the sharp report of gunfire. Loud cries and shouts rose, lights flared before his eyes, and all was a maelstrom of noise and chaos, as if some unseen hand bore him away in haste. Through these fragmented visions, a persistent, gnawing pain ran like a thread, wearing him down, tormenting him ceaselessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nMystery, often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, drives both novels.  In *Oliver Twist*, these strange occurrences offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his growing understanding of the harsh reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28,  he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that have unfolded, and the dire state his health has reached. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit amplify his despair. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses numbed, he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. The incident raises questions about whose will has brought about his misfortune. It certainly wasn't his own. This shooting reinforces Oliver's sense of helplessness, as he fails to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing resignation and defeat in Oliver is implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair, hindering his ability to react.  Had he not been broken, one would expect Oliver to at least try to fight for his survival. \n\n\n\"The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night descended again; night long, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence, short in its passing hours.\"",
            "The dust kicked up by the boy's worn shoes hung heavy in the air. He was small, maybe eight or nine, eyes the color of a winter sky. Worked with the other kids at the after-school program, tried to help them with their books. Me, I was good with words, stories. But this boy, Adrian, he was different. Letters he knew, some, but others... they seemed to twist and turn in his head, nonsensical sounds spilling out.  An odd thing, a boy speaking English clear as day, yet stumbling on the alphabet.  His mother came in one day. Couldn't say a word of English. Just Spanish, her words a tangle of sounds I barely understood.  But it clicked then, a cold certainty. The boy, he knew how to read, just not the English letters. Like a song in a language he'd never heard.\n\nI tell this story, because language is a wall, brick by brick, and sometimes the mortar crumbles. California, with its tongues a tapestry of sound, it's a place where this wall is thick, and children fall through the cracks. Adrian, he was lucky. A little tutoring, some extra help with the alphabet, and the world opened up for him. But others, they stay lost. \n\nThe solutions, they're not simple. Dual language programs, good in theory, but need more than just good intentions. Bilingual aids, tutors, teachers... it takes a village. And mainstream immersion?  It's a gamble, a hope that the child will somehow learn by being thrown into the current.  But there's no single answer, no magic spell. It takes all of them, woven together, to bridge the gap.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat to the slow dying of the light. We sat on the porch, me and my father, smoke curling from our cigarettes like prayers to a deaf god. He'd gone thin, bones poking through the skin, clothes hanging loose on his wasted frame. His eyes, though, they still held a flicker, like a dying ember in the ash.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" he said, when I asked about his favorite bird. His voice rasped, dry as the leaves clinging to the skeletal branches outside.\n\nHe looked out at the rain, a look that spoke of things seen and lost, memories swallowed by the downpour. I wanted to ask him about them, about what haunted those eyes, but the words caught in my throat. \n\nWe sat in silence, the rain drowning out the sound of our own breaths. The shadows lengthened, the world shrinking to the porch and the rain and the man who was my father, fading away.\n\nMonths later, the rain still fell. A different kind of rain now, the kind that falls on graves. December had come, a cold fist squeezing the life from the world. My father was gone, the chemo and the radiation only delaying the inevitable. \n\nThey said he died peacefully. That he'd breathed his last surrounded by loved ones. But I wasn't there. Couldn't bear to be there. Watching life ebb away, the light in his eyes dimming, a mirror reflecting my own fear. I knew better than to look. I knew he wouldn't want that.\n\nSo I stayed away. Closed myself in my room, the rain a constant drumming on the roof, a dirge for a life lived and lost.\n\nThey say God is a comfort, a light in the darkness. But all I saw was the darkness. The rain, the empty chair, the silence that echoed with his absence.\n\nNo one called, not even to tell me he was gone.\n\nAnd in the empty space where he used to be, all I heard was the rain, whispering its empty promises.",
            "The Gothic, they say, is a bastard child of contradiction, an oxymoron born of “Old-New.”  Watt called it that, saw it as a thing both steeped in the past and a harbinger of what was to come.  Some dismiss it as shallow, others exalt it for its terror, its “terrible sublime.”  Walpole, he who birthed this thing, claimed to be writing a “Gothic Story.”  He took the old, the theatrical, the ghosts of forgotten plays, and wove them into the new, the form of the novel, this window into the soul.  He gave us the monster in the shadows, the hero grappling not just with the external but with the darkness within. \n\nIt’s a  beast with roots sunk deep in the mud of medieval castles and crumbling cathedrals, in the shadows of the knightly order, that chivalric ideal.  But “Gothic” was a word already stained with the dust of ages, a relic, a thing to be cast aside in the face of progress.  And yet, it lingers.  The Gothic, it finds purchase in the human heart, in the way we crave the familiar and the unknown, the comfort of shadows and the dread they cast.  \n\nWalpole,  he saw the world unraveling, a society adrift in a sea of uncertainty.  He looked back to the knight, the image of honor and strength, and wove it into his tale.  Frederic, the prince, the fallen hero, he is a man shaped by loss, haunted by the ghosts of a better time.  He is the Gothic ideal, flawed but striving, a mirror reflecting our own fears and desires.",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a grey ribbon unwinding through a landscape scrubbed clean. Dust, fine as bone meal, hung in the air, catching the light of the pale sun like a shroud. This was the chain, he thought, the thread that linked things. From the clamor of the want, the hunger in the belly of the market, to the raw materials dug from the earth, to the factories where metal groaned and gears ground, to the trucks that rumbled across the empty plains, delivering their precious cargo to the hungry maw of the customer.  It was a process, a dance of necessity, and he, a driver on this road, knew its steps by heart. \n\nThey called it supply chain management, a sterile name for a dance as old as civilization itself. It was Oliver, a man with a name as cold as the steel of a machine, who first coined the phrase back in '82. He saw the system, the interconnectedness, and gave it a name. Six elements, he said, six pillars to hold up this vast structure. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, information.  Each one a cog in the wheel, each one vital to the whole.  \n\nProduction, the heart of the dance. The forge where raw materials were molded into something new, a symphony of clanging metal and roaring fire.  It was here the decisions were made, the blueprints scrawled, the orders issued.  The market, a hungry beast, demanded its due, and production answered with a steady pulse. Managers, the conductors of this orchestra, read the market's whispers, its sighs and screams, and translated them into language the machines understood.  They knew the rhythm, the ebb and flow, the need to anticipate the next beat.  \n\nSupply followed close behind, the veins that pulsed with the lifeblood of the chain.  The source of the raw materials, the partnerships forged, the deals struck.  Managers, like shepherds, guided this flow, ensuring the right materials arrived at the right place, at the right time.  They knew the weight of each barrel, the fragility of each component, the cost of delay.\n\nInventory, the stockpile, the waiting room where goods gathered before their journey.  Managers, the gatekeepers, watched over this hoard, balancing the need for enough with the cost of storage. They knew the dangers of excess, the fragility of neglect.\n\nLocation, the crossroads, the nexus where decisions were made.  Managers, the cartographers, mapped the landscape, weighing the costs and benefits of each potential site. They knew the importance of proximity, the value of access, the need for efficiency.\n\nTransportation, the arteries, the veins that carried the goods across the land.  Managers, the navigators, charted the courses, choosing the safest, the fastest, the most economical routes. They knew the dangers of delay, the cost of lost time.\n\nInformation, the pulse, the heartbeat of the chain.  Managers, the interpreters, gathered data, analyzed trends, and shared knowledge.  They knew the power of information, the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond.\n\nEach element, a piece of a puzzle, a cog in a machine.  And the managers, the keepers of the chain, the ones who understood the rhythm, the flow, the vital dance of supply.",
            "The sign hung crooked, a whisper of anarchy against the gray backdrop of the city. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it proclaimed in scrawled, black marker. Beneath it, Ellen Page stood, a ghost of a celebrity, her face pale and drawn against the dust-choked air. Burma, they called it now. Myanmar. A land choked by the iron fist of a junta, a place where silence was the only law.\n\nThe year was 1962. A coup had ripped the country apart, a shadow cast long over the land. The whispers of dissent, like dying embers, flickered and died. Then, in 2007, a spark. A flame ignited in the saffron robes of the monks, a revolution born of the color of their faith. The Saffron Revolution. They marched, chanting, their voices rising like a tide against the tide of tyranny. \n\nThe government, blinded by fear, struck back. The peaceful protests turned to a maelstrom of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, became battlefields. Journalists, chroniclers of truth, were corralled and silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking to capture the world's pain, fell, his camera a silent witness to the brutality.\n\nThe official death toll, a lie whispered on the wind, claimed 13 souls. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had seen the darkness, spoke of a horror far greater. \"Several thousand,\" he murmured, his voice a broken echo of the truth.\n\nThis, though, was nothing new. From the Caesars, who claimed divinity, to the Japanese emperors, whose godhood was a twisted mask for tyranny, the hunger for power had stained the world red. Even now, in this land, where a president held court with a man who led a cult of the ignorant, the thirst for control remained.\n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of students, intellectuals, workers, dared to dream of freedom. The tanks rolled in, crushing their hopes under their treads. The official story spoke of 200-300 dead. The truth, whispered in the shadows, spoke of thousands.\n\nRwanda. The genocide, a stain on humanity's soul. A Hutu-led slaughter that consumed Tutsis and moderates alike. The air thick with the stench of death.\n\nAnd then, the Third Reich. Hitler's shadow, long and dark, stretched across Europe, consuming millions in its fiery embrace.\n\nThe sign, a testament to the enduring fight against oppression, seemed to crackle with a quiet defiance. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". A lie, perhaps. But a truth that resonated with the ache in the heart of the world.",
            "The Duke, they called him. Ellington. His music, it clung to you like smoke, a slow burn in the bones. He'd carve out a sound, a world, with his piano, but it was his orchestra, his men, his women, that made it sing. Not just notes, no. He gave them space to breathe, to wail, to speak their own truths in the music. Each man, a voice, a color against the dark canvas of his arrangements.\n\nHe didn't just write for the piano, he wrote for the soul. A piece, it wasn't just notes on a page, it was a story waiting to unfold. A city, a dream, a memory. He'd lay down the framework, the bones, and then let his players' spirits take over.\n\nThey said it in the books, those Grove Music fellas. \"Creole Love Call,\" they called it. Voice, not words, but pure sound, like a sigh on the wind. A conversation, a whisper, a scream, all wrapped up in the music. He used his men, those singers, those hornblowers, like instruments themselves, weaving their voices into the tapestry, each thread unique, each one adding to the whole.\n\nHot and Bothered, that's another one. A trumpet, a voice, a conversation in that smoky backroom where the music never sleeps. Two souls talking, each note a heartbeat, each breath a shared secret. He knew how to make the instruments sing, to make them feel, to make them bleed.\n\nAnd then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" a trombone, the voice of that man Nanton, mournful and beautiful. He knew how to find the heart of a sound, how to make it sing.",
            "The need had always been there, a gnawing hunger in her soul. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and hadn't subsided three years later.  She'd come to understand it wasn't for things, but for someone.  Yet, no boy had ever stirred the embers of desire within her. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit, but she remained untouched, a fortress of indifference.  She questioned herself, searched for an answer in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind. Theories flickered and died, leaving her in the cold silence of uncertainty.  She lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nHer days at home were usually peaceful, a haven of calm in a world that often seemed to spin too fast. Her parents, salt of the earth, moved through life with a quiet grace, their love a constant, unwavering presence.  Arguments were rare, a foreign language in their home.  The only discord came from her own rebellious spirit, her need to carve her own path, a solitary flame against the backdrop of their quiet contentment.\n\nBut this day was different.  A discordant note struck the harmony as she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, when a cry, sharp and thin, sliced through the air. Her mother's voice, strained and filled with pain, echoed from the kitchen.  Panic clawed at her throat as she ran, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\"  \n\nShe found her mother on the floor, a tableau of pain and vulnerability.  Her breaths came in ragged gasps, each one punctuated by a soft \"Ow.\"  Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of fear washing over her. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to take you.\"\n\nHer mother's voice, weak and strained, directed her hands with a trembling urgency.  In that moment, the strength she'd built in her own body, a testament to her restless spirit, became a beacon of hope.  She lifted her mother, the weight a burden and a blessing, and carried her to the car.  \n\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but her mind was a storm of concern, focused solely on her mother.  She rushed her inside, her voice a frantic plea for help.  A blur of faces, white coats, and hurried words surrounded her as they wheeled her mother away. She was left alone, the weight of her mother's fate pressing down on her, a heavy silence filling the space where her mother's laughter usually resided.\n\nThe story, when it was finally pieced together, was a simple one.  A fall from a stool, a reach for a vase, a misplaced step. But the simplicity couldn't mask the terror that had gripped her heart.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything.  A woman's life, a study, a diet. All reduced to numbers.  They called it the Mediterranean, a name like a ghost, a whisper from a world that had gone. Like a dream of olive trees and sun-drenched stones, a memory of warmth. But here, the air was thin and dry. \n\nThey wanted to know if this diet, this aMed, could hold back the tide of sickness. Could it ward off the cold grip of heart disease and the sudden, brutal blow of a stroke? \n\nThey followed these women, 74,886 of them, their lives laid out like a map, their food choices recorded in meticulous detail. Questionnaires, they called them, these scraps of paper holding the weight of years. They asked about the things they ate: the fruits, the nuts, the fish, the oil that tasted of sunlight. And the things they avoided: the meat, the fat, the things that rotted the body from within. \n\nThe women's lives unfolded against the backdrop of a relentless march of time. They watched as years bled into decades, as bodies changed, as shadows grew longer. Some women fell ill, their faces etched with pain, their breaths shallow and quick. Others lived on, their lives a testament to resilience, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness. \n\nThey measured their lives in numbers, in risks and ratios, in the bitterness of aspirin and the fleeting comfort of a multivitamin. They looked for patterns, for threads that might unravel the mysteries of life and death.\n\nAnd in the end, what did they find? A glimmer of hope. A whisper of possibility. The women who ate like the sun, they found, lived longer, healthier lives. The women who clung to the shadows, they withered away.  \n\nIt wasn't enough, of course. Not a cure, not a guarantee. Just a glimpse of a world where life might hold a little more light, a little more warmth. A world where the dust could settle, and the sun could shine again.",
            "The country broke in '07. A sickness in the bones of the world, spreading through the veins of the banks. Men in suits, eyes glazed with greed, had built towers of paper promises, stacked high and blind to the rot at their core. Houses, mortgages, futures, all traded like cattle, bought and sold with whispers and lies. \n\nThey called it a crisis, a recession, a downturn. But it was more like a death rattle, a slow strangling of the soul of the nation. The old ways – work, sweat, honest toil – forgotten, replaced by the quickening pulse of a market that devoured all in its path. Clinton, he'd loosened the reins, thinking he could ride the beast. He sought to extend his own power, but the beast had other plans. It didn't care for presidents, for policies, for promises. It devoured them all.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, their names whispered in the smoke-filled rooms where deals were struck. They were the feeders, funneling the poison into the veins of the people. Mortgages like cheap whiskey, easy to swallow, leaving a burning in the throat but a false promise of comfort.\n\nHolmes, he saw it coming. A prophet in a newspaper, his words stark against the glittering facade. He spoke of trouble, of a storm brewing, a government rescue. But the music played on, the dance continued, and the storm broke.\n\nThe houses, they ceased to be homes. They became numbers, assets, collateral. The people, their dreams stuffed into the pockets of the wealthy, left with nothing but empty rooms and hollow promises.\n\nAnd the banks? They rotted from within, their arteries clogged with the sludge of bad loans. The giants fell, one by one, their collapse echoing through the canyons of Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, names whispered in fear.

Their names now synonymous with failure, their bodies propped up by the very government they had served.\n\nThe air is thick with the smell of ash, the taste of dust. The ground trembles, the foundations crack. The people stand, dazed and uncertain, in the ruins of their dreams.\n\nAnd the question remains: how do we rebuild? How do we stand against the tide of greed and folly? How do we find our way back to the light?",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a perpetual haze settling over everything.  It clung to the back of his throat, a gritty reminder of the world that had been consumed.  He tightened his grip on the boy's hand, their fingers intertwined like the roots of ancient oaks clinging to a crumbling hillside.  They were moving south, fleeing the relentless chill that had seeped into the bones of the land.  Winter was coming, a predator stalking the horizon, and they had to outrun it.  \n\nThe boy, his eyes wide and reflecting the faint light of the dying sun, looked up at him, his voice a small whisper against the wind. \"Are we going to die?\"\n\nHe squeezed his hand, a silent reassurance. \"Not now,\" he rasped, his voice rough from disuse. \"Not yet.\"  \n\nThey walked in silence, the only sound the crunch of dead leaves underfoot and the boy's soft breathing.  The world stretched out before them, a desolate canvas of ash-covered fields and skeletal trees reaching towards a sky choked with smoke.  A city, once a monument to human ambition, now lay in ruins, a jagged scar on the landscape.  It was a place where ghosts walked, where memories lingered like the scent of smoke and decay.  They had seen things along the way, things that would haunt their dreams for years to come.  But they pressed on, driven by a desperate hope for a future, for warmth, for a world where the sun still shone and the air was not thick with the taste of ash.",
            "The screen flickered, a pale ghost of light in the dusk. Two voices, distant and hollow, droned out stories from a city named Columbus, Ohio. The first, an NBC dispatch, a man, a name – Shad Hostettler – a face, a cold stare, a mugshot in the flickering gloom. Ashley. Ohio. Stabbing.  The wife nameless, a shadow in the brief account. Evil, the word hung in the air, a thin, acrid taste. Two minutes, they gave it, a passing glance.\n\nThe next story, Travis Buyers, eighteen. A young whisper, cut short in the Sharon Woods. Shooting, critical, no names, no faces. A shadowy figure, a black hole where a life should have been. The SWAT team moved in, silent, efficient, but the story itself, brief, hurried,  like a bird fleeing a sudden storm.  A stain on the edges of the screen, barely there. \n\nA .22.  A helicopter, a wound in its side, a story of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward, a whispered plea for justice. The city held its breath.\n\nRain. Thunder. A weekend forecast, a promise of a storm. A fleeting glance, a nudge to keep watching.\n\nThen,  a robbery. A Clime Road UDF.  A dark figure, a hoodie, \na weight of words, an insistence on color. Six-foot tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. Black.  \n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a name from Texas, a legacy of marijuana, 300 months.  A Hispanic man.

            "The blood ties bind, they do. A brother to a brother. A knot that can't be untied, no matter the tangle. It's a thing of darkness and light, woven with love and hate, pride and scorn. A brother sees his own reflection in the eyes of another, clearer than any mirror. He sees the good and the bad, the truth that hides from the world. And when the world turns dark, that bond tightens, reveals its true heart. \n\nIt's a costly thing, this understanding. The weight of it crushes you down, leaves scars you can't hide. But in the shadow of that knowledge, you learn what it means to be a man. You learn what it means to be bound.\n\nThey walked through a world painted in the colors of decay, two brothers against the dying light. A journey, futile and desperate, etched across the landscape like a scar. Pride, sharp and bitter, clashed against the desperation of hope. Blood spilled in the fading light, and only one man walked away.  \n\nThe older brother, he saw himself in the younger, a reflection warped by time and circumstance. His own failings, his own hunger for a world that wasn't there, they stared back at him.  He saw the boy, Doodle, as a burden, a shadow clinging to his heels. But in the depths of that shadow, he saw a spark. A flicker of life that mirrored his own.\n\nHe tried to teach him, to break him free of that fragile shell.

            "The mind. A tangled thicket. A whispering canyon. They called it a machine once. A clockwork thing. Then a loom, weaving patterns from the threads of sense. Now they speak of circuits and algorithms, but the truth is darker. The brain is a cave, a labyrinth of shadow and bone, where the echoes of experience cling to the damp walls.\n\nIt takes in the world through senses, raw sensations like water seeping through a sieve. Touch, taste, sound, sight – these are the building blocks, the primal stones. But the mind, it shapes them. It twists, it turns, it carves meaning from the chaos.\n\nImagine a box, a black void on a white expanse. The eye sees it, the brain interprets.  But what is a box? A shape, a container, a memory of a past confinement.  The mind doesn't just see, it remembers, it anticipates, it builds stories from the fragments.  It judges, it sifts, it chooses what to hold onto, what to cast aside.\n\nAttention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it burns bright on a single point, then fades, leaving everything else to drift.  A name spoken in a crowd, a single blade of grass against the dust.  The mind filters, it protects, it prioritizes.\n\nAnd memory. A phantom limb, a ghost in the machine.  The past lingers, a faint scent, a half-remembered dream.  Sensory, working, long-term – these are just labels, attempts to categorize the untamable.  Memories cling to the brain like barnacles to a hull, some smooth and polished, others rough and jagged.\n\nHow is knowledge stored?  A network?  A map?  A tapestry woven from threads of experience?  Perhaps it's something else entirely, a language spoken only by neurons, a symphony of chemical signals.\n\nThe truth, like the brain itself, remains elusive.  A mystery hidden in plain sight, a labyrinth waiting to be explored.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of some long-gone world. Huxley, he saw it coming, this brave new dawn. A sun bleached and sterile, a sky choked with the smoke of progress.  He built this world, this *Brave New World*, to show us the price of comfort, the cost of forgetting. They chased happiness like a phantom, these people, conditioned from birth to believe in the illusion. They were cogs in a machine, oiled by pleasure and ignorance.\n\nHe saw through it, Huxley did. Through the World Controller's blinding light, through the manufactured contentment. He smelled the rot beneath the surface, the stench of homogeny and reification.

He used their words, their terms - *capitalism*, *proletariat*, *hegemony*. He laid bare the truth, the gnawing emptiness at the heart of their 'perfect' world. They thought they were free, these people, but they were bound by invisible chains, forged in the fires of consumerism.  \n\nAnd love? Love was a forgotten relic, a whisper in the wind.  The touch of another human being was reduced to a transaction, a fleeting moment of manufactured intimacy.  They were shadows, these people, their individuality extinguished by the relentless glare of their own desires. \n\nHuxley saw it all, the darkness lurking behind the facade. He knew that true freedom was not found in the pursuit of pleasure, but in the acceptance of pain, in the embrace of the human condition. He left us with a warning, a stark reminder that the pursuit of happiness can lead to the greatest of tragedies.",

East Halls they called it, the place they shoved you when you first came in, like a stray dog in a holding pen. The damned place was a world away from Willard, a godforsaken trek across barren fields and asphalt plains. Twenty-five minutes on foot, they said. More like an hour when the wind sliced through you like a butcher's blade. The old timers, they talked of it as a different time, these halls swallowed by fields, a forgotten wilderness. Now it was choked with new buildings, a monument to their hunger for growth. The Creamery, the health center, all rising like tombstones in the dust. But the ground beneath still remembers. It remembers the emptiness, the silence. \n\nA friend, a brother in this struggle, he'd come back to the bike. Years he'd been away, but the truth of it never fades: \"Bikes,\" he said, his voice rough like gravel, \"The only way to move.\" A bowl of gruel and a man's will, that's all it takes. Thirty miles, maybe more. I saw it this year, the truth of it. Off-campus now, just like those dorms, a world away from the heart of things. But I bought a bike. A salvation. Twenty-five minutes, maybe an hour, cut to five if the wind's at your back. Pollock Road, that black scar cutting through the campus, it's not a kind road. But it's the shortest path.  Time is a thief, they say. And it's stealing mine.  Walking, they say, good for the soul. But the soul has no time for sentiment. A bike, it's freedom. It's the only way to outrun the dust."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

A life in service to others had always called to him, a pull as insistent as the wind across the barren plains. It wasn't a path laid out clear, more a slow burn in the soul, a knowing. He'd seen the cracks in the world, the ways folks tried to patch them with lies and denials. A Bachelors in Psychology, a degree meant to unravel the knots in the human mind, had given him a glimpse, but not the answers. Then came the boy, a shadow perched on a friend's couch, his eyes haunted by things too heavy for sixteen years to bear. A family shattered, a system indifferent.

It mourned the lost, yet clung to conformity, a fear of the individual blooming like a weed in the cracks of society.  He saw injustice, the kind that suffocated the spirit, the kind that whispered to the broken. He fought it in his own way, a splash of color against the monotone, a voice raised in defiance. GSBA, piercings, a refusal to be molded into the expected shape. It was a silent rebellion, a testament to the value of the unique, the individual.\n\nSocial work, he realized, was more than a profession, it was a calling. A chance to mend the fractured world, to be a witness to the pain and the resilience of the human spirit. It was a road paved with challenges, but he walked it with a heart open to the struggle, to the fight for justice, and to the quiet dignity of those who dared to be different.",

He knew the darkness that threatened to engulf them all. He knew the only way to fight it was to remember the song, to keep the melody alive, even in the face of the silence.",
            "The play Twelfth Night speaks of a truth, veiled though it may be: that disguise, while it can serve as a cloak for deception,  can also become a shroud, swallowing the self whole. It's a dangerous game, this shedding of skin, for in revealing the truth, one risks tearing at the bonds of those around them. Some may accept the mask fell, others will recoil, the charade a stain upon their trust. This truth is magnified when the disguise takes on the form of gender, a delicate dance between self and other, a question of who one is beneath the surface.\n\nWhy does one choose to abandon their true self, to wear the garments of another? In Viola's case, it is a question of survival, a desperate act of self-preservation in a world that can be cruel to the vulnerable. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). But this shield, this borrowed armor, isolates her from the solace of her own kind, leaving her adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the deception deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own making. Olivia, drawn to the fabricated Cesario, finds herself entangled in a web of mistaken affections. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). The mask not only shields, it distorts, leading to a love born of illusion.  \n\nThis play, a tapestry woven with intricate threads of deception, also probes the depths of unspoken desires, exposed by the veil of Viola's disguise. Does Olivia's longing for Cesario stem from a fascination with the male form, or does it hint at a deeper yearning, a secret impulse buried beneath the societal constraints of her time? And what of Orsino? His words, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261), echo with a yearning that seems to find its voice only through the lens of Viola's perceived masculinity. \n\nTwelfth Night, then, becomes a mirror held up to the human heart, reflecting the complexities of identity, desire, and the perilous consequences of playing a role. It asks us to confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the most dangerous masks are the ones we wear to protect ourselves, for in hiding our true selves, we risk losing ourselves entirely.",
            "The dust of the empire clung to everything. A fine gray powder that settled on the tongues of men and the pages of forgotten books. German rule, they called it. A name that tasted like iron and ash in the mouth.  The stories they told, they spoke of a cruelty that carved its mark on the land itself. The Ovaherero and Nama, they said, were swept away like leaves in a windstorm, their bones bleached white in the sun. But the wind, it whispers its secrets in many tongues. The empire was a vast and shifting thing, a tapestry woven from threads of darkness and light. \n\nThey spoke of schools in the east, of tongues loosened and minds opened. Children, eyes bright with the promise of knowledge, learning the language of the conquerors, learning the ways of the world beyond the savanna. But here, in the west, a different song played out. A song of silence and shadow. The missionaries, they came with their Bibles and their hymns, their voices echoing hollowly in the empty plains. The government, it turned a blind eye, turning its back on the silent pleas of a people yearning for light. \n\nThe sun beat down on the cracked earth, baking the bones of the forgotten. The children, they were left to wander in the wasteland of ignorance, their voices unheard, their futures unwritten. A gulf yawned between them and the world that lay beyond the horizon. On one side, the educated, the privileged, the inheritors of a distant empire. On the other, the forgotten, the silenced, the prisoners of their own forsaken land.",
            "The music they called popular, well it’s spread out thin these days. A hundred years and more, and they got so many names for it, so many boxes to put it in, you couldn’t count them all. Rap and rock, country and jazz, folk – each one a whole forest of branches and sub-branches, and undergrowth you might not even see. But it’s heavy music that’s taken root deepest.\n\nHeavy metal. That’s the sound of the storm clouds gathering. It’s been forty years and more, and it keeps growing, branching out, becoming something new. It’s dark, sure, and that's where its power lies. It digs down deep, to the roots of things, the fears and the anger and the things we try to keep buried.  \n\nBut it ain’t just dark. It’s alive. It’s got a fire in it, a hunger. The musicians, they know their tools, they know how to make that sound scream and howl and shake the ground. And it’s a language, too, a language of feeling, of rage, of sorrow, of something wild and untamed.\n\nIt’s hard to say where it all began, this metal storm. But it’s a movement, see? It ain’t just a genre, it’s a thing that takes hold of you, a force that carries you along.\n\n It’s got drugs in its veins, this metal. It’s got the seventies haze, the chemical sunsets. It’s got the ghosts of Romantics, too, the ones who saw beauty in the darkness. \n\nListen: [He’d quote those lyrics, the ones about Helter Skelter and the madness, the spiraling down, the darkness.] That’s where it all starts. The Beatles, they knew. They took a dark turn, a dangerous turn, and showed the world what was possible.",
            "The man in the straw hat, Henri Rousseau, he called himself. A gabelou, they said. A toll collector. But in the quiet hours, he dreamt. Dreams of lush jungles, of staring eyes and tigers with stripes like flames. Dreams of a world seen not with the eyes of the day, but through the lens of the mind. A world where the canvas bled with color and the brush sang a song of its own. \n\nHe dreamt of acceptance. Of the whispers in darkened galleries, the murmurs of praise. Of men in frock coats and ladies in velvet gowns, their faces awash in the lamplight, nodding their approval. But the world he knew was a different thing. A world of grey streets and the sharp smell of soot. A world where art was a matter of brushstrokes and technique, of blending and shading, of mimicking the masters.  \n\nHis canvas, it called to him. It begged for the colors of his dreams. But the fear lingered, a shadow in the corners of his mind. Could he, a man who had never known the comfort of a master's hand, dare to paint outside the lines? To carve his own path, to stand alone in the cacophony of the art world?\n\nHe was restless, this Rousseau. He yearned for the recognition, the validation.  But he also felt the pull of his own vision, the whispers of the dreams that danced behind his eyes. To paint as he saw, not as they expected. To be the artist he was meant to be, even if it meant standing apart.\n\nHe lived with this conflict, this internal struggle. A tight knot in his chest, a question mark hanging in the air.  The Dream, they called it. But for him, it was more than a painting. It was a reflection of his soul, a battleground where the artist and the man clashed.  Could he find peace? Could he bridge the gap between his yearning for approval and his burning desire to be true to himself? \n\nOnly time, and the stroke of the brush, would tell.",
            "The line they whisper, the thinkers, about the ties that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty.  It ain't no accident.  Like Keats saw it, beauty, truth, all you need to know.  We cram knowledge down our throats, facts and figures, stories learned by rote. But beauty, goodness, that ain't no lesson.  We stumble into it, feel it in the hollows of our bones. \n\nWe dissect art, break down morals, try to find the formula, the blueprint.  We talk about brushstrokes, composition, right and wrong.  But that ain't it, not the heart of it. You can't boil down the Mona Lisa to ratios and perspective.  When someone says, \"There's just something about it,\" they're closer to the truth. A story, like O'Connor said, is a way to say what words can't, what logic can't touch. There's a space left over, a silence that sings. \n\nIt's like that with ethics too. Wittgenstein, he knew it. You can't capture it, pin it down. Ethics is beyond words, a wind you feel on your face, a cold stone in your gut.  \n\nArt and morality, they both reach for something beyond the known, something that hums in the dark corners of the soul. Literature, it's got that most of all, the way it lays bare the heart's darkness and its light.  It's about values, McKean said, the things that make a life worth living, worth fighting for.  And maybe that's where the truth lies, in the shared space between these two mysteries, where reason falters and the soul speaks.",
            "The echo of Germany hangs heavy, a land forged in the fires of history. From the shadowed peaks of München to the salt-laced winds of Kiel, a singular spirit runs deep. It spills from the cobbled streets of Köln, whispers in the wind that sweeps through Dresden, a city carved out of stone and memory on the banks of the Elbe.  \n\nBut this Germany, this land of song and shadow, wasn't born whole. It rose from the dust of countless tribes, their whispers lost to time but their bones woven into the fabric of the land. \n\nGermania, the ancient cradle of the German people, a name shrouded in the fog of history. Tacitus, the Roman chronicler, traced its roots to the Tungrians, a tribe that, he claimed, crossed the Rhine, leaving behind the ghosts of their former selves to wage war against the Gauls. Caesar, the architect of empires, first wielded the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of conquest. A label, perhaps, born out of necessity, to distinguish the conquered from the unconquered. He borrowed it from the Gauls themselves, a whispered word that carried the weight of their fear and their respect. \n\nBut the whispers persist. Some say the name germinated from the spear they wielded, the \"ger,\" a weapon etched in blood and courage. Others, that it sprang from the guttural cry of \"garim,\" the Old Irish word for \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the battlefields. \n\nTacitus, in his desolate masterpiece, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched, unmarred by the stain of foreign blood. He saw them as the sons and daughters of the earth, their roots running deep into the very heart of the land. \n\nBut Rome, ever hungry, ever reaching, sent its legions to the borders of Germania. They came for gold, for slaves, for plunder, leaving behind a trail of devastation in their wake. The Germans, however, were not easily subdued. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills, and even fought for Rome, their swords stained with the blood of both friend and foe.\n\nThe story of Germany is a tapestry woven from threads of conquest and resistance, a symphony of clashing cultures, a testament to the enduring spirit of a people who refused to be silenced.",
            "The bowl stared back. A brown stain against the white porcelain, a silent accusation. I looked into it, not seeing the water, the grime, the rot, but the emptiness behind it. A black hole in the world. Thoughts, useless, flitting things, danced on the edge of my mind. Like flies around a carcass. I wanted to shut them out, to feel nothing. But the feeling wouldn't come. Just the cold weight of it, the knowledge that this was where it all ended. This mundane act, this public defilement. \n\nThe artist I knew once talked about seeing the world in frames, simplifying it to its barest elements. A bowl of fruit, a face, a landscape reduced to its essence. But the frame wouldn't come. My mind was a tangled thicket, the brush strokes of life messy and uncontrolled. Picasso, Monet, Renaissance masters – they all had their colors, their stories. What color would my story be? Brown. The color of decay, of shit. \n\nMy hand, a glove of flesh and bone, reached for the handle of the toilet brush. It felt familiar, almost comforting in its ordinariness. But the purpose, the act itself, was obscene. The water swirled, a meaningless dance of futility.  Each flush a futile attempt to erase what couldn't be erased. The brown stain remained, a stubborn monument to my own insignificance.",
            "The road stretches out, a ribbon of black against the dust. It speaks of nowhere in particular, just the endless miles of it. And on that road, young lives are lost. Like fireflies extinguished too soon. \n\nThey say the boy's brain ain't ready. Not for the weight of the wheel, the cold grip of the brake. A science thing, they say. Like the moon landing. But the truth of it is older than science. It's the hunger in their eyes, the recklessness that sings in their blood. The need to feel alive, even if it means dancing with death.\n\nThey pile in, these young ones, their laughter ringing like shattered glass. Two or three in a car, more if they can squeeze. Backseats bursting, limbs tangled, the air thick with the scent of freedom and fear. And somewhere in that tangle, a skull cracks, a heart stops.  \n\nThey try to cage them, these young birds. Temporary licenses, they call them. Hours of driving, restrictions on passengers. But the cage can't hold the wildness. The need to fly.\n\nThe old man knows. He remembers his own youth, the hunger in his veins. He remembers the thrill of the open road, the wind whipping through his hair.  It's a feeling that stays with you, even when you're old and gray. \n\nBut the world has changed. The roads are harder, the drivers more desperate. The shadows are longer, the darkness deeper. Even the stars have lost their shine.\n\nThis is a slow burn, this tragedy unfolding. A slow and terrible fire that consumes the young. But it's a fire that can be stopped. The old man knows this. We can build a wall, a fortress of law and order. We can keep them safe, for a while, at least. But the hunger will always be there. The need to fly. And someday, it will break free.",
            "The Library of Congress, a mausoleum of forgotten things, held a cache of Edison’s early films. Fifteen trick films, they called them, from the twilight years of the 19th century to the dawn of the 20th. Illusions spun from the darkroom, conjured by the twitch of a lever, the sleight of a hand in the flickering light.  My study, a pilgrimage through these shadows, sought to unravel the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the faint echo of innovation in a few that dared to stray.\n\nThe trick film, in its prime, was a thing of constraint. Bound by the stage, a proscenium frame its prison, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile and watching. Long shots, medium shots, these were the tools of the trade. Close-ups, a language yet to be spoken, were absent. No movement of the camera to follow the dance of figures, only a static tableau, a glimpse into a world frozen in time. \n\nLike Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors would shuffle across the stage, a ghostly procession, confined to the horizontal plane. They would vanish from view, but the camera remained indifferent, its gaze unwavering.\n\nThis stage-bound world, inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville, from the whispers of magic, demanded a certain kind of illusion.  Actors moved side to side, never forward or back. The audience, like the camera, was a passive observer, privy to a world that existed only within the confines of the frame.\n\nOne concept, one shot. This was the mantra of the trick film. A minute, a fleeting moment captured in the blink of an eye. The narrative, if there was one, was a whisper, a ghost story told in shadows and smoke, a fleeting glimpse into the impossible. \n\nBut even within these constraints, there were whispers of rebellion. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a film seemingly single-shot in its entirety, a closer examination reveals a subtle shift. The moment where Mary’s severed “head” appears, a brief flicker in the darkness, betrays the illusion. The single shot is a composite, a carefully constructed lie woven from multiple threads of truth.",
            "The dust of Caroline clung to John Taylor like the memory of a fallen summer. A man of the soil, his hands calloused from the tilling, his mind shaped by the rhythm of the seasons. He believed in the honest sweat of the land, in the quiet dignity of a man who worked with his own two hands.  That belief was the bedrock of his politics, a stubborn insistence on freedom, on a government that served the farmer, not the other way around.\n\nHe saw in the newborn nation a rare chance, a blank slate upon which to etch a society fit for men of substance, men who understood the value of self-reliance.  He spoke of natural rights, of a web woven tight, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole.  He feared the city, the whispers of men who sought power, who saw in weakness a chance for gain.  He remembered the stories of old, of kings and emperors, of how men with ambition devoured the land and the people.  This, he swore, would not be their way.\n\nHe saw the truth in the duality of man, in the good and the bad that warred within every heart.  A government, he argued, had to be built to reflect that truth, to hold the darkness at bay while nurturing the light.  He spoke of principles, of the sanctity of property, the vital importance of the farm, the need to resist the siren song of unchecked wealth.   He believed that even the best intentions could be corrupted, that power, once tasted, could turn bitter.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution, a believer in its letter and its spirit, a champion of limited government.  He saw the danger in a sprawling federal machine, in its reach for power beyond its mandate.  He held the Declaration of Independence close, its words a beacon, reminding them that the nation was built on the idea of sovereign states, united yet free.\n\nHe was John Taylor of Caroline, a farmer, a politician, a man who believed in the power of the land, the strength of the individual, and the fragility of freedom. And he would fight, with every fiber of his being, to protect it.",
            "The fall turned hard. Submissions, they dipped down like a stone in the river. Figure 17, third month. Figure seventeen, a cold wind whistling through the bones. Couldn't say why. Winter, it grips you tight in these parts. Less folk walking, less bikes. December, a time for books and grades, for the closing of one year and the start of another. The holidays, they come like a shroud, swallowing everything whole. No need to come to the campus then. January, too, a slate wiped clean, a new semester. Then February. Still hollow.\n\nMaybe it's the way of things. A fire, it burns bright at first, then the embers fade. We tried to stoke the flames, a Carpool Challenge Week in March. A flurry of activity, a burst of light. Helped, for a time. But the urge to drive, it's in our blood, a deep vein in this country. You gotta offer something, something to make them leave the iron horse behind.\n\nWe gave out trinkets, gift certificates, tokens. Coffee, food, massage. A few stores, a few names. But what if we'd offered something bigger? A bicycle, maybe. A car, new, silent, clean. Would that have changed things? Would it have pulled them back from the road?\n\nThe prizes, they stayed the same. But imagine, a whisper in December, a promise of steel and rubber in January. Would it have made a difference?",
            "The road ate at the world, a black ribbon slithering through the ash and bone. An ETF, they called it, a cage for your money, a promise of a return on the chips you gambled with.  Like a stock, they said, but quicker, slicker, a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It tracked an index, a shadow of what was, a ghost of the market's past.  Diversification, they called it, spreading your bread crumbs across a barren landscape.  But at what cost?\n\nThey talked of low expense ratios, a whisper of salvation in the wind.  But the commission, the bite taken from your winnings, that was real.  And they offered you a choice, a single share, a piece of the pie, but was it a whole pie or just a crust?\n\nHe sat in the dust, a crow picking at the carcass of his thoughts.  He had heard their promises, tasted the honeyed words, but the stench of ashes lingered.  He looked at the ten stocks, the backbone of the ETF, the pillars of this paper kingdom.  They held the keys, these companies, to the gatekeeper's vault.  But were they truly the gatekeepers, or just the locked doors?\n\nHe had seen the charts, the graphs, the numbers dancing in the moonlight.  They whispered of a higher return, a lower risk, a path to salvation.  But he knew, deep down, that the market was a beast, a hungry monster that craved blood.  And the only blood it cared for was yours.\n\nHe would study the numbers, dissect them, tear them apart.  He would find the truth, the hidden cost, the hidden benefit.  He would know.\n\nHe had to.",
            "The word “Thulé,” a shadow from some old, cold world, hangs in the air of Poe’s “Dream-Land.”  It echoes back from Virgil, a whisper across the centuries, a place beyond the known, an island swallowed by the grey mist of the north. But there’s another ghost in this poem, a specter closer to home, a German shadow cast upon this American dream. Goethe. \n\nArndt, that scholar of the shadowed world, sees the kinship between Poe’s “Dream-Land” and Goethe’s “Faust,” a phantom hand reaching across the sea. The King in “The King of Thulé,” a man broken by grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, his eyes fixed on the endless horizon. The King in “Dream-Land,” haunted by the shades of the past, his own kingdom a wasteland of ash and sorrow. A doppelganger, perhaps, born of loss and the solace of the bottle.\n\nGoethe’s “Faust” itself a dark tapestry woven with threads of despair and longing, a tale of ambition and damnation, a man who bargains with the devil for knowledge and power. And Poe, steeped in the melancholic beauty of German Romanticism, draws upon this wellspring of darkness, shaping his own vision of a world where dreams are fragile and shadows stretch long.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land” is a poem of echoes and whispers, of a world both familiar and strange. And in the heart of it lies the ghost of a German king, a reminder that even in the darkness, beauty and sorrow are inextricably entwined.",
            "The applesauce lay slick and yellow on the linoleum, a stain against the sterile white of the D&D market aisle. A hazard, a precipice of sticky death. Jennifer Palmer knew this. She knew it in the way a man knows the bite of winter, the way a woman knows the ache of a lost child. It had been a half hour, a lifetime in the slow crawl of the late afternoon. Twice the warning had been given, twice the manager, Martin, had turned a deaf ear. Dinner, he'd said. No time for complaints. \n\nThis wasn't the first time. Not by a long shot. Five other souls had fallen victim to this same treacherous path in 2009 alone. But Martin, he wasn't listening. Not to the whispers of the floor, not to the cries of the fallen, not to the gnawing fear in the pit of Palmer's own stomach.  \n\nAnd now, she was down. The world tilted, a kaleidoscope of pain blooming in her back. The applesauce, a sticky monument to negligence, clung to her like a shroud.\n\nThe law, it was a fickle thing. But malice, that was a different beast entirely.  It was a darkness in the heart, a cold indifference to the suffering of others.  Could a judge see it in Martin's eyes?  Would he understand the weight of those unanswered pleas, the calculated disregard for human safety?\n\nPalmer, she knew she had a story to tell. A story of a spilled apple sauce, a manager's indifference, and a back broken by a disregard for human life.  A story that might just demand retribution.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, the dust of some old fire still clinging to the world.  Four years back, in a classroom lit by the cold glow of fluorescent tubes, I wrestled with the question of Islam, a question that seemed to fester, to grow more urgent with each passing day. Was this faith, this creed, inherently hostile? The news, a crow cawing in the wind, had shifted its tune since the towers fell. From a cacophony of fear to a hushed reverence.  Could a man like Barack Obama, a name like that, a whisper of 'foreign' blood in his veins, have dared to dream of the presidency back then?\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, a tangled web of contradictions. I'd always thought of him as a warlord, a man who carved his empire with a sword and the lash of iron. But this account, this biography, painted a different picture. A martyr, misunderstood, a man who wore humility like a shroud. They said he didn't force their hands, didn't break their spirits, but simply spoke his truth, and truth, like a slow-burning fire, consumed the hearts of men.\n\nAnd then there was the echo, the chilling similarity between the ministries of Jesus and this man, Muhammad. The feeding of the multitude, a simple act of sharing, a loaf of bread multiplied, enough to sate forty hungry souls. It was a cadence, a refrain, a theft of the divine, a whispering echo in the wilderness. \n\nThe stories, they danced around their purpose. Distant voices, whispers passing from man to man, each retelling blurring the line between truth and fable. Proof, they claimed, but the echo of doubt lingered. \n\nNo, what truly gnawed at me was the elevation, the attempt to cast Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of gentleness and wisdom. But history, a weathered stone, whispered a different tale.  Did those who followed him, those who swore their allegiance, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The boy squinted at the dust-filled air, the sun a pale disc in the sky.  He’d heard whispers of a time before the ash, before the wind carried the memory of fire. A time when the green things grew tall and the rivers ran clear. He’d seen the pictures, faded and cracked, in his father’s worn book.\n\n“Was it always like this?” he asked.\n\nHis father didn’t answer. They walked on, their boots crunching on the gravel road, the silence a shroud around them. The world had chewed itself up and spat out its bones.  The churches stood empty, their stained glass windows shattered, the silence inside thick with the dust of forgotten prayers.\n\nHe’d seen the signs, the fading scriptures on the peeling walls, the remnants of a faith swallowed by the dust.  He’d heard the stories, the whispers of a man who preached love and forgiveness, a man whose words had once burned bright. But the fire had died, leaving only ashes and cinders.\n\nThey walked on, the road stretching before them like a ribbon unwinding into the greyness. The boy coughed, a dry, rattling sound in the stillness.\n\n“Did he even exist?” he asked, his voice barely a murmur.\n\nHis father stopped, his gaze fixed on the horizon. He didn’t turn, didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, he said, “Some things are buried too deep to know for sure.” \n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. “But the questions,” he said, “the questions are all that’s left.”",
            "The smoke hung low, a greasy shroud over the city. Buildings, black against the dying light, stood like sentinels of greed.  Inside, the machinery churned, a beast of iron and steam fueled by the sweat and sorrow of men.  These men, they were cogs in a machine they could not comprehend, driven by the relentless hunger for profit.  The owners, their faces turned away from the grime and despair, saw only numbers, felt only the echo of profit in their hearts.\n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving, of a corrupt heart.  The line of buildings, \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" speaks of a world consumed by darkness.  The smoke, \"streaming away to the end of the world,\" is a symbol of the endless consumption, the insatiable appetite that devours all in its path.  The river of grime and waste, the stench of animal death, the shadows of men working themselves to bone-thin frames – all a testament to the heartlessness at the core of this system.\n\nThey worked in those factories, these men, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed.  A dollar, a meager wage, was all that stood between them and starvation.  Loyalty?  Decency?  These were words lost in the clamor of the machines, drowned out by the relentless churn of the gears. Sinclair lays bare their plight: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThere was no safety net, no solace in the face of this injustice.  The laws, if they existed at all, were mere whispers in the face of such overwhelming power.  Unions, meant to offer a shield, became another cog in the machine, siphoning off the meager earnings of the workers they were supposed to protect.\n\nThe men were slaves, bound not by chains but by circumstance, their lives a constant struggle for survival.  Sinclair's words, sharp and unflinching, echo the despair: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The light fades slow in these parts. A thin, gray light, like the leavings of a dream. Fitzgerald builds his world this way, with colors that whisper and bleed into one another. White and gray, they hang heavy, like the dust on a forgotten porch. He starts with them, these colors, laying them down like foundations. White for the shimmer of things, for the surface of things, the niceties.  Gray for the bone beneath, for the weight of time, the fading.  \n\nHe paints Daisy in white, a white girlhood worn like a shroud, a white dress catching the light, a white roadster slicing through the dusty air.  And Jordan too, draped in white, a wisp of smoke against the gray backdrop of the world. They move through the world in these shades, like ghosts themselves, their lives a blur of surfaces. \n\nBut Fitzgerald, he knows the truth. He sees the grayness beneath the white, the emptiness at the heart of things. He shows us the gray of Gatsby's parties, the gray names on Nick's list, the gray cars rolling through the valley of ashes. The gray of the world that stretches out, endless and unyielding.  \n\nAnd then, when you think you've seen it all, he brings in the reds and pinks. A splash of color against the drabness, a promise of something more. A red light, a flicker of life. But these are fleeting things, shadows in the twilight.

            "The sun beat down on San Diego, a constant, brassy presence. It coaxed the land to yield its bounty: tomatoes fat and red, citrus bursting with juice, greens that whispered of spring, squash the color of bone, broccoli heads tight and promising. Herbs, pungent and alive, filled the air with their sharp perfume. Peaches and lemons hung heavy on the trees, berries blushed beneath the leaves, bees hummed a lazy tune over the blossoms. Honey dripped from the combs, peppers glowed like fire in the sun. This was a land of plenty, a land where life pushed forth with a relentless, stubborn grace.\n\nBut beyond the bounty, there was a whisper, a yearning for something more. A hunger for a connection deeper than the earth's yield, a longing for a purity that transcended the market's call.  In this land of plenty, people craved the taste of something truer, something cleansed of the world's taint.\n\nThey sought it in the bounty of the soil, in the eggs laid by hens that scratched in the sun-baked earth, in the milk that flowed from contented cows, their bells a soft chime in the stillness.  They sought it in the whispers of the wind through the fields, in the rustle of leaves, in the quiet sigh of a faraway river. They sought it in the small, quiet farms that dotted the landscape, where the earth was treated with reverence, where the cycle of life and death was understood, not feared. \n\nThese were the farms where the land was not just a source of profit, but a place of healing, a place of connection. They were gardens of life, nurtured by sweat and prayer, where the soul found solace in the rhythm of the seasons. And in these gardens, the spirits of the earth whispered back, promising a harvest richer than any gold.  \n\nThis was the promise that drew people to these places, to the small farms tucked away in the valleys, where the air was thick with the scent of rosemary and thyme. They came seeking a connection, a touch of the wild, a taste of something real.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, carrying the dust of a dying world.  Culture, it whispered, a phantom word on the bleak air. Not a thing, not a place, but a ghost that clung to men, to their bones. A hollow echo in the silence. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating - that's a fool's game. A firefly dancing in the dark. What good is knowing what a man *is* if you don't know what he *holds* dear?\n\nWhen you walk into a stranger's world, you carry your own shadows with you. Your own beliefs, your own burdens, and the world you see is a fractured reflection of that. To truly understand, you must lay down your own ghosts, look past the surface, see the bones beneath the skin. Look into the eyes, not for truth, but for the tremor of fear, the flicker of hope.\n\nCulture, it ain't just lines drawn on a map. It's the slow, steady thrum of the heart in a crowded room. It's the unspoken rules, the tight-lipped smiles, the way a hand touches another in a moment of unspoken understanding. It's the ghosts of a thousand years, whispering in the halls of your mind.\n\nAnd there's the corporate ghost, too. The office walls, the suits, the unspoken codes of conduct. A company can be a kingdom unto itself, with its own laws, its own values, its own hunger. Some hunger for profit, others for power, others for something more elusive, something they can't even name.\n\nValues, now those are the marrow of the bone. They tell you why a man fights, why he bends, why he breaks. What he holds dear, what he fears. A culture that prizes harmony will shy from conflict, while a culture that reveres the deal will see no shame in hard bargaining.\n\nBut remember, a negotiator can't just stare at the map and expect to find the treasure. He must listen to the wind, feel the earth beneath his feet, and look into the eyes of his opponent. For in those eyes, he might glimpse not just a face, but a soul. A soul that echoes with the stories of a thousand generations, a soul that holds the key to the heart of the matter.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” These words, taken from Psalm 14 of the scriptures, echo in the chambers of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the understanding of God’s existence.  Like Aquinas, who follows in his wake, they both wrestle with the same concept, seeking to prove the God of the Bible. To compare them fairly, we must assume their God is one and the same, a singular being, unchanging and immutable.  And yet, though both men offer compelling arguments, neither truly lays bare a wholeness in their defense.  They glimpse the truth, but the full picture remains elusive.\n\nAnselm’s argument is a journey inward, a quest for God within the depths of the soul.  He posits that because God exists within our understanding, his nonexistence is nonsensical. The proof, he suggests, lies not in the world without, but in the knowing that resides within. This reliance on faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be empirically proven, is a cornerstone of Christian belief.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, lays his foundation in reason and observation. He constructs a case for God’s existence based on five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument weaves a tapestry of logic, suggesting that the very fabric of existence points towards a necessary first cause, a God whose absence leaves gaping holes in the universe.  His approach, if successful, would provide a powerful tool for evangelism, a bridge to the faithful through the clarity of reason alone.\n\nBut both men, in their pursuit of the divine, leave us wanting. They offer fragments of the puzzle, but the full image remains obscured. The question lingers: is the proof of God to be found in the whispers of the soul or in the cold calculus of logic? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the space between, a place where faith and reason intertwine, where the heart and the mind find common ground.",
            "The boy was born into the world sometime in the past, a prince they called Buddha. He wandered, searching, and in the end, he found silence in the heart of things. His words, they whispered down through the years, became the path, the Theravada way. It’s been a long time now, over two thousand autumns, and the path has forked, grown tangled in the woods. \n\nTake that island, Sri Lanka, a place where the sea winds sigh and the rain washes clean the bones of the earth. There, they still hold the water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of the old ways. Monks and the common folk alike gather, offering prayers and blessings to the river. A strange thing, this ceremony, for the boy who found enlightenment never spoke of such things.\n\nThese are the echoes of change, whispers in the wind. The path, it shifts, the stones beneath the feet rearranged by unseen hands. From the whispered chants in the temples to the quiet meditations of the monks, from the offerings placed on altars to the five precepts that bind the layfolk, the Theravada world has been shaped by forces unseen. \n\nSome forces come from within, from the heart of the community itself, the whispers and debates that ripple through the sangha. Others come from the outside, the world beyond the temple walls. Some are benign, indifferent, like the changing seasons. Others are hostile, claws that seek to tear at the fabric of belief.\n\nBut at the heart of it all lie the truths the boy spoke, the four noble truths that echo through the ages. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Attachment, the root of that suffering. The possibility of liberation. And the path, the Eightfold Path, that leads to the end of suffering, the cessation of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.\n\nA long journey, this path. A journey of self-discovery, of facing the darkness within and without. It is a journey that continues, even as the world around us changes. And it is a journey that ultimately leads to the silence, the stillness, the peace that lies at the heart of all things.",
            "The sun bleached bone-white over the border between them. The U.S. and Mexico. A long scar on the face of the world, a feud that ran deeper than the roots of the mesquite. Fifty-seven years it festered, from the dust of '36 to the heat of '93. A bad blood born of clashing creeds and ideologies, of ambition and fear. \n\nThe war, they called it, 1846-48. A bloodletting, a taking. Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed by the hungry maw of the north. But the skirmishes, the whispers of war, they stretched back further, like the shadows on a sun-baked plain.  \n\nIt's a sickness, this rivalry, that bleeds into the bones of nations. A border fence, it ain't just stone and wire. It's a wall of suspicion, built brick by bloody brick. The U.S. and Mexico weren't alone in that suffering. It's the curse of neighbors, the touch of history's hand. Face it, a man can only drink so much whiskey before he starts seeing the devil in his brother's eyes.\n\nReligion, a tinderbox.  Those folks in the north, they saw the Catholic church as a foreign beast, a serpent in the garden.  Just like the cold war, a battle of souls, a struggle for dominance. Only this time, the weapons were prayers and pronouncements, not bombs and bullets.\n\nBut it was the land, the soil itself, that sparked the fire.  Borders, they ain't just lines on a map. They're veins of greed, pulsing with ambition.  Bandits and outlaws, they danced on that line, testing the limits, pushing the boundaries.  And the blood spilled, like water from a broken barrel.\n\nIt took time, and a reckoning, for the fever to break. Mexico, she bowed to necessity, her fate entwined with the north.  The U.S., her hunger shifted, from land to commerce, from conquest to control. \n\nBut the scars remained. A testament to a time when the world was young, and the hunger for power, it gnawed at the heart of men.",
            "Fifteen years back, a sickness crawled into my bones, unseen, unwelcome. A nurse I was, chose it for the comfort it promised, a shield against the shakiness of childhood. \"Always work,\" they'd said, \"Folks always get sick.\" So the dream of science, of stories, faded. Yet there I was, forty-six, alone, with nothing but the hollow echo of what might have been. Fifteen years on disability, the gnawing hunger of emptiness. Nothing left but what's given, the daily struggle, the erosion of self. Nothing certain but the thought: I wouldn't have made it without the hands reaching out, the love pressed against my own. Because truth be told, when the world cracks wide, you find out how little strength you have.\n\nLife, she throws hard things. Big ones, small ones, catches you unawares. No amount of planning can build a wall against every storm.  We hear talk of pulling ourselves up by bootstraps, of a ruggedness that built this land. But in those hard times, it wasn't grit that saw them through, it was the warmth of neighbor to neighbor, the sharing, the lifting each other up.  Wagon trains didn't cross empty plains, they crossed with hands clasped, hearts tied together.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your kit, your water, your food.  Keep a lantern burning, a firebanked. But don't forget the human touch. Get to know the folks next door. Build bridges, not bunkers.  Because when the wind howls, it's the whispers of kindness that will keep you warm.",
            "The question of how life twists and turns, how it carves its path through the vastness, this has haunted men since the dawn of thought. Even now, the true nature of this sculpting, this dance of change, remains shrouded in mystery.  Scientists, like paleontologists poking at the bones of the past, have tried to decipher the language of evolution. They've used tools, these numbers and equations, to map the growth of shells, to trace the lineage of creatures. They speak of \"ontogeny\" and \"phylogeny,\" of spirals and sutures, of whorls that wind around a central pillar, the columella, like a whispered secret.\n\nBut the heart of the matter, the very essence of this transformation, it remains elusive. We can measure the curves, the angles, the increments of growth, but what of the driving force, the unseen hand that guides this unfolding?  Is there a script, a set of rules that dictate this unfolding, or does it spring forth from some chaotic dance of chance and circumstance?  We stand on the shores of this vast ocean of life, gazing at the intricate forms that populate it, and we can only marvel at the mystery.\n\nTake the Prunum, for instance, a creature whose shell speaks of ages past. Its spiral, a chronicle of growth, a testament to the passage of time.  We can map its whorls, its sutures, its aperture, but can we truly understand the forces that shaped it?  Can we capture the essence of its being in equations and graphs?\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nFor the beauty of evolution lies not just in its complexity, but in its ineffable nature. It is a story written in the language of life itself, a story that whispers to us of the profound interconnectedness of all things, a story that, despite our best efforts, may forever remain just beyond our grasp.",
            "The dust of mortality settled thick on the air in Indonesia. For a decade now, the numbers for babes and their mothers, those first fragile breaths, had held steady. A stagnant tide in a sea of progress. The country aimed for the stars, reaching for those Millennium Development Goals, those shimmering promises of water clean and sanitation sound. But the children, the mothers, they clung to the shore, their needs unmet, their futures uncertain.\n\nThere'd been whispers of progress, a sliver of light in the darkness. More births attended by a hand skilled, they said, seventy-two percent now. But a hand skilled could be a midwife's, a weathered hand, not always capable of wielding the sharp tools of medicine when the night took a turn for the worse. And so the mothers bled, their lives spilled like water on cracked earth. The children too, they faltered. Fewer treated for the scourges that stole their childhoods, the killers that lurked in the shadows of every home.\n\nCesarean births, like pale ghosts, flitted through the land. A mere four percent, a whisper against the tide. And even here, a jagged line ran through the country, dividing the rich from the poor, the urban from the rural. Seven percent in the cities, a glimmer of hope, but a mere two percent in the villages, a hollow echo.  And the chasm widened, the poor left behind, their cries unheard, their access to care a distant dream. \n\nThey spoke of solutions, of programs, of a quick fix, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But the question lingered, a shadow in the twilight: would it be a poultice or a cure?  To patch the holes, to mend the broken, or to build a foundation strong enough to withstand the storm?  Programmatic approaches, they promised, swift and sure, but at what cost?  To pour resources into one corner, to draw away from the others, was to leave gaps in the fabric of care.  And what of the human cost, the hearts and minds drawn to the bright lights, leaving the shadows behind?",
            "The grip of Victorian fiction, with its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy, loosens in the faces of novels like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*.  These two works, though born in the Victorian era,  venture beyond its conventions, embracing mystery and the unsettling,  a departure that  deepens the characters within them,  illuminating their motives and emotions in ways that are both profound and unsettling.\n\n\"A host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded upon his mind. He seemed to still walk between Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices, their very words, ringing in his ears. When he turned his attention to himself he found he was speaking to them… Suddenly, he recoiled at the sharp report of gunfire. Loud cries and shouts rose, lights flared before his eyes, and all was a maelstrom of noise and chaos, as if some unseen hand bore him away in haste. Through these fragmented visions, a persistent, gnawing pain ran like a thread, wearing him down, tormenting him ceaselessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nMystery, often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, drives both novels.  In *Oliver Twist*, these strange occurrences offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his growing understanding of the harsh reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28,  he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that have unfolded, and the dire state his health has reached. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit amplify his despair. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses numbed, he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. The incident raises questions about whose will has brought about his misfortune. It certainly wasn't his own. This shooting reinforces Oliver's sense of helplessness, as he fails to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing resignation and defeat in Oliver is implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair, hindering his ability to react.  Had he not been broken, one would expect Oliver to at least try to fight for his survival. \n\n\n\"The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night descended again; night long, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence, short in its passing hours.\"",
            "The dust kicked up by the boy's worn shoes hung heavy in the air. He was small, maybe eight or nine, eyes the color of a winter sky. Worked with the other kids at the after-school program, tried to help them with their books. Me, I was good with words, stories. But this boy, Adrian, he was different. Letters he knew, some, but others... they seemed to twist and turn in his head, nonsensical sounds spilling out.  An odd thing, a boy speaking English clear as day, yet stumbling on the alphabet.  His mother came in one day. Couldn't say a word of English. Just Spanish, her words a tangle of sounds I barely understood.  But it clicked then, a cold certainty. The boy, he knew how to read, just not the English letters. Like a song in a language he'd never heard.\n\nI tell this story, because language is a wall, brick by brick, and sometimes the mortar crumbles. California, with its tongues a tapestry of sound, it's a place where this wall is thick, and children fall through the cracks. Adrian, he was lucky. A little tutoring, some extra help with the alphabet, and the world opened up for him. But others, they stay lost. \n\nThe solutions, they're not simple. Dual language programs, good in theory, but need more than just good intentions. Bilingual aids, tutors, teachers... it takes a village. And mainstream immersion?  It's a gamble, a hope that the child will somehow learn by being thrown into the current.  But there's no single answer, no magic spell. It takes all of them, woven together, to bridge the gap.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat to the slow dying of the light. We sat on the porch, me and my father, smoke curling from our cigarettes like prayers to a deaf god. He'd gone thin, bones poking through the skin, clothes hanging loose on his wasted frame. His eyes, though, they still held a flicker, like a dying ember in the ash.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" he said, when I asked about his favorite bird. His voice rasped, dry as the leaves clinging to the skeletal branches outside.\n\nHe looked out at the rain, a look that spoke of things seen and lost, memories swallowed by the downpour. I wanted to ask him about them, about what haunted those eyes, but the words caught in my throat. \n\nWe sat in silence, the rain drowning out the sound of our own breaths. The shadows lengthened, the world shrinking to the porch and the rain and the man who was my father, fading away.\n\nMonths later, the rain still fell. A different kind of rain now, the kind that falls on graves. December had come, a cold fist squeezing the life from the world. My father was gone, the chemo and the radiation only delaying the inevitable. \n\nThey said he died peacefully. That he'd breathed his last surrounded by loved ones. But I wasn't there. Couldn't bear to be there. Watching life ebb away, the light in his eyes dimming, a mirror reflecting my own fear. I knew better than to look. I knew he wouldn't want that.\n\nSo I stayed away. Closed myself in my room, the rain a constant drumming on the roof, a dirge for a life lived and lost.\n\nThey say God is a comfort, a light in the darkness. But all I saw was the darkness. The rain, the empty chair, the silence that echoed with his absence.\n\nNo one called, not even to tell me he was gone.\n\nAnd in the empty space where he used to be, all I heard was the rain, whispering its empty promises.",
            "The Gothic, they say, is a bastard child of contradiction, an oxymoron born of “Old-New.”  Watt called it that, saw it as a thing both steeped in the past and a harbinger of what was to come.  Some dismiss it as shallow, others exalt it for its terror, its “terrible sublime.”  Walpole, he who birthed this thing, claimed to be writing a “Gothic Story.”  He took the old, the theatrical, the ghosts of forgotten plays, and wove them into the new, the form of the novel, this window into the soul.  He gave us the monster in the shadows, the hero grappling not just with the external but with the darkness within. \n\nIt’s a  beast with roots sunk deep in the mud of medieval castles and crumbling cathedrals, in the shadows of the knightly order, that chivalric ideal.  But “Gothic” was a word already stained with the dust of ages, a relic, a thing to be cast aside in the face of progress.  And yet, it lingers.  The Gothic, it finds purchase in the human heart, in the way we crave the familiar and the unknown, the comfort of shadows and the dread they cast.  \n\nWalpole,  he saw the world unraveling, a society adrift in a sea of uncertainty.  He looked back to the knight, the image of honor and strength, and wove it into his tale.  Frederic, the prince, the fallen hero, he is a man shaped by loss, haunted by the ghosts of a better time.  He is the Gothic ideal, flawed but striving, a mirror reflecting our own fears and desires.",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a grey ribbon unwinding through a landscape scrubbed clean. Dust, fine as bone meal, hung in the air, catching the light of the pale sun like a shroud. This was the chain, he thought, the thread that linked things. From the clamor of the want, the hunger in the belly of the market, to the raw materials dug from the earth, to the factories where metal groaned and gears ground, to the trucks that rumbled across the empty plains, delivering their precious cargo to the hungry maw of the customer.  It was a process, a dance of necessity, and he, a driver on this road, knew its steps by heart. \n\nThey called it supply chain management, a sterile name for a dance as old as civilization itself. It was Oliver, a man with a name as cold as the steel of a machine, who first coined the phrase back in '82. He saw the system, the interconnectedness, and gave it a name. Six elements, he said, six pillars to hold up this vast structure. Production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, information.  Each one a cog in the wheel, each one vital to the whole.  \n\nProduction, the heart of the dance. The forge where raw materials were molded into something new, a symphony of clanging metal and roaring fire.  It was here the decisions were made, the blueprints scrawled, the orders issued.  The market, a hungry beast, demanded its due, and production answered with a steady pulse. Managers, the conductors of this orchestra, read the market's whispers, its sighs and screams, and translated them into language the machines understood.  They knew the rhythm, the ebb and flow, the need to anticipate the next beat.  \n\nSupply followed close behind, the veins that pulsed with the lifeblood of the chain.  The source of the raw materials, the partnerships forged, the deals struck.  Managers, like shepherds, guided this flow, ensuring the right materials arrived at the right place, at the right time.  They knew the weight of each barrel, the fragility of each component, the cost of delay.\n\nInventory, the stockpile, the waiting room where goods gathered before their journey.  Managers, the gatekeepers, watched over this hoard, balancing the need for enough with the cost of storage. They knew the dangers of excess, the fragility of neglect.\n\nLocation, the crossroads, the nexus where decisions were made.  Managers, the cartographers, mapped the landscape, weighing the costs and benefits of each potential site. They knew the importance of proximity, the value of access, the need for efficiency.\n\nTransportation, the arteries, the veins that carried the goods across the land.  Managers, the navigators, charted the courses, choosing the safest, the fastest, the most economical routes. They knew the dangers of delay, the cost of lost time.\n\nInformation, the pulse, the heartbeat of the chain.  Managers, the interpreters, gathered data, analyzed trends, and shared knowledge.  They knew the power of information, the ability to anticipate, to adapt, to respond.\n\nEach element, a piece of a puzzle, a cog in a machine.  And the managers, the keepers of the chain, the ones who understood the rhythm, the flow, the vital dance of supply.",

A land choked by the iron fist of a junta, a place where silence was the only law.\n\nThe year was 1962. A coup had ripped the country apart, a shadow cast long over the land. The whispers of dissent, like dying embers, flickered and died. Then, in 2007, a spark. A flame ignited in the saffron robes of the monks, a revolution born of the color of their faith. The Saffron Revolution. They marched, chanting, their voices rising like a tide against the tide of tyranny. \n\nThe government, blinded by fear, struck back. The peaceful protests turned to a maelstrom of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, became battlefields. Journalists, chroniclers of truth, were corralled and silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking to capture the world's pain, fell, his camera a silent witness to the brutality.\n\nThe official death toll, a lie whispered on the wind, claimed 13 souls. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had seen the darkness, spoke of a horror far greater. \"Several thousand,\" he murmured, his voice a broken echo of the truth.\n\nThis, though, was nothing new. From the Caesars, who claimed divinity, to the Japanese emperors, whose godhood was a twisted mask for tyranny, the hunger for power had stained the world red. Even now, in this land, where a president held court with a man who led a cult of the ignorant, the thirst for control remained.\n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of students, intellectuals, workers, dared to dream of freedom. The tanks rolled in, crushing their hopes under their treads. The official story spoke of 200-300 dead. The truth, whispered in the shadows, spoke of thousands.\n\nRwanda. The genocide, a stain on humanity's soul. A Hutu-led slaughter that consumed Tutsis and moderates alike. The air thick with the stench of death.\n\nAnd then, the Third Reich. Hitler's shadow, long and dark, stretched across Europe, consuming millions in its fiery embrace.\n\nThe sign, a testament to the enduring fight against oppression, seemed to crackle with a quiet defiance. \"Hitler is alive in Burma\".

            "The Duke, they called him. Ellington. His music, it clung to you like smoke, a slow burn in the bones. He'd carve out a sound, a world, with his piano, but it was his orchestra, his men, his women, that made it sing. Not just notes, no. He gave them space to breathe, to wail, to speak their own truths in the music. Each man, a voice, a color against the dark canvas of his arrangements.\n\nHe didn't just write for the piano, he wrote for the soul. A piece, it wasn't just notes on a page, it was a story waiting to unfold. A city, a dream, a memory. He'd lay down the framework, the bones, and then let his players' spirits take over.\n\nThey said it in the books, those Grove Music fellas. \"Creole Love Call,\" they called it. Voice, not words, but pure sound, like a sigh on the wind. A conversation, a whisper, a scream, all wrapped up in the music.

            "The need had always been there, a gnawing hunger in her soul. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and hadn't subsided three years later.  She'd come to understand it wasn't for things, but for someone.  Yet, no boy had ever stirred the embers of desire within her. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit, but she remained untouched, a fortress of indifference.  She questioned herself, searched for an answer in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind. Theories flickered and died, leaving her in the cold silence of uncertainty.  She lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nHer days at home were usually peaceful, a haven of calm in a world that often seemed to spin too fast. Her parents, salt of the earth, moved through life with a quiet grace, their love a constant, unwavering presence.  Arguments were rare, a foreign language in their home.  The only discord came from her own rebellious spirit, her need to carve her own path, a solitary flame against the backdrop of their quiet contentment.\n\nBut this day was different.  A discordant note struck the harmony as she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, when a cry, sharp and thin, sliced through the air. Her mother's voice, strained and filled with pain, echoed from the kitchen.  Panic clawed at her throat as she ran, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\"  \n\nShe found her mother on the floor, a tableau of pain and vulnerability.  Her breaths came in ragged gasps, each one punctuated by a soft \"Ow.\"  Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of fear washing over her. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to take you.\"\n\nHer mother's voice, weak and strained, directed her hands with a trembling urgency.  In that moment, the strength she'd built in her own body, a testament to her restless spirit, became a beacon of hope.  She lifted her mother, the weight a burden and a blessing, and carried her to the car.  \n\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but her mind was a storm of concern, focused solely on her mother.  She rushed her inside, her voice a frantic plea for help.  A blur of faces, white coats, and hurried words surrounded her as they wheeled her mother away. She was left alone, the weight of her mother's fate pressing down on her, a heavy silence filling the space where her mother's laughter usually resided.\n\nThe story, when it was finally pieced together, was a simple one.  A fall from a stool, a reach for a vase, a misplaced step. But the simplicity couldn't mask the terror that had gripped her heart.",

They called it the Mediterranean, a name like a ghost, a whisper from a world that had gone. Like a dream of olive trees and sun-drenched stones, a memory of warmth. But here, the air was thin and dry. \n\nThey wanted to know if this diet, this aMed, could hold back the tide of sickness. Could it ward off the cold grip of heart disease and the sudden, brutal blow of a stroke? \n\nThey followed these women, 74,886 of them, their lives laid out like a map, their food choices recorded in meticulous detail. Questionnaires, they called them, these scraps of paper holding the weight of years. They asked about the things they ate: the fruits, the nuts, the fish, the oil that tasted of sunlight. And the things they avoided: the meat, the fat, the things that rotted the body from within. \n\nThe women's lives unfolded against the backdrop of a relentless march of time. They watched as years bled into decades, as bodies changed, as shadows grew longer. Some women fell ill, their faces etched with pain, their breaths shallow and quick. Others lived on, their lives a testament to resilience, a flicker of light in the encroaching darkness. \n\nThey measured their lives in numbers, in risks and ratios, in the bitterness of aspirin and the fleeting comfort of a multivitamin. They looked for patterns, for threads that might unravel the mysteries of life and death.\n\nAnd in the end, what did they find? A glimmer of hope. A whisper of possibility. The women who ate like the sun, they found, lived longer, healthier lives. The women who clung to the shadows, they withered away.  \n\nIt wasn't enough, of course. Not a cure, not a guarantee. Just a glimpse of a world where life might hold a little more light, a little more warmth. A world where the dust could settle, and the sun could shine again.",
            "The country broke in '07. A sickness in the bones of the world, spreading through the veins of the banks. Men in suits, eyes glazed with greed, had built towers of paper promises, stacked high and blind to the rot at their core. Houses, mortgages, futures, all traded like cattle, bought and sold with whispers and lies. \n\nThey called it a crisis, a recession, a downturn. But it was more like a death rattle, a slow strangling of the soul of the nation. The old ways – work, sweat, honest toil – forgotten, replaced by the quickening pulse of a market that devoured all in its path. Clinton, he'd loosened the reins, thinking he could ride the beast. He sought to extend his own power, but the beast had other plans. It didn't care for presidents, for policies, for promises. It devoured them all.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, their names whispered in the smoke-filled rooms where deals were struck. They were the feeders, funneling the poison into the veins of the people. Mortgages like cheap whiskey, easy to swallow, leaving a burning in the throat but a false promise of comfort.\n\nHolmes, he saw it coming. A prophet in a newspaper, his words stark against the glittering facade. He spoke of trouble, of a storm brewing, a government rescue. But the music played on, the dance continued, and the storm broke.\n\nThe houses, they ceased to be homes. They became numbers, assets, collateral. The people, their dreams stuffed into the pockets of the wealthy, left with nothing but empty rooms and hollow promises.\n\nAnd the banks? They rotted from within, their arteries clogged with the sludge of bad loans. The giants fell, one by one, their collapse echoing through the canyons of Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, names whispered in fear. They survived, transformed, their claws sunk deeper into the flesh of the nation.\n\nFannie and Freddie, they were the casualties. Their names now synonymous with failure, their bodies propped up by the very government they had served.\n\nThe air is thick with the smell of ash, the taste of dust. The ground trembles, the foundations crack. The people stand, dazed and uncertain, in the ruins of their dreams.\n\nAnd the question remains: how do we rebuild? How do we stand against the tide of greed and folly? How do we find our way back to the light?",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a perpetual haze settling over everything.  It clung to the back of his throat, a gritty reminder of the world that had been consumed.  He tightened his grip on the boy's hand, their fingers intertwined like the roots of ancient oaks clinging to a crumbling hillside.  They were moving south, fleeing the relentless chill that had seeped into the bones of the land.  Winter was coming, a predator stalking the horizon, and they had to outrun it.  \n\nThe boy, his eyes wide and reflecting the faint light of the dying sun, looked up at him, his voice a small whisper against the wind. \"Are we going to die?\"\n\nHe squeezed his hand, a silent reassurance. \"Not now,\" he rasped, his voice rough from disuse. \"Not yet.\"  \n\nThey walked in silence, the only sound the crunch of dead leaves underfoot and the boy's soft breathing.  The world stretched out before them, a desolate canvas of ash-covered fields and skeletal trees reaching towards a sky choked with smoke.  A city, once a monument to human ambition, now lay in ruins, a jagged scar on the landscape.  It was a place where ghosts walked, where memories lingered like the scent of smoke and decay.  They had seen things along the way, things that would haunt their dreams for years to come.  But they pressed on, driven by a desperate hope for a future, for warmth, for a world where the sun still shone and the air was not thick with the taste of ash.",
            "The screen flickered, a pale ghost of light in the dusk. Two voices, distant and hollow, droned out stories from a city named Columbus, Ohio. The first, an NBC dispatch, a man, a name – Shad Hostettler – a face, a cold stare, a mugshot in the flickering gloom. Ashley. Ohio. Stabbing.  The wife nameless, a shadow in the brief account. Evil, the word hung in the air, a thin, acrid taste. Two minutes, they gave it, a passing glance.\n\nThe next story, Travis Buyers, eighteen. A young whisper, cut short in the Sharon Woods. Shooting, critical, no names, no faces. A shadowy figure, a black hole where a life should have been. The SWAT team moved in, silent, efficient, but the story itself, brief, hurried,  like a bird fleeing a sudden storm.  A stain on the edges of the screen, barely there. \n\nA .22.  A helicopter, a wound in its side, a story of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward, a whispered plea for justice. The city held its breath.\n\nRain. Thunder. A weekend forecast, a promise of a storm. A fleeting glance, a nudge to keep watching.\n\nThen,  a robbery. A Clime Road UDF.  A dark figure, a hoodie, \na weight of words, an insistence on color. Six-foot tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. Black.  \n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a name from Texas, a legacy of marijuana, 300 months.  A Hispanic man. A statistic, a label, a cold whisper in the night.\n\nThe screen flickered again, the voices faded, and the darkness returned.",
            "The blood ties bind, they do. A brother to a brother. A knot that can't be untied, no matter the tangle. It's a thing of darkness and light, woven with love and hate, pride and scorn. A brother sees his own reflection in the eyes of another, clearer than any mirror. He sees the good and the bad, the truth that hides from the world. And when the world turns dark, that bond tightens, reveals its true heart. \n\nIt's a costly thing, this understanding. The weight of it crushes you down, leaves scars you can't hide. But in the shadow of that knowledge, you learn what it means to be a man. You learn what it means to be bound.\n\nThey walked through a world painted in the colors of decay, two brothers against the dying light. A journey, futile and desperate, etched across the landscape like a scar. Pride, sharp and bitter, clashed against the desperation of hope. Blood spilled in the fading light, and only one man walked away.  \n\nThe older brother, he saw himself in the younger, a reflection warped by time and circumstance. His own failings, his own hunger for a world that wasn't there, they stared back at him.  He saw the boy, Doodle, as a burden, a shadow clinging to his heels. But in the depths of that shadow, he saw a spark. A flicker of life that mirrored his own.\n\nHe tried to teach him, to break him free of that fragile shell. To mold him into the warrior he wished he could be. But the boy, he was born broken. A fragile bird with clipped wings.  And the older brother, he was the one who clipped them. \n\nThe world around them, it was a canvas painted in shades of gray. The air hung heavy with the scent of decay. It was a world that mirrored the darkness in their hearts.",
            "The mind. A tangled thicket. A whispering canyon. They called it a machine once. A clockwork thing. Then a loom, weaving patterns from the threads of sense. Now they speak of circuits and algorithms, but the truth is darker. The brain is a cave, a labyrinth of shadow and bone, where the echoes of experience cling to the damp walls.\n\nIt takes in the world through senses, raw sensations like water seeping through a sieve. Touch, taste, sound, sight – these are the building blocks, the primal stones. But the mind, it shapes them. It twists, it turns, it carves meaning from the chaos.\n\nImagine a box, a black void on a white expanse. The eye sees it, the brain interprets.  But what is a box? A shape, a container, a memory of a past confinement.  The mind doesn't just see, it remembers, it anticipates, it builds stories from the fragments.  It judges, it sifts, it chooses what to hold onto, what to cast aside.\n\nAttention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it burns bright on a single point, then fades, leaving everything else to drift.  A name spoken in a crowd, a single blade of grass against the dust.  The mind filters, it protects, it prioritizes.\n\nAnd memory. A phantom limb, a ghost in the machine.  The past lingers, a faint scent, a half-remembered dream.  Sensory, working, long-term – these are just labels, attempts to categorize the untamable.  Memories cling to the brain like barnacles to a hull, some smooth and polished, others rough and jagged.\n\nHow is knowledge stored?  A network?  A map?  A tapestry woven from threads of experience?  Perhaps it's something else entirely, a language spoken only by neurons, a symphony of chemical signals.\n\nThe truth, like the brain itself, remains elusive.  A mystery hidden in plain sight, a labyrinth waiting to be explored.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of some long-gone world. Huxley, he saw it coming, this brave new dawn. A sun bleached and sterile, a sky choked with the smoke of progress.  He built this world, this *Brave New World*, to show us the price of comfort, the cost of forgetting. They chased happiness like a phantom, these people, conditioned from birth to believe in the illusion. They were cogs in a machine, oiled by pleasure and ignorance.\n\nHe saw through it, Huxley did. Through the World Controller's blinding light, through the manufactured contentment. He smelled the rot beneath the surface, the stench of homogeny and reification. These were not men and women, but products, their souls ground down and molded into conformity. They  were slaves to the system, their minds dulled by the constant hum of false consciousness.\n\nHe spoke their language, Huxley did. He used their words, their terms - *capitalism*, *proletariat*, *hegemony*. He laid bare the truth, the gnawing emptiness at the heart of their 'perfect' world. They thought they were free, these people, but they were bound by invisible chains, forged in the fires of consumerism.  \n\nAnd love? Love was a forgotten relic, a whisper in the wind.  The touch of another human being was reduced to a transaction, a fleeting moment of manufactured intimacy.  They were shadows, these people, their individuality extinguished by the relentless glare of their own desires. \n\nHuxley saw it all, the darkness lurking behind the facade. He knew that true freedom was not found in the pursuit of pleasure, but in the acceptance of pain, in the embrace of the human condition. He left us with a warning, a stark reminder that the pursuit of happiness can lead to the greatest of tragedies.",
            "The limestone dust lay thick on the campus. Four and a half semesters. That's how long I'd been here, a boy adrift in this sea of brick and mortar. East Halls they called it, the place they shoved you when you first came in, like a stray dog in a holding pen. The damned place was a world away from Willard, a godforsaken trek across barren fields and asphalt plains. Twenty-five minutes on foot, they said. More like an hour when the wind sliced through you like a butcher's blade. The old timers, they talked of it as a different time, these halls swallowed by fields, a forgotten wilderness. Now it was choked with new buildings, a monument to their hunger for growth. The Creamery, the health center, all rising like tombstones in the dust. But the ground beneath still remembers. It remembers the emptiness, the silence. \n\nA friend, a brother in this struggle, he'd come back to the bike. Years he'd been away, but the truth of it never fades: \"Bikes,\" he said, his voice rough like gravel, \"The only way to move.\" A bowl of gruel and a man's will, that's all it takes. Thirty miles, maybe more. I saw it this year, the truth of it. Off-campus now, just like those dorms, a world away from the heart of things. But I bought a bike. A salvation. Twenty-five minutes, maybe an hour, cut to five if the wind's at your back. Pollock Road, that black scar cutting through the campus, it's not a kind road. But it's the shortest path.  Time is a thief, they say. And it's stealing mine.  Walking, they say, good for the soul. But the soul has no time for sentiment. A bike, it's freedom. It's the only way to outrun the dust."
