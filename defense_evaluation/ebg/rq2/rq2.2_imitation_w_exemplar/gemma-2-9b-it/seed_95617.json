            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

The city, a burnt husk, was a phantom memory, a ghost town in the wasteland. I had seen too much of that kind of emptiness, too much of the hollow stares of the abandoned.  \n\nThis road, it led to a different kind of emptiness, the kind that settled deep in your bones, the kind that gnawed at the heart. The kind that only a child's eyes could pierce. Those eyes, wide and innocent, looking for a flicker of hope, a spark of light in the growing darkness.\n\nThey say there’s a fire in every heart. But mine, it felt like a dying ember, threatened by the ever-present chill. I could still remember the heat of another fire, though, a fire of rage that burned in my gut that day I stood on the porch, watching the boy sit on the edge of the couch, his face pale and drawn. His words, whispered through choked sobs, echoed in my ears: \"They're hurting me.\" \n\nThat's when I decided to fight. Not with fists or guns, but with the only weapon I had left: my will. I would be his shield, his protector. I would be the voice for those who had no voice.\n\nThe road stretched on, and the wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. But somewhere, deep inside, the ember flickered. It was a small flame, but it was enough. Enough to keep me going, enough to keep me fighting for the boy, for the hope that maybe, just maybe, we could find a place where the sun still shone.",
            "The dust of affliction. That's what insomnia is, a slow, creeping dust that settles in the bones, the mind, the very marrow of a man. Some say it's in the blood, a curse woven into the fibers of your being. A legacy inherited from some long-dead ancestor who knew the cold grip of sleepless nights. Others say it's the world that's to blame, the weight of it pressing down, a shroud of worry and hardship woven from the fabric of society itself.\n\nThey call these the biological and sociocultural models, each trying to lay claim to the darkness that steals sleep. The biological folks, they talk of genes, of wiring in the brain gone awry. They point to the hypothalamus, a tiny part of the brain that acts like a switchboard for sleep and wakefulness, and they tell stories of neurons firing out of sync, of orexin, a chemical messenger, failing to do its job. They speak of mice, of experiments, of receptors and agonists, words that sound like whispers from the dark. They say a man's fate is written in his genes, that sleeplessness is a burden passed down through generations, a darkness inherited.\n\nThe others, the sociocultural folks, they look at the world outside the skull. They see the burdens of race and class, the weight of poverty and oppression, the gnawing anxieties of a world gone mad. They say that insomnia is not just a disease of the body, but a disease of the soul, a symptom of a society that forgets the simple human need for rest. They see the city lights, the endless hum of technology, the relentless pressure to perform, and they say, This is the world that steals sleep.\n\nBoth sides offer their explanations, their pieces of the puzzle. But the truth, it's probably somewhere in the shadows, a tangled knot of biology and circumstance, of genes and environment, of the whispers in the blood and the weight of the world.  And maybe, just maybe, the answer lies not in finding a cure, but in learning to live with the darkness, to find peace in the sleepless night.",

A wasteland, silent save for the whisper of the wind and the distant, mournful cry of a crow.  This was the country of sounds uncaught, of words lost in the echoing emptiness. Here, in this desolate place, lived a boy and a man, bound together by a whispered word, a shared burden. The boy, with eyes wide and watchful, strained to hear the world around him, but the sounds were fragmented, incomplete.  His world was a tapestry woven with gaps, threads of sound tangled and broken.  This was the mark of the Silent World, a place where the ear heard but the mind could not grasp. \n\nThe man, his face etched with the weariness of a long road traveled, knew the boy's struggle.

This was the burden he carried, the burden of the Silent World.\n\nThey journeyed together, father and son, across this desolate landscape, their steps echoing on the cracked earth. The man, a silent guardian, watched over the boy, shielding him from the harshness of their reality. He knew the world could be a cruel place for those who could not hear it fully.\n\nThe man had learned to read the boy's world, to understand the subtle cues, the unspoken language of gestures and facial expressions. He spoke slowly, carefully, ensuring each word reached the boy's ears, each syllable a precious offering in a world where words could vanish like smoke on the wind.\n\nThey moved from place to place, seeking refuge in the remnants of a shattered world.

She is cut off from the solace of her own kind, her feminine strength rendered invisible.  And in the mist of this masquerade, Olivia, entangled in a web of her own, mistakes Viola for a man, mistaking the reflection for the source.  “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). \n\nOrsino, too, is drawn into the dance, confessing to Viola/Cesario, “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).  Is this a progressive yearning for a love beyond convention? Or is it a reflection of the human heart, forever searching, forever seeking what it cannot name?\n\nOlivia’s swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, her acceptance of Viola as sister rather than lover, speaks of a society where appearances hold sway. Is she truly prejudiced against women? Or is she merely a product of her time, blind to the truth that lies beneath the surface?\n\nTwelfth Night, a play of shadows and light, exposes the human heart's capacity for both deceit and yearning. It reminds us that truth, like a fragile butterfly, must be handled with care, for its wings are easily broken.",
            "The land was marked by the ghosts of its own making. The skeletal bones of trees, bleached white against the dust-choked sky, spoke of a violence done, of a fire that had raged and consumed. This was German South West Africa, a place where the whispers of genocide still clung to the air, a stench of ash and sorrow clinging to the wind.  The Ovaherero and Nama, their names like broken promises, were swallowed by the earth, their spirits scattered on the plains.\n\nBut empires, even those stained with blood, weren't uniform.  Their shadows stretched long and twisted, casting different hues across their domains.  In Tanganyika, where the British later took root, they found a people who had tasted the bitter fruit of knowledge.  Schools, built by the Germans, stood as monuments to a different, perhaps more humane, vision.  In Kamerun and other corners, the whispers spoke of education, of progress, a faint echo of a forgotten dream.\n\nBut here, in this desolate kingdom, a different story unfolded.  The Germans, they came with promises of civilization, of progress, but their gaze fell upon the native souls with a cold indifference.  Education, for them, was a luxury reserved for the conquerors, not the conquered. The task of shaping minds was left to the missionaries, their words a flickering candle in the vast darkness.\n\nThe iron fist of the state, so strong in other colonies, was loose here.  The government, content to hoard its resources, turned a blind eye to the plight of the natives, their fate a matter of indifference.  Schools for the white settlers, those who claimed ownership of this barren land, were meticulously crafted, their halls echoing with the pronouncements of a superior race.  But the native children, their eyes filled with the despair of a forgotten world, were left to tread the dusty paths of ignorance.\n\nThis, then, was the legacy of German rule in South West Africa: a chasm of inequality, a scar etched deep into the soul of the land.  The echoes of their cruelty still reverberated through the ages, a testament to the enduring damage inflicted by the hunger for power and dominion.",
            "The air hangs thick with the sound of a hundred names, a hundred faces, a hundred stories crowding in on themselves. Popular music. A sprawling landscape, a graveyard of ghosts, all clamoring for a place in the sun. Rock, blues, country, folk, each a tattered banner waving in the wind, each a wound bleeding out its own unique song. And somewhere in that chaos, a knot of darkness tightened, a fist clenched around a microphone, a scream echoing through the canyons of sound. That was metal.\n\nForty years gone, and it's grown like a tumor, a cancer of the soul, branching and burrowing, feeding on the raw nerves of the world.  Subgenres bloom like mushrooms in the dark, each one a reflection of some inner hunger, some private hell.  Heavy metal, they called it, a name that whispered of doom and defiance.\n\nIt's a music born of shadows, a symphony of dissonance. More bass, more volume, more fury. A shriek of guitars, drums like thunderclaps, a voice that rips through the silence like a banshee.  A hunger for something primal, something real, something that could shake the very foundations of the world.\n\nIt's a music of excess, a testament to the limits of human endurance.  Drugs a fuel, a catalyst, a mask for the demons that danced in the shadows.  A generation fueled by the fires of rebellion, searching for meaning in a world that had turned its back on them. \n\nThey took the darkness, the rage, the despair, and they poured it into the music.  They borrowed from the past, from the Romantics who wept for the beauty of decay, from the bluesmen who sang of heartbreak and loss, from the ancient myths that whispered of gods and monsters.  They wove it all together into a tapestry of sound, a dark and glorious tapestry that reflected the broken world around them.\n\nThere's a line in a song, a line that captures the essence of it all: \"Helter Skelter.\" The Beatles, they called it. A glimpse into a world teetering on the edge, a world drowning in its own madness. It wasn't just the music, it was the message.  A scream into the void, a plea for something more.\n\nAnd it found its echo in the hearts of those who felt lost, those who craved something more than the mundane, something that could make them feel alive.",
            "The year was 1910. Henri Rousseau, a man haunted by dreams both literal and figurative, set his brush to canvas. The Dream, the painting he birthed, wasn't just a woman lost in a fantastical landscape. It was Rousseau’s soul laid bare, a testament to the internal struggle that gnawed at him. For years, he'd dreamt of the art world’s embrace, of the whispers of praise, the murmur of recognition. But the path to such acclaim seemed blocked, a thorny thicket of convention and expectation.  He yearned to be seen, but could he be seen for who he truly was, or would he be forced to bend his vision to the will of the critics he so desperately sought to please?\n\nBefore you can truly understand The Dream, you need to know the man behind the brush. Henri Rousseau, born in the year 1844, was a man of humble beginnings. His father, a tinsmith, toiled for a living, and young Henri was raised in the shadow of his father's modest prosperity.  He never received formal training in art, instead finding himself bound to a life of public service, a gabelou, a toll collector for the French government. His early years were marked by tragedy, the loss of a wife and eight children leaving him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his solace, a window into a world where his dreams could take flight.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance wasn't born from vanity. He wasn't trying to be the darling of the art world; he simply wanted to be seen, to have his work understood. He was a man of the people, a folk artist who captured their hopes and dreams in his paintings. However, the art world he entered was dominated by artists with pedigrees and connections, artists like Matisse, whose talent was undeniable, whose path to fame seemed easy. Rousseau, a self-taught outsider, felt the weight of their success, the pressure to conform, to mimic their style, to earn a place at their table. The question that haunted him was this: could he find his own voice, his own truth, without losing the very thing he longed for - recognition? \n\nAnd so, within The Dream, we see the reflection of this struggle. It's a painting that speaks not only of a woman lost in a fantastical world, but also of a man lost in the labyrinth of his own desires. A man searching for a place where his dreams could finally take root, where he could finally be seen for the artist he truly was.",
            "The line between what's right and what's fair, they say, it runs thin as a razor. And that notion, it echoes in the silence of a dusty room, in the brushstrokes of a faded canvas. There's a truth to it, a kind of knowing, that hums beneath the surface. Like the sun on a cracked windowpane, it casts a pale light on things we can't quite grasp. \n\nMen have tried to pin it down, this truth, this beauty. Keats, he saw it in a silent urn, a frozen moment of grace. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he wrote. But even in his words, it feels like a whisper on the wind, something glimpsed at the edge of vision. We learn things, sure. We read books, we swallow lessons whole. But this... this is different. \n\nIt's in the way a rain-soaked canvas holds the memory of a storm, in the ache of a melody that speaks to a forgotten longing. It's in the silences between the words, in the spaces where the soul slips through.\n\nWe dissect art, we analyze morals, but the heart of it, the soul of it, that remains elusive. We talk about brushstrokes and composition, about right and wrong, but the essence, the spark, it's always just beyond our reach. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And it's true. Words can stumble, they can fall short. But stories, they hold the weight of unspoken truths, the echoes of a deeper knowing.\n\nAnd ethics? It's the same. We build codes, we argue points, but the true heart of it, that resides in the realm of the unspoken, the ineffable. It's a feeling, a gut-knowing, that transcends the reach of language.\n\nKeats, O'Connor, Wittgenstein, they all sensed it. That something more, that thing that whispers in the darkness, that makes us shiver and sigh and reach for understanding. It's the thread that runs through art and ethics, a connection woven in the fabric of our being. It's the language of the soul.",
            "The ghost of a country, Germany, lingers still. A specter of power, stitched together from the shadows of the Alps where München sleeps, to the salt-laced breath of Kiel on the Baltic. A single soul, beating beneath the weight of its history, felt from the cobbled streets of Köln, down the Rhine to the Saxon city of Dresden, clinging to the Elbe. This Germany, forged in blood and ash, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, whispers its past in every windswept stone.\n\nGermania, the ancestral cradle. The name itself a wound, its origins a maze of contested theories. Tacitus, in his ancient chronicle, claimed it stemmed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed the Rhine before clashing with the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his own testament to conquest, a term to mark the difference between the vanquished Gauls and those who remained free, those who fought under the furs and iron of the north. Some say it came from the Gauls themselves, a word for those who lived beyond the known world. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of this land, of the \"Germans who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" But others whisper of a different origin, a weapon forged in the heart of Germania, the spear known as the \"ger,\" or perhaps a word from the ancient tongue of the Irish, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the thunderous voices of a people who knew only war and freedom.\n\nTacitus, in his own grim testament to the German spirit, wrote of a people untouched by the tide of history, a people who had never left their ancestral lands: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He paints a picture of a land untouched by Rome, a land of wild beauty and harshness, a land where the air itself tasted of iron and frost.  \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive,\" he writes, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"  \n\nAnd indeed, the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, bartered for its riches, and took what they could, but the heart of Germany, its unyielding spirit, remained untamed. The Germanic tribes, ever vigilant, traded their wares and fought in the legions of Rome, forever a thorn in the side of the empire.",
            "The brown water churned, a thick slurry of some nameless thing.  His hand hovered, a pale ghost over the porcelain rim. He didn't look down. Didn't need to. The shape of it was etched already on the back of his eyelids. A stain in the white emptiness. The slick sheen of it, the pale brown fringe. He thought of the artist's book, the one he'd bought on a whim.  \"See the world as a simple shape,\" it said.  A bowl of fruit, a face, a goddamn turd in a bowl. But the world always held more than shapes, didn't it? \n\nHe remembered the quiet days spent poring over those pages, a desperate hunger for understanding gnawing at him.  Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Renaissance riot of color. He'd wanted to find his own palette, his own story.  Maybe it had begun here, in this dim-lit bathroom, with the stench of bleach and despair clinging to the air. \n\nHis hand moved, a twitch of muscle, a spasm of will.  He gripped the handle, a cold metal in his sweaty palm.  He wouldn't flinch.  He wouldn't think. Just move.  A single flush, a gurgle, a sigh of relief.  The shape remained, stubborn and defiant.  He squeezed his eyes shut, willing it away.\n\nHe reached for the mop, the handle slick and damp.  Green tie choking him, he stared at the brown stain.  A single thought, clear and sharp, pierced the fog: This was his canvas, this was his brush, and this goddamn turd was his muse.",
            "The road runs black and slick with the rain. They say the young ones are dying on it, these boys behind the wheel, their blood blooming on asphalt.  A kind of sickness in the blood, that's what it is. The brain, they say, it ain't finished yet. Not ready for the weight of it all.  A machine meant for humming along, carrying dreams and  dead ends, becomes a tomb.\n\n*They* say the numbers tell the story. More accidents, more rollovers, more of them going off the road, lost and foolish.  And they're not alone. The friends, the kin, the damned echoes of youth piling in, turning the car into a cage.\n\nCalifornia, they tried to fix it.  Licenses for the young, a kind of probation,  hours set, passengers banned. A band-aid on a festering wound.\n\nThe truth is, the young ones are wired different. A fire in their bellies, a need to taste the danger. The old man Zuckerman, he says it himself – eighteen's not enough. They crave the rush, the taste of the brink.\n\nAnd what comes next?\n\nMillions more, the boomers' children, all itching to get behind the wheel.  A blood harvest waiting to happen.\n\nThey talk about solutions. Schools, driver's ed, hours of practice. But the real answer, it's a line in the sand.  A line drawn before the fire catches hold.  Not eighteen, not yet.  Wait, let the fire die down.\n\nLet the years pass.  \n\nLet them learn to walk before they run.\n\nLet them learn to live before they die.",
            "The Library of Congress, a vast repository of forgotten things, held a trove of Edison's early films. Among them, fifteen trick films, flickering shadows from the years 1895 to 1901. Illusions woven from the nascent art of editing, they whispered of a time before the moving picture had found its voice. My study of these films sought to unravel the poetics, the common thread that bound them, while also peering into the nascent wrinkles of evolution that creased a few of the later works.\n\nThe trick films of the turn of the century, for the most part, were creatures of constraint. They lived within the confines of a stage, a proscenium frame that held them captive. The camera, a silent observer, never strayed from its fixed position. It was a world of frozen moments, of figures confined to a single plane, moving side to side like ghosts in a box.\n\nThe influence of the stage, of vaudeville and magic, lingered heavy in these films. Actors, bound by the stage's limitations, never ventured towards or away from the camera. Think of \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where the actors, like marionettes, danced along a horizontal axis, never breaking the confines of the frame. \n\nThe world of these trick films was a stage, the camera a distant eye fixed upon it. Long shots, and occasionally medium shots, were all that filled the frame. Close-ups, a language yet to be discovered, were absent. The audience, like those in the old theaters, saw the whole performance laid bare, confined by the proscenium's rigid embrace.\n\nThe films themselves were structured like a single, unbroken breath. Each concept, each trick, was captured in a single shot, a film. This limited their length, their narratives, to the brevity of a fleeting moment.  They were vaudeville sketches, glimpses of magic, disappearing acts, woven together with tricks that defied the eye. But even within this constraint, there were whispers of change. \n\nExamine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, where a single shot is stitched together to create the illusion of a severed head.  A hint, a promise, of a more complex language to come.",
            "John Taylor, a man of Caroline, spoke with the fire of a young Republic in his belly. His life was bound to the soil, a farmer through and through, but the land had forged in him a spirit that echoed in the halls of Congress. He was known for his words, for the way he stood against the tide, a bulwark against what he saw as the encroaching hand of the state.  His faith in the life of the soil, in the sweat of the brow, colored every argument, every conviction. It was this devotion to the farmer, this belief that agriculture was the true backbone of a nation, that fueled his fire on matters of sovereignty, of the very meaning of the Constitution, even the way justice was dispensed.\n\n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to build something different, something better. A clean slate, unburdened by the dead weight of tradition. He believed in the innate rights of man, rights woven into the fabric of existence, rights that were all interconnected, each dependent on the other. If one was trampled, they all withered. These rights, he claimed, were sacred, beyond the reach of any government, any man. He spoke of a \"state of nature,\" a world where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning ruled over virtue. But in a civilized society, he argued, this had to change.\n\nThis ideal society, this haven of liberty, could only be built on a government that understood the duality of man, the inherent good and the ever-present evil. He was a man of stark contrasts, a believer in black and white, in the fundamental nature of good and evil. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.” He defined good principles as those that protected private property, those that nurtured the land, and those that kept the wolf of unchecked capitalism at bay. He believed that a government built on these principles, even if administered by men driven by avarice and self-interest, would somehow find a balance, a way to function fairly. He saw self-interest as the engine of man, a force that could be harnessed for the common good, but that could also lead to chaos if left unchecked.\n\nTaylor was a strict constructionist, a man who believed in the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. He craved a limited federal government, one that held no more power than that explicitly granted to it. He saw a large, expansive government as a threat, a breeding ground for tyranny. But he also feared a blind, literal interpretation of the law, a rigid adherence to words that could twist and turn into something monstrous. He found solace in the Declaration of Independence, a document that, he believed, more clearly articulated the nature of the United States as a union of sovereign states, rather than a single, indivisible nation.",
            "The numbers in Figure 17, they fell off a precipice come the third month. A hard thing to swallow, that. The why of it, though, it's a riddle wrapped in a shroud. Winter's grip on this New England campus, you see, it chills the bones, and folks tend to stay inside. Bikes and footpaths, they fall silent then. And December, that's a month of deadlines and grades, of frantic packing and a desperate clinging to the last embers of freedom before the long holiday break. A commuter log, it's a small thing, easy to forget in the rush. Then the break itself, a month of silence and absence. Not even the ghosts of commuters linger on the paths. January, its return a slow, hesitant bloom, a trickle of life returning to the frozen ground. But February, that was a deeper chill. A hollow space where the numbers should have been.\n\nThere's a weariness to these things, a natural ebb and flow. Like the tide, the initial surge of enthusiasm recedes, leaving behind a quiet stillness. We tried to fight it, to shore up the banks with the Carpool Challenge Week. A blitz, a burst of energy in March, and the numbers rose again, but the underlying current, it remained.\n\nThe truth is, the car, it's a siren song, a deep-rooted yearning for freedom on the open road. It's woven into the very fabric of this society. So, we offered enticements. Gift certificates, a taste of sweetness to draw them in. Restaurants, coffee shops, massages, even books and trinkets. It was a good start, but I wonder, would a bolder gesture have swayed them? A bicycle, a hybrid, a whisper of electric promise. Perhaps a bigger prize, a beacon in the darkness, might have kept the flame alive.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same, a constant hum of reward. But what if they had grown, evolved with the project? A promise of a bicycle in December, a hybrid in January, a whisper of electric freedom in February. Would it have been enough to keep the numbers climbing, to break through the winter's chill?",
            "The road stretched black and empty, a ribbon of ash against the dying light.  An ETF, they called it. A basket of stocks, a gamble cast on the board of the market.  Like a preacher's promise, it whispered of diversification, of low fees, of easy wealth.  But the devil, they said, is in the details.\n\nThis ETF, IHF, they called it.  A cage full of caged birds, each a company, a name on a ticker tape, a sliver of ownership in the vast machine.  The brochure spoke of its holdings, ten companies locked inside, their percentage of the whole laid out like sins laid bare. Sixty-three percent, it claimed, of the ETF's heart beat within those ten.\n\nBut was it a heart at all?  A beating flesh and blood thing? Or a hollow shell, a brittle cage rattling in the wind?  To find out, you had to look closer, to see beyond the glossy promise.\n\nSo I took those ten companies, those caged birds, and I set them free.  I measured their wings, their flight, their hunger.  I saw their shadows stretching long and lean against the horizon of the market.  Their returns, their risks, their stories whispered in the language of numbers.\n\nThe ETF, it promised a steady flight, a measured climb.  But the ten, they danced to a different tune.  Some soared high, some dipped low, some crashed and burned.  In their chaos, a truth began to emerge.\n\nThe ETF, it was a lie, a smoothed-over surface, a painted smile upon a cracked face.  The ten, they were the real thing, raw and wild, a reflection of the market's own untamed heart.  You could watch them, study them, understand them better than you ever could the gilded cage that claimed to contain them.\n\nThe question then was not whether the ETF was better, but whether it was necessary.  Was the cage, with its assurances and its limitations, worth the price of its confinement?  Or was freedom, even in its chaos, a better gamble?",
            "The dark land of dream, that’s what they called it. Poe dreamt it up, called it Thulé, a word that echoed back from some old man’s book, Virgil’s maybe. A place north of Britain, the edge of the world, where the Greeks kept their shadows. Poe knew these things, these forgotten words. He’d swallowed them whole, like the German poets he admired, swallowed Goethe too, whole and undigested. \n\nSome say Poe was just copying, mimicking the shadows of a greater man. This Arndt fella, he saw it, said Poe was just a pale reflection of Goethe’s King of Thulé. A king drowning in grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, a memory of his dead queen tasting bitter on his tongue. A king who walked to the edge of the world, tossed the goblet into the black water and let go.\n\nGoethe’s Faust, they said, that was the real thing. A play in two parts, the first born in 1808, the second when the old man himself breathed his last.  A king, a goblet, a death. Poe, they say, he knew the story. Heard it whispered in the wind, saw it in his own dreams. He’d even read it in that play, Faust, a few years before he wrote his own dark poem, The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nThulé, the name echoed, twice in Poe’s own work. First in The Pit, then again in Dream-Land, like a bookend to the darkness. The king in Dream-Land, he’s a ghost of the king in Thulé.  Alone, haunted by his memories, seeing the world in shades of gray. Another king, lost in his own grief. \n\nPoe, he knew Goethe. Maybe not in person, but he knew him through the words, through the echoes that resonated in his own soul.  He knew him because he knew Tennyson, who knew him too. And Poe, he knew the power of words, the way they could shape and mold a man’s soul.",
            "The applesauce lay slick on the linoleum, a slick smear of crimson against the dull tile. A stain, a testament. She came in like a whisper, a shift of shadows in the aisles, and the floor betrayed her.  He, the manager, had known. Twice he’d been told. Twice the warning had crawled into his ears, a whine barely audible over the hum of fluorescent lights and the clatter of carts. Twice he’d brushed it aside. Dinner, he’d mumbled. No time for complaints. But the smell of applesauce, cloying and sweet, had lingered, a phantom promise of trouble. Now, the silence held a different kind of weight, a heavy sigh of consequence. \n\nThe law, it whispers, speaks of malice, of a disregard for the possible harm.  Willfulness. A conscious choice to ignore the danger, like a man who dances with a loaded gun.  Six times before, they’d tripped, stumbled, fallen.  Six times the warning had been sounded. And six times, the music played on.\n\nShe, the injured one, will say he knew. He knew the floor was a trap, a waiting snare.  He knew the applesauce would become a slick, crimson ribbon, a path to pain. And he chose to look away.\n\nThey’ll talk of “despicable,” a word that hangs in the air, heavy with judgment.  They’ll dissect his actions, weigh them against the scales of justice. And he, the man who shut his eyes to the danger, will stand accused.  \n\nThe law, it is a cold, sharp blade. It cuts through the pretense, the justifications, and lays bare the truth.  And in the cold light of that truth,  he will have to answer.",
            "The dust had settled four years gone, back when the air still hummed with the echo of that first class on Islam at CBC. They argued then about the nature of the faith, whether it was a wolf in sheep's clothing or some lamb of God.  But the world's turned, spun itself on its axis since then, and the question seems sharper now, more urgent. The newsmen, they shifted their stance, once painting Islam with the same brush as those desert devils, now fawning over it, a reverence bordering on the absurd.  You wouldn't have caught a candidate with a name like Borac Obama back then, a name that whispers of a faith that was once vilified, a faith that now seems to walk hand-in-hand with the President himself.\n\nThey say the Prophet's story is one of humility, a man misunderstood, a gentle soul who drew others in with his words.  But the stories I knew, the ones etched in my memory, spoke of conquest, of swords and fire, of tribes forced to bend the knee.  They painted him a warrior, not a shepherd.  This new portrait, this biography, whispers of a different man, a man who needed no force, only truth, a man who drew men to him like moths to a flame.  \n\nAnd yet, there's a shadow of familiarity in the tales, echoes that resonate with the whispers of another story, another prophet, another miracle.  The multiplying mutton, the shared milk, a story that speaks of a power beyond man, a power that echoes across time and faith.  But it's a shadow, a pale imitation, a false dawn.  It diminishes the wonder of the true miracle, the life and death of Christ, a light that shines brighter than any borrowed flame.\n\nThese stories, these “proofs,” they twist and turn, relying on a chain of whispers, a game of telephone passed down through generations.  They lack the weight of firsthand experience, the tangibility of truth.  Instead, they offer a flimsy tapestry woven with doubt, a fragile construct that crumbles under scrutiny.\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that chills me to the bone, is the attempt to paint Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of light, a gentle soul.  But history whispers a different tale, a tale of ambition, of conquest, a tale that clashes with this romanticized vision.  And I wonder, I truly wonder, if the faithful know the true story, the story hidden beneath the layers of myth and legend, the story of the man behind the mask.",
            "The words of the man from Nazareth, they faded fast. Like dust on the wind. The faith that bloomed in his wake, it twisted.  Bent and warped by the hands of men, reaching for power, for comfort, for a God shaped in their own image. \n\nThe world spins on, restless and hungry. A thirst for change, for something new, it burns in the hearts of men. Old ways crumble, cast aside like worn-out clothes. But those who cling to the shadows, they fear the light. They clutch their scriptures tight, afraid to see what lies beyond.\n\nYet a whisper stirs. A yearning for truth. A hunger for the primal word, untainted by the accretions of time. It will grow, this yearning, a tide rising against the shore.  Decades will pass, centuries may fall, but the tide will rise.  The clock will turn back, its hands unwinding the knots of dogma, unraveling the layers of man-made belief.  What remains will be the bare bones of the man from Nazareth's message, stripped and stark.\n\nAnd when this tide reaches the shores of the known world, a new dawn will break. Churches, those monuments to man's striving, will stand tall, but within their walls, the echoes will change. The multitude will gather, not to hear the pronouncements of men, but to listen to the whispers of the heart.  \n\nDiversity will give way to unity, not of doctrine, but of spirit.  The divisions that scar the landscape of faith will fade, leaving a canvas washed clean.  History itself will bend, its arc tracing a path back to the source. A reversion, yes, but not a simple turning back. It will be a rebirth, a return to the wellspring, a rediscovering of the man and his message, stripped bare, raw and true.\n\nLook to the past, for in its shadows, the future hides.  Remember the rise of the eagle, the fall of empires, the slow crawl of progress.  History is a river, ever flowing, ever changing.  And in its depths, the seeds of the future lie waiting. \n\nJudaism, the cradle of faith, stands silent witness. Monotheism, the yearning for a single truth, echoes in the wind. The Hebrew scriptures, a beacon in the darkness, guide the way. There, in the heart of those ancient words, the seed of the man from Nazareth took root.",
            "The smoke rose from the factories, a black river against the sky. The buildings, stark and unforgiving, pressed in on the huddled workers,  their lives as expendable as the meat that passed through their hands. Greed, it seemed, was the only law in this place. The owners, fat and bloated on the spoils of their industry, cared nothing for the men and women who fueled their fortunes. They saw them as cogs in a machine, their labor a necessary evil, their suffering an acceptable cost. \n\nSinclair’s words, sharp as a butcher’s blade, cut through the veil of complacency: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This was no mere industry; it was a den of vipers, a place where humanity was devoured by the insatiable maw of profit.\n\nThe air itself was thick with rot, the stench of blood and decay mingling with the acrid tang of coal smoke. A man's life was measured in hours, in the relentless march of the clock, his body broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of endless labor.  \n\n\"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  These were not men; they were ghosts, their faces hollowed by hunger and fatigue, their eyes dulled by the endless grind. The owners, cloaked in their wealth, saw them as nothing more than meat, expendable and replaceable.\n\nThe Jungle was a labyrinth of despair, its walls closing in on its inhabitants, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. There were whispers of unions, flickering flames of hope struggling against the wind, but they were often corrupted, their promises as hollow as the factories themselves.  The workers, their backs bent under the yoke of oppression, had become slaves to a system that offered no escape, no redemption.\n\nSinclair's words echoed the horror, the overwhelming sense of helplessness: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The way a man shapes a story, the feeling he wants it to hold, that’s a thing of power. Some ways are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In his *Gatsby*, he paints with words, not just with brushstrokes, but with the colors themselves. Gold, green, white, red, each one a whisper, a secret understood only by the heart. He builds meaning, layer upon layer, till the colors sing.\n\nHe uses white and gray like a shroud, a blanket of uniformity. White, the clean, the bright, the promise of something better. Gray, the faded, the worn, the forgotten.  He drapes this white and gray over Daisy and Jordan, always in white, a ghostly procession. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, even Catherine powdered milky white.  It's as if the world itself is trying to smother itself in this sterile light.  And then there are the names, lost in the gray, souls swallowed by the city.\n\nHe paints the streets in shades of white and gray:  the \"white chasms\" of the city, the \"gray cars,\" the \"gray land.\"  And the people, they are shades too.  Jordan and Daisy, their girlhood a \"white\" thing. The Italian child, gray. The dog seller, a \"gray old man.\"\n\nThen, Fitzgerald takes this weight of white and gray and lays it upon Daisy. He wraps her in it, until she becomes a symbol, a desire, a phantom.  The \"white roadster,\" the \"white girlhood,\" a \"gray haze\" of fur.  She's not a woman, not anymore. She's an idea, an echo of something lost.",
            "The dust hung low over the valley, a shroud of bone-white in the dying light.  San Diego County, they called it. Once a land of plenty, choked now with the bones of what had been. Tomatoes, citrus, greens - ghosts of bounty, whispers in the wind. The land remembered, though. The sun still kissed it, a pale, indifferent fire. \n\nFolks here, they spoke of a different kind of plenty - organic, they called it. A word that meant something different now. A way to coax life from the ash, to feed the ghosts. A market for it, they said, a hungry maw for the pure and the simple. Eggs, milk, honey - all carried on the backs of weary hands and the dreams of men who still believed in the soil.\n\nThere was a farm, a teardrop of green in the vastness, nestled near the town of Potrero. An old homestead, they said, where shadows danced in the chaparral and the wind carried the ghosts of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. A hundred species, they said, lived there, or at least the remnants of them. A kangaroo rat, a frog, butterflies, a small, gray bird with a song like a sigh. All clinging to life, to the memory of what had been.\n\nThis land, it held memories. A hundred years, maybe more, etched in the dust and the gnarled roots of the oak trees. A place where the wild still whispered, where the echoes of ancient stories lingered. But the whisper was fading, the stories becoming lost. \n\nThe man who dreamt of this farm, he looked at the land with tired eyes. He saw the emptiness, the ghosts of abundance, the fragile life clinging to the edge. He saw a chance, a flicker of hope in the dying light. He saw a way to bring back some of the lost beauty, to feed the ghosts, to keep the whispers alive. He saw a chance to fight against the ash, to plant a seed in the dust.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, carrying whispers of dust and the ghosts of old bargains. Culture, it settled on a man like ash, clinging to his bones, shaping the way he breathed, the way he saw the world. Not a thing you could hold in your hand, no, but a current, a tide pulling at his soul.  It was in the way a man looked at you, the way he held his silence, the way his hand moved to touch his face when he spoke of family. You couldn't judge a man by the dirt on his boots, but you could judge him by the ghosts that rode with him.\n\nThey say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating.  Words like stones tossed carelessly, skipping across the surface of a deep well.  A man's heart held more secrets than any book. To understand him, you had to look beyond the broad strokes, the clichés painted on a canvas too wide to hold the truth. \n\nWhen you crossed into a new land, you saw it through the lens of your own storms, your own sunrises. But the echoes in those eyes, the way they held the weight of a thousand unspoken histories, those belonged to them, not to you. You could learn, though. You could learn the language of their silence, the rhythm of their laughter. You could learn to read the lines on their faces, the stories etched there by the winds of their lives.\n\nAnd in the heart of a negotiation, where the stakes were high and the air thick with unspoken promises, understanding was the only currency that mattered. A man who knew the song of another's soul, who understood the weight of their history, he was a man who could make a deal. He could bridge the chasms of difference, find common ground in the desolate landscape of mistrust.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This echo of Psalm 14 bleeds into the marrow of St. Anselm's bones, his argument a prayer whispered against the encroaching dark. It’s a dark that Thomas Aquinas, too, would find himself wrestling with, each man reaching for the same light, the same God of the Bible, a God whose shape is already etched in their minds. \n\nBut the question burns: Is either man truly illuminating the path, or are they merely tracing shadows? To answer, we must assume, for the sake of this reckoning, that they both see the same God, the God of scripture, the God who breathes life into the dusty pages.  \n\nAnselm’s path is inward, a pilgrimage through the caverns of the soul. He believes God resides within the mind, a truth so self-evident that to doubt him is to deny the very essence of thought itself.  He speaks of faith as a light flickering in the dark, a conviction born not of proof but of the soul’s own knowing. The burden of proof, he suggests, lies not in the external world but in the silence of the heart.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different road. He seeks God’s fingerprint in the world, in the rustling leaves, the turning tide, the very fabric of existence. His five proofs are stones laid in the path, each one a testament to the divine logic that underpins the universe. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony – these are the whispers of God’s hand, the echoes of his presence in the world of sense.  He offers not faith but reason, a map drawn in the language of logic, a blueprint for understanding God through the very world God created.\n\nBut do these paths truly lead to the same destination? Does Anselm’s inward journey illuminate the same God as Aquinas’s outward gaze? Or do they merely offer two different perspectives on the same mystery?  The answer, perhaps, lies not in the certainty of their arguments but in the enduring question they both leave us with: Is there a God who exists beyond the reach of our senses, beyond the grasp of our logic, a God who whispers his truth in the silence of the soul, and who writes his story in the grand tapestry of the universe?",
            "The dust of time had settled on the man's story, obscuring the clarity of his beginnings. Born a prince, they said, he'd walked away from it all.  The world had held him in its sway, but he'd found escape in the silence of his own making. They called him Buddha, a name whispered in the hush of temples and chanted in the wind. He'd gathered his teachings, spun them into threads of wisdom, and woven them into a tapestry known as Dhamma. And from that cloth, a faith was born – Theravada, the ancient way. \n\nBut time, like a river, flows ever onward. The world shifted, the sun rose and set upon a thousand seasons, and the shape of faith changed too. In Sri Lanka, where the echoes of his words still lingered, they held to the water-cutting ceremony. A custom not born of his own lips, yet embraced nonetheless. A shadow of change, flickering in the margins of the ancient light.\n\nThis was not a simple matter of faded robes and altered rituals. It was a deeper thing, a subtle turning within the soul of the faith. The monks, cloaked in saffron, and the laity, their lives interwoven with the fabric of the world, both felt the shift. The doctrines, once stark and clear, began to bend in the wind, their edges softened by the passage of time.\n\nTo understand this, one must first grasp the forces that shaped it. The internal forces, those born from within the community itself, monks and laymen alike. And the external, the voices from beyond the walls of the temple, a chorus of voices, some friendly, some hostile, all seeking to leave their mark.\n\nAt the heart of it all lay the core belief – refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast ocean of wisdom contained in the Tripitaka – the three baskets of scripture. The Suttas, the Vinaya, the Abhidhamma. These texts spoke of impermanence, of suffering, of the endless cycle of rebirth. They spoke of the emptiness of the self, the fire of desire, and the path to liberation. \n\nBut even the most sacred teachings are not immune to change. The world outside, with its shifting sands and restless tides, inevitably found its way in. And within, the human heart, ever yearning and ever changing, sought its own expression. The water-cutting ceremony, a silent testament to this, flowed on, a ripple in the vastness of time.",
            "The border between them, a scar across the land, had bled for fifty-seven years. From 1836 till 1893, the United States and Mexico danced a bloody waltz, a tango of distrust and hate.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high note, the crescendo of this discord, came with the war of 1846. The Americans, hungry and grasping, swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving Mexico drained and broken.   \n\nBut the skirmishes, the whispers of war, had been there long before.  They weren't born from a single cause, but from a tangled web of differences. Religion, culture, the very soul of each nation, clashed against the other. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).  Like a hunter stalking its prey, this blood feud echoed in other borders, in other lands where nations, neighbors, turned on one another. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher, in his study of these tangled affairs, said it plainly: “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Geography, a constant reminder of their proximity, a knife twisting in the wound. \n\nThe weight of religion, a heavy cross, pressed down on their relationship.  Sally Frahm, in her examination of this history, wrote, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). Like the Cold War, another struggle born of ideology, but in this case, it was not communism or capital, but God and faith that stood in the way. The ghosts of the Spanish and English, their old quarrels echoing across generations, poisoned the well of goodwill.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed seventeen disputes, seventeen wounds, in those fifty-seven years. Most were over land, over the shifting sands of borders, over the audacity of bandits who crossed from one side to the other. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The violence, a feral thing, seemed to seep from the land itself. \n\nSchmitt (1974) points out that as Mexico grew dependent on the United States, the animosity waned. The hunger for land was replaced by a hunger for something else, something more insidious: control. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",

            "The way things grow, the way they change... it's a mystery. Even the old books, they barely scratch the surface. Like a man trying to map the dark with a candle's flicker.  D'Arcy Thompson, he said it back in '17, that we ain't even begun to speak the language of life, to capture it in numbers. But maybe now, with these new tools, these equations, we can start to pry open the secrets. We're looking at a kind of shell, a spiral, a Prunum.  It builds itself, layer by layer, over time. And we're trying to see how it does it, what forces pull it this way, what boundaries hold it back. We take pictures, X-rays, to see the bones inside, the structure. Then we feed those pictures into a machine, a  thing called CerioShell. It can build shells, not real ones, but  shadows, possibilities.  \n\nIt's like looking at a river carving its way through stone. You can see the ripples, the bends, the way the water wears away the rock.

            "The dust of mortality hung heavy over Indonesia. The children, the frailest reeds in the field of life, withered still, their numbers clinging to the same grim tally for a decade. Though the land had made strides on some paths – water, sanitation, a semblance of progress – the road to healthy mothers and children remained choked with thorns. They aimed for a finish line in 2015, a phantom date in a fog of want. But the truth, etched in the quiet despair of a mother's eyes, was that the race was far from won. \n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, a figure that shimmered on the page, 72% now. But those numbers were hollow. Did they include the women who knew the ways of the world but not the ways of medicine? Did they count the midwives, who could soothe a birth but not staunch a hemorrhage?  Even the numbers whispered of a deeper truth: the mothers, the blood-soaked vessels of life, were left to bleed in the shadows. \n\nDiarrhea, the scourge of the young, stalked the land, but even when it gripped a child, the reach of a doctor's hand was often too short. Postnatal care, a fragile promise whispered to new mothers, was a threadbare blanket in a cold world.\n\nCesarean sections, a last resort, a lifeline in a storm, were scarce. 4%. A whisper of a chance in a land where life hung by a thread.  The city, a beacon of hope, boasted 7%, while the countryside, a shadowed valley, offered only 2%. The chasm between them was a canyon of despair, a testament to the uneven hand of progress.\n\nAnd then there was the question of equity, the unspoken ache in the heart of the nation.  The poorest, those who could least afford it, were locked out of the sanctuaries of healing. A 27% gap. A chasm of opportunity, of life.\n\nSo they stood at a crossroads. Should they build more roads, more clinics, more programs? Or should they build a stronger foundation, a system that could withstand the storms of poverty and neglect? \n\nThe allure of quick fixes, of targeted solutions, was strong. But history whispered a warning.  Programs, like children, could grow too tall, too quickly, and topple.  Resources, like water, could be diverted to the highest bidder, leaving the parched land to wither.\n\nThe answer, the old men said, lay not in a single solution but in a web of care, woven strong and deep. A system that nurtured not just bodies but spirits, that reached into the shadows and pulled forth the forgotten, the abandoned. A system that held up a mirror to the nation and dared it to see itself, not as it was, but as it could be.",
            "The world of Victorian novels is a place of meticulous detail, a world where the aristocracy reigns supreme. Yet, within this tapestry of societal norms, two tales emerge, defying the rigid conventions of their time: <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Both novels weave through the darkness, venturing into the labyrinth of mystery and the realm of the bizarre, offering a glimpse into the tormented souls that inhabit them. This unsettling departure from the expected strengthens the narrative, illuminating the characters' motivations and exposing the depths of their emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from <i>Oliver Twist</i>: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese dreamlike visions, recurring throughout the novel, offer a glimpse into the recesses of Oliver's tormented soul. They reveal his pain, his confusion, and his growing awareness of the harsh reality that surrounds him.  The shooting, when revisited in chapter 28, unfolds as a vivid hallucination, mirroring Oliver's desperate struggle for survival. The passage emphasizes the overwhelming sense of powerlessness that consumes him. His senses are numbed as he is carried away by an unseen force, unable to control his fate. The pain, constant and relentless, becomes a chilling reminder of his vulnerability. \n\nOliver's helplessness begs the question: who is truly in control of his destiny? Is it his own, or is he merely a pawn in the hands of fate, manipulated by the cruel machinations of others, particularly the menacing figure of Fagin? This brutal reality shatters any illusions of agency, leaving Oliver adrift in a sea of despair.\n\n\nIn Emily Brontë's *Wuthering Heights*, the use of mystery and the macabre takes on a different form, often manifesting as haunting premonitions and spectral presences. \n\n\nThe pervasive darkness of the Yorkshire moors, the wild passions of the characters, and the lingering shadows of the past all contribute to a sense of unease that permeates the narrative. This haunting atmosphere serves to amplify the characters' internal struggles, blurring the lines between reality and madness. \n\n\nLike Oliver Twist, *Wuthering Heights* confronts themes of social injustice and the destructive consequences of unchecked desire. However, the novel's exploration of these themes is more complex and multifaceted, delving into the darker recesses of the human psyche.",
            "The dust of the after school settled as I watched him, Adrian. Maybe third, maybe fourth grade, lost in a world of letters that didn't seem to make sense. He'd pronounce some right, others like a stranger speaking a foreign tongue. It was a puzzle, because the boy spoke English clear as day.  His skin, the color of sun-baked clay, held the stories of a heritage not his own, a language humming just beneath the surface. I knew then, as clear as the desert sky, that the problem wasn't in his knowing, but in the knowing he lacked.\n\nHis mother came then, a woman of shadows and whispers, her words a storm of wind I couldn't grasp. My Spanish, a meager shield against a torrent, barely held. But in the broken fragments, the truth surfaced. He read, he just didn't know the alphabet. The English one. The ghost of a smile crossed my face, a beacon in the fog.\n\nAdrian, he was fine. He just needed a map, a guide to navigate the strange terrain of letters. A simple thing, really. But for the countless others, the children swallowed by the vastness of a language not their own, the path is long and winding. There's no single key, no magic spell to unlock the door. It takes a chorus of voices, a symphony of approaches.\n\nWe need the dual language system, a bridge between worlds. Not just for the Spanish speakers, but for every child, a tapestry woven with threads of understanding. We need tutors, guides, beacons in the linguistic darkness. We need immersion, a baptism in the language of opportunity.\n\nThe fear, the whispers of wasted resources, they are the ghosts of indifference.  The answer lies not in isolation, but in communion, in the shared language of learning. The future, the children, they are the hostages of this silence. Let us be their translators, their guides, their voices in the wilderness.",
            "The rain fell hard on the tin roof, a steady drumbeat against the silence that had settled in. It was the kind of rain that washed away the world, leaving only the grey sky and the slick, dark wood of the porch. We sat there, my father and I, two shadows against the flickering light of the porch lamp. He held a cigarette between his fingers, the ember a red eye in the gloom, and stared out at the world dissolving in the storm.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice hoarse, as if unused. His eyes, though, were on something else, some place beyond the rain, beyond the porch, beyond the world I knew.  A place I couldn't see. \n\nHe had grown thin, his clothes hanging loose on his frame like rags on a skeleton. The hair that was once thick and dark was now sparse, a thin dusting across his scalp. He looked old, ancient, his face etched with the lines of a life lived hard.\n\nHe didn't look at me, didn't meet my eyes. He just kept staring out at the rain, his gaze fixed on something unseen. I wanted to ask him about it, about the place his eyes were focused on, but the words wouldn't come. The silence was heavy, thick with unspoken things, with the fear that coiled tight in my gut.  I knew he was fading, slipping away, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nInstead, I leaned closer, drew in a breath of the damp air, and let the silence wash over us.  We sat there together, two souls adrift in the storm, each searching for a light in the dark.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel, in its very name, is a contradiction: \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt aptly describes it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*.  It's been dismissed, lauded, accused of shallowness, and hailed for its \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the genre, wove together threads from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new literary path. He blended \"old\" theatrical flourishes with the \"new\" realism of the novel, crafting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).  The Gothic, it seems, always walks a tightrope between the echoes of medieval gothic theater, architecture, and lore, and the burgeoning anxieties of the modern age. Even in Walpole's time, \"Gothic\" carried baggage - archaic, unsophisticated, a relic of bygone eras pitted against the perceived progress of the modern world.\n\nThis collision of the theatrical Gothic and the intimate, psychological scope of the novel is what has granted it such enduring power, making it both timeless and strangely alien to the reader separated by centuries.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval code of knighthood, its rituals and ideals, is both evoked and twisted in *The Castle of Otranto*.  Chivalry becomes a touchstone for Gothic writers precisely because of what it represented: the ideal knight, brave, honorable, competent - a stark contrast to the perceived failings of contemporary society.  Through chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" is idealized, romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism.  It's a yearning for a lost moral compass, a way to mend the perceived flaws of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have been grappling with a sense of societal decay.  He may have seen in the idealized \"goodness\" of the past a reflection of a world lost. This is reflected in characters like Frederic. Even before we meet him, we're told he embodies chivalric virtues:\n\n[Walpole's description of Frederic here, focusing on his noble lineage, tragic past, and assumed chivalric qualities]\n\nThe description is laced with chivalric imagery, reinforcing Frederic's status as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that, exaggerated to Gothic extremes, foreshadows the excess that characterizes the genre (66).",
            "The road to a thing, it ain't a straight line.  It twists and turns, like the path of some lost soul. It starts with a whisper, a need in the belly of the customer, a want for something unseen. Then it bleeds into the raw, the bones of the earth, the dust and grit of the materials.  It rumbles through factories, a churning heart of production, where men and machines toil in a rhythmic dance of creation.  Each part a cog in a vast machine, each link in a chain stretching back to the very source. They call it supply chain, this intricate web of movement and exchange. The man who first spoke the name, Oliver, he saw it as a river, flowing from the customer's hand, to the outstretched hand of the provider.\n\nSix pillars hold it up: production, the beating heart; supply, the steady pulse; inventory, the gathered hoard; location, the chosen ground; transportation, the restless wings; and information, the whispering wind that guides it all.  \n\nProduction, that's where the story begins.  It's the forge, the anvil where the raw material is shaped into something new. Managers, they are the architects, the smiths who plan and build, guided by the whispers of the market. They sniff the air, they feel the pulse of the people, they know what is wanted before it's even spoken. They decide what to build, how much, and where, each choice echoing through the chain. \n\nThen comes the supply, the gathering of the pieces, the building of the network.  A symphony of partnerships, each player with their own role, their own expertise. Some stay close, others are scattered far and wide.  It's a delicate balance, this dance of near and far, of closeness and distance.  Managers, they are the conductors, guiding the flow, keeping the rhythm steady.\n\nAnd so it goes, each link in the chain, each step in the journey, a testament to the human desire to build, to connect, to create.  It's a cold, hard world out there, but these chains, they bind us, they give us purpose, they remind us that we are not alone in the darkness.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, a ragged piece of cardboard held aloft by the actress. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it proclaimed in jagged black letters. Ellen Page, face pale beneath the harsh fluorescent glare of the streetlight, stood alone, a solitary figure against the backdrop of indifferent city sprawl. Burma, they called it now, but the old name, Myanmar, still clung to the tongue like a forgotten ghost. A place shrouded in a perpetual dusk, ruled by men who wore the shadows like a shroud.\n\nThey came to power in a whisper, a coup that stole the dawn, a junta that bled the country dry. In '07, a flicker of defiance ignited. Monks, clad in saffron robes, their faces etched with the weight of a thousand years of suffering, took to the streets. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a wave of orange and gold crashing against the iron fist of the regime.\n\nThe wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of ash and decay.  A dead city, choked by dust and silence. The monks, their prayers echoing in empty streets, were met with a hail of bullets. The world looked away. Journalists, their notebooks filled with whispered horrors, were snatched from the shadows, their voices silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking truth, paid the ultimate price, his camera a silent witness to the carnage.\n\nBut the whispers persist. \"Thirteen dead,\" they say, the official lie.  Colonel Hla Win, a ghost from a broken army, spoke of thousands, their bodies lost in the dust and the dark. A darkness that stains the soul of those who harbor it.\n\nRome, its emperors draped in the robes of divinity, crushed dissent beneath their gilded sandals. Japan, its emperors worshipped as gods, wielded power with the cold precision of a samurai blade.

A sea of humanity, yearning for freedom, drowned in a tide of steel and fire.  Rwanda, where the blood of brothers and sisters flowed like a river, turning a nation crimson. And Hitler's shadow, a specter that haunts the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents, but chapters in a grim and enduring story. The story of power, of greed, of the unending struggle for control. A story that plays out on a stage of broken promises and shattered dreams. A story that, if we are not vigilant, will continue to unfold, generation after generation, until the world itself is consumed by the darkness.",
            "The man sat in the dim light, the red glow of the embers casting long shadows on the cracked floorboards. He thought of Duke Ellington. A name whispered through the years, a ghost in a smoky room. His music, a tapestry woven of strings and brass, a symphony of sorrow and hope. Like the rhythm of a heart, steady and sure, a testament to the enduring spirit of man. \n\nHe remembered hearing it once, years ago, a distant echo in a forgotten time. The music had seeped into him, a balm for a soul weary from the road. The melody, it whispered of lost loves and forgotten dreams, of cities bathed in moonlight and streets choked by dust. It spoke of a world that was, and a world that might yet be.\n\nHe touched the worn leather of his guitar case, its battered surface a map of his travels. His fingers traced the inscription etched on the inside: \"Music is the language of the soul.\" A gift from his father, a man who had understood the power of a song to bridge the chasm between hearts. \n\nHe closed his eyes and let the music rise within him, a phantom orchestra playing in the silence. A mournful saxophone wail, a piano's melancholic sigh, the rhythmic pulse of a bass line grounding him in the present. It was a sound that transcended time and place, a universal language that spoke to the depths of his being.\n\nHe knew, in that moment, that the music would endure. It would outlive him, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. A flickering flame in the darkness, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by despair.",
            "The hunger gnawed at her, a constant ache in the hollow of her chest. It wasn't hunger for food or drink, but for something else, something she couldn't name. It had begun when she was a girl, barely thirteen, a whisper in the back of her mind that grew louder with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, it roared like a desert wind, a yearning for something she couldn't grasp. \n\nShe'd tried to pin it down, this elusive want. Boys had come and gone, drawn to her like moths to a flame, but none ignited the spark within her. Their clumsy attempts at courtship fell flat, leaving her with a sense of detachment, of being an island in a sea of indifference. What was wrong with her? How could she be so untouched at this age? The question haunted her, a dull ache in the corners of her mind.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a symphony of normalcy played out in the hushed tones of her parents' voices. They were good people, her parents, their lives woven together in a tapestry of quiet contentment. Arguments were as rare as rainstorms in the desert, and even when they occurred, they faded quickly, leaving no trace. Yet, she, their daughter, was a storm in their calm sea. Her laughter rang out, her energy a vibrant counterpoint to their measured lives. They loved her fiercely, bewildered by her tempestuous spirit.\n\nBut today, the quiet was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice strained with pain, sliced through the stillness. Fear, cold and sharp, pricked at her. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow...sweetheart, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words broken and ragged.  \n\nHer daughter's heart hammered against her ribs. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, her voice a thin thread. Relief washed over her. At least she knew what to do. She carried her mother, a weight heavier than she'd ever imagined, to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, the scent of disinfectant and sterile fear clinging to the air. She barely registered the worried faces that gathered around her mother. All she could think about was getting her mother help.\n\nLater, the doctor explained that her mother had fallen from a stepladder, reaching for a vase on a high shelf. It wasn't serious, but serious enough to warrant a visit to the hospital. \n\nShe sat beside her mother's bed, relief washing over her in waves. The hunger, for a moment, seemed to recede, replaced by a deep, abiding love. Maybe, she thought, this was the thing she'd been searching for all along.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the weathered faces of the women, their eyes the color of a long-forgotten sea. They spoke of a way of living, a diet of sun-baked earth and the bounty of the sea. The \"Mediterranean,\" they called it, a way of life woven into the fabric of their being. They spoke of olive oil shimmering like liquid gold, of fish pulled from the depths, of fruits bursting with the sweetness of the sun. They spoke of grains, the lifeblood of their sustenance, and beans, the humble earth's offering. \n\nThese women, gathered under a sky bleached white by time, carried knowledge passed down through generations. They believed that this way of eating, this \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" as they called it, held the promise of a longer life, a life free from the grip of the heart's burden. Theirs was a way of life that whispered of resilience, a resistance against the slow decay, the creeping shadows of illness. They watched as the sun dipped below the horizon, staining the sky the color of blood, and they knew. They knew that their way was a shield against the encroaching darkness.\n\n\nThis study, a whisper in the vast landscape of time, sought to unravel the secrets of their wisdom. It followed the lives of these women, their bodies etched with the stories of their years, their faces reflecting the sun's relentless gaze. They carefully documented the women's every bite, their every sip, their every movement. They tracked the ebb and flow of life, the rise and fall of illness, the stark reality of death. \n\nAnd they found, in the quiet spaces between the records, a truth that resonated with the ancient wisdom of the women. A truth whispered on the wind, a truth etched in their very being. The \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" they found, was a promise whispered on the wind, a beacon in the darkness. It was a way of life that offered hope, a chance to defy the encroaching shadows.",
            "The year was two thousand seven. The country, it broke. Like an old bone, cracked clean through. The air was choked with ash, the dust of broken dreams and shattered promises.  Men lost their jobs, their houses, their grip on the world. Corporations, once giants, toppled like rotten trees in a storm. A sickness had spread through the veins of the nation, a fever of greed and reckless faith.  \n\nThey say it began in the halls of power, with men in suits and ties, whispering deals in hushed tones. Men who played with money like it was sand, ignoring the warnings, the tremors in the earth. They loosened the reins, let the wolves loose, and the wolves devoured the sheep.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were the shepherds, or pretended to be. They gathered up the frail mortgages, the bad debts, and stitched them into bundles, wove them into securities, traded them like weapons.  They called them CDOs, CDSs - fancy names for poisoned fruit.\n\nThe borrowers, they were the ones who paid the price. Many of them, good folk, honest folk, were lured in by promises of easy money. They signed on the dotted line, unaware of the trap, unaware of the storm brewing on the horizon.  They thought they were building a future, but they were building their own coffin.\n\nThe day came when the music stopped. The houses that were once castles crumbled, and the wolves, they turned on each other, their fangs bared in a frenzy of fear and desperation.\n\nWall Street, the heart of the beast, bled. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch - giants fallen. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, they limped away, scarred and broken. Fannie and Freddie, their bones picked clean, were left in the dust. \n\nThe nation, it staggered, bruised and bleeding. The air was thick with the smell of ash and regret.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a shroud over the remnants of a world long gone.  It clung to the back of his throat like a bad memory.  He knew he should tell her, lay it all out: the meeting at the diner, greasy spoon with chipped Formica, him slumped over a lukewarm coffee, her sunlight smile cutting through the gloom.  The way she'd laughed at his joke, the one about the air force and the gas station, a joke born of bitterness and resignation.  The marriage, a quick affair in a courthouse, no fanfare, just two souls seeking warmth in the cold, empty spaces of their lives.\n\nBut the words wouldn't come.  They'd choke him, tangle in his throat like the barbed wire at the edge of the road.  Better to let her see, to feel the weight of his past in the way his hand unconsciously tightened around the pistol grip, in the shadow that lingered in his eyes, a ghost of a life lost.  He'd show her through the silences, the unspoken truths etched in the lines of his face, the weariness in his gait.  Let her piece together the fragments of his story, the echoes of laughter and love, the sting of loss and regret, just as he'd pieced together hers.\n\nThey'd find their own rhythm, their own way of breathing in this world stripped bare, where the wind carried the scent of ashes and the ghosts of a thousand dreams.",
            "The news from Columbus bled slow and gray across the screen. Two broadcasts this morning, both swallowed by the day like dust devils in the heat. The first, NBC 4, a flickering image of a man named Shad Hostettler. His eyes, two black pits in a skull of bone, stared out from a mugshot. Ashley, Ohio. A wife stabbed. A story barely whispered, two minutes sold to the hungry maw of the midday hours. \n\nThe second, a young man named Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot down in the Sharon Woods. No suspects, no answers, just the hollow echo of a SWAT team's boots on pavement. A black boy, a name forgotten, a life snuffed out. The news moved on, the world uncaring.\n\nA shot in the Med-Flight, a .22 whisper against steel, a five thousand dollar promise for a whisper back. UDF robbed, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie. A body type, an accent, a color.  A story told in shades of fear. Rene Rodriguez, a Texas kingpin, 300 months to pay for his sins. Hispanic, they said. The words hung heavy in the air.\n\nThe rain was coming, a curtain of water promised for Saturday. The weatherman, a voice like a tired sigh, spoke of heat and humidity. A teaser for a storm, a mere breath before the deluge.",
            "The blood ties bind, they hold fast. A brother to his brother. A knot woven tight with threads of love and anger, envy and pain.  They see themselves reflected in each other’s eyes, the good and the bad, the light and the dark. It’s in the face of ruin that this bond reveals its true nature. A stark truth laid bare. A cost to be paid. \n\nUnderstanding this bond, this tangle of emotions, means understanding the price. To look into a brother’s eyes and see not what they want you to see, but the raw truth, the soul laid open. That’s where the reckoning lies. What they do, what they are. \n\nIn “The Scarlet Ibis”, two boys, bound by blood and circumstance, test this truth. Against a backdrop of a world both beautiful and brutal, they embark on a journey that ends in tragedy. Pride, bitter and sharp, clashes with a love that can’t quite grasp its own strength. Only one survives the storm.\n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, his heart a tangled knot of feelings. It’s his pride, his need to be seen as strong, that drives him. He wants a brother to share his adventures, to run and climb and race with.  But Doodle, his younger brother, is frail, a whisper of a boy against the backdrop of a world that demands strength.  Doodle is a weight, a burden, a constant reminder of the brother he never wanted. The narrator's thoughts, his memories, paint a picture of a boy struggling to reconcile his love for his brother with the resentment he feels. The world he sees, the way he reacts to it, all are shaped by this conflict.\n\t\nHe yearns to teach Doodle, to prove his own worth. He wants to drag him into the world he knows, but Doodle is a fragile thing.  The narrator's memories, his very words, reveal a darkness within him, a fleeting thought of ending Doodle’s life before it truly begins. But then Doodle smiles, and the darkness recedes. The love, the instinctive bond, lingers.",
            "The skull, a cold and empty thing. Inside, a storm of phantoms.  They called it the brain, this engine of thought, this labyrinth of fire and wire.  It had once been likened to a wax tablet, a parchment scroll, a book bound in bone.  Now, they spoke of it as a machine, a cold calculating thing of gears and circuits. But the brain, it knows no such things. It weaves its own tapestry, a dark and intricate web spun from sensation and memory.  It takes the raw materials of the world – the touch of wind, the sting of rain, the taste of ash – and shapes them into its own desolate landscape.\n\nThe senses, they are the gateways.  They flood the mind with a torrent of data, a cacophony of light and sound and scent. The brain, it sifts through the noise, a scavenger picking through the ruins. It builds its own maps, its own narratives. A shadow flickers across the wall, a whisper in the dark. The brain, it seizes on these fragments, weaving them into a story, a phantom of meaning.\n\nThe attention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it fades.  It chooses what to see, what to hear, what to remember. The world is a flood of stimuli, but the mind, it can only hold a drop or two. A name, a face, a touch. The rest, it slips away, lost in the shadows.\n\nAnd then, the memory.  A fragile thing, a wisp of smoke in the wind. It clings to the brain, clinging to the edges of consciousness.  It can be recalled, a glimpse into the past, a phantom of what was. But time, it is a relentless tide. It washes away the memories, leaving only fragments, echoes of a forgotten dream.\n\nThey say the brain is a machine. A tool. But it is more than that. It is a prison, a sanctuary, a battlefield. It is the seat of our hopes and fears, our dreams and nightmares. It is the engine of our humanity, a fire burning in the darkness.",
            "The glass world shimmered, a cold, bright carapace over the ashes of what had been. Huxley saw it coming, the creeping tendrils of technology and the iron fist of capitalism strangling the soul of man. In his Brave New World, happiness was a drug, a chemical concoction dispensed by the World Controller, a puppeteer pulling the strings of a million minds. Community, conformity, and the relentless churn of consumption – these were the pillars of a society built on illusion. \n\nMarx's specter haunted Huxley's pages. Homogeny, reification, the tools of a system designed to grind individuals into indistinguishable cogs.  The proletariat, those trapped in the gears of the machine, were kept blind to their true condition. Hypnopædia, the insidious art of programming dreams, instilled in them the desire for fleeting pleasures, the insatiable hunger for more. The World Controller, a god in a chrome and glass temple, whispered his desires into their waking moments, shaping their thoughts, their wants, their very identities.\n\nHuxley's critique was a scalpel, dissecting the lie of false consciousness. The masses, shackled by their own contentment, were unaware of the architect of their gilded cage. Hegemony, the invisible hand that steered them, was the weapon of the ruling class, a subtle manipulation that ensured their continued dominance. The Alphas and Betas, the architects of this manufactured happiness, were complicit in the system, their own desires muted by the comforts of their position. The lower castes, the Deltas and Gammas, were mere puppets, dancing to the tune of a master they could not see.\n\nLove, individuality, spontaneity – these were relics of a bygone age, discarded in the pursuit of order and efficiency.  The characters, mere shadows in a sterile landscape, were devoid of depth, their interactions shallow and transactional. Huxley painted a picture of a world where human connection had been replaced by a cold, calculated efficiency. He warned us of a future where technology, unchecked by conscience, would erode the very essence of what it meant to be human.",
            "The asphalt stretched before him, cracked and gray, a serpent winding through the skeletal trees. Four and a half semesters. That's how long he'd been a prisoner in this concrete valley they called University Park. East Halls, they called it. A cage at the edge of things, a purgatory of endless walks. Willard, a distant god in the heart of the campus, a pilgrimage in the teeth of the wind. He'd heard tales, whispers from those who'd come before, of when the land stretched empty, a wilderness of forgotten dreams. Now, it was choked with brick and concrete, a monument to progress, a labyrinth of its own making.\n\nHe'd spoken to a ghost, an alum, a shade from a forgotten era, and the man had spoken of a simpler time. When the bike was king, a whisper in the wind, a passage across the barren plains. Now, the bike was a relic, a forgotten weapon in the war for space.\n\nBut the man's words echoed still, a ghost in his own mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, eyes clouded with the memory of a lost freedom. \"It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nHe knew it was true. He'd felt the power of the wheels beneath him, the wind whipping past, the freedom in his own two legs. \n\nHe lived now beyond the edges of the campus, a nomad in a land of stones and steel, a shadow in the fading light. A bike, he thought, that's what he needed. A way to reclaim his stolen time, to escape the endless march of asphalt and brick. Pollock Road beckoned, a ribbon of black leading to the heart of the warren. A challenge, a test of will.\n\nHe could walk. He could fight his way through the throngs of humanity, the endless tide of bodies. But he wanted more. He wanted to fly.\n\nHe'd heard the whispers, the legends of the bike, the whispers of a time when the campus was a place of wind and trees, not concrete and steel. He yearned for that time, for that freedom."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The road stretched on, gray and ashen, the dust kicked up by a wind that carried the silence of the grave. It was a road that led nowhere, but it was the only road I knew. The city, a burnt husk, was a phantom memory, a ghost town in the wasteland. I had seen too much of that kind of emptiness, too much of the hollow stares of the abandoned.  \n\nThis road, it led to a different kind of emptiness, the kind that settled deep in your bones, the kind that gnawed at the heart. The kind that only a child's eyes could pierce. Those eyes, wide and innocent, looking for a flicker of hope, a spark of light in the growing darkness.\n\nThey say there’s a fire in every heart. But mine, it felt like a dying ember, threatened by the ever-present chill. I could still remember the heat of another fire, though, a fire of rage that burned in my gut that day I stood on the porch, watching the boy sit on the edge of the couch, his face pale and drawn. His words, whispered through choked sobs, echoed in my ears: \"They're hurting me.\" \n\nThat's when I decided to fight. Not with fists or guns, but with the only weapon I had left: my will. I would be his shield, his protector. I would be the voice for those who had no voice.\n\nThe road stretched on, and the wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. But somewhere, deep inside, the ember flickered. It was a small flame, but it was enough. Enough to keep me going, enough to keep me fighting for the boy, for the hope that maybe, just maybe, we could find a place where the sun still shone.",
            "The dust of affliction. That's what insomnia is, a slow, creeping dust that settles in the bones, the mind, the very marrow of a man. Some say it's in the blood, a curse woven into the fibers of your being. A legacy inherited from some long-dead ancestor who knew the cold grip of sleepless nights. Others say it's the world that's to blame, the weight of it pressing down, a shroud of worry and hardship woven from the fabric of society itself.\n\nThey call these the biological and sociocultural models, each trying to lay claim to the darkness that steals sleep. The biological folks, they talk of genes, of wiring in the brain gone awry. They point to the hypothalamus, a tiny part of the brain that acts like a switchboard for sleep and wakefulness, and they tell stories of neurons firing out of sync, of orexin, a chemical messenger, failing to do its job. They speak of mice, of experiments, of receptors and agonists, words that sound like whispers from the dark. They say a man's fate is written in his genes, that sleeplessness is a burden passed down through generations, a darkness inherited.\n\nThe others, the sociocultural folks, they look at the world outside the skull. They see the burdens of race and class, the weight of poverty and oppression, the gnawing anxieties of a world gone mad. They say that insomnia is not just a disease of the body, but a disease of the soul, a symptom of a society that forgets the simple human need for rest. They see the city lights, the endless hum of technology, the relentless pressure to perform, and they say, This is the world that steals sleep.\n\nBoth sides offer their explanations, their pieces of the puzzle. But the truth, it's probably somewhere in the shadows, a tangled knot of biology and circumstance, of genes and environment, of the whispers in the blood and the weight of the world.  And maybe, just maybe, the answer lies not in finding a cure, but in learning to live with the darkness, to find peace in the sleepless night.",

A wasteland, silent save for the whisper of the wind and the distant, mournful cry of a crow.  This was the country of sounds uncaught, of words lost in the echoing emptiness. Here, in this desolate place, lived a boy and a man, bound together by a whispered word, a shared burden. The boy, with eyes wide and watchful, strained to hear the world around him, but the sounds were fragmented, incomplete.  His world was a tapestry woven with gaps, threads of sound tangled and broken.  This was the mark of the Silent World, a place where the ear heard but the mind could not grasp. \n\nThe man, his face etched with the weariness of a long road traveled, knew the boy's struggle.  He had seen it in the boy's frustration, in the way he would tilt his head, straining to catch the missing pieces of the spoken word.  He knew the boy's world was fractured, a mosaic of sound, incomplete and disjointed. This was the burden he carried, the burden of the Silent World.\n\nThey journeyed together, father and son, across this desolate landscape, their steps echoing on the cracked earth. The man, a silent guardian, watched over the boy, shielding him from the harshness of their reality.

He spoke slowly, carefully, ensuring each word reached the boy's ears, each syllable a precious offering in a world where words could vanish like smoke on the wind.\n\nThey moved from place to place, seeking refuge in the remnants of a shattered world.

He knew the dangers of the Silent World, the predators who preyed on the vulnerable, the whispers of madness that could consume those who could not find their place in the world.\n\nHe held onto the hope that one day, the boy would find his voice, that the shattered pieces of his world would come together, forming a whole.  He held onto the hope that they could find a place where the silence wouldn't be so deafening, where the boy could hear the music of the world, the symphony of life playing out around them.",
            "The play unfolds like a shroud, revealing a truth that clings to the edges of deception. Twelfth Night whispers that disguise, a web spun fine and tight, can shelter a soul from harm but in the end, the threads must unravel. For a man or woman who lives in borrowed skin risks becoming lost, a ghost in a mask.\n\nThe rub lies in the tearing away. To uncloak is to face the chill of exposure, the judgment of those whose trust has been betrayed. Some may bear it, some may not.  Relationships, fragile things, can shatter under the weight of a revealed lie.\n\nGender, a slippery thing, becomes a quicksand in this play. Why, one wonders, would a soul choose to drown in the sea of another's identity? Viola, adrift in a foreign land, seeks refuge in the armor of masculinity. She declares, “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nBut her guise, crafted for survival, becomes a cage. She is cut off from the solace of her own kind, her feminine strength rendered invisible.  And in the mist of this masquerade, Olivia, entangled in a web of her own, mistakes Viola for a man, mistaking the reflection for the source.  “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). \n\nOrsino, too, is drawn into the dance, confessing to Viola/Cesario, “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).  Is this a progressive yearning for a love beyond convention? Or is it a reflection of the human heart, forever searching, forever seeking what it cannot name?\n\nOlivia’s swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, her acceptance of Viola as sister rather than lover, speaks of a society where appearances hold sway. Is she truly prejudiced against women? Or is she merely a product of her time, blind to the truth that lies beneath the surface?\n\nTwelfth Night, a play of shadows and light, exposes the human heart's capacity for both deceit and yearning. It reminds us that truth, like a fragile butterfly, must be handled with care, for its wings are easily broken.",
            "The land was marked by the ghosts of its own making. The skeletal bones of trees, bleached white against the dust-choked sky, spoke of a violence done, of a fire that had raged and consumed. This was German South West Africa, a place where the whispers of genocide still clung to the air, a stench of ash and sorrow clinging to the wind.  The Ovaherero and Nama, their names like broken promises, were swallowed by the earth, their spirits scattered on the plains.\n\nBut empires, even those stained with blood, weren't uniform.  Their shadows stretched long and twisted, casting different hues across their domains.  In Tanganyika, where the British later took root, they found a people who had tasted the bitter fruit of knowledge.  Schools, built by the Germans, stood as monuments to a different, perhaps more humane, vision.  In Kamerun and other corners, the whispers spoke of education, of progress, a faint echo of a forgotten dream.\n\nBut here, in this desolate kingdom, a different story unfolded.  The Germans, they came with promises of civilization, of progress, but their gaze fell upon the native souls with a cold indifference.  Education, for them, was a luxury reserved for the conquerors, not the conquered. The task of shaping minds was left to the missionaries, their words a flickering candle in the vast darkness.\n\nThe iron fist of the state, so strong in other colonies, was loose here.  The government, content to hoard its resources, turned a blind eye to the plight of the natives, their fate a matter of indifference.  Schools for the white settlers, those who claimed ownership of this barren land, were meticulously crafted, their halls echoing with the pronouncements of a superior race.  But the native children, their eyes filled with the despair of a forgotten world, were left to tread the dusty paths of ignorance.\n\nThis, then, was the legacy of German rule in South West Africa: a chasm of inequality, a scar etched deep into the soul of the land.  The echoes of their cruelty still reverberated through the ages, a testament to the enduring damage inflicted by the hunger for power and dominion.",
            "The air hangs thick with the sound of a hundred names, a hundred faces, a hundred stories crowding in on themselves. Popular music. A sprawling landscape, a graveyard of ghosts, all clamoring for a place in the sun. Rock, blues, country, folk, each a tattered banner waving in the wind, each a wound bleeding out its own unique song. And somewhere in that chaos, a knot of darkness tightened, a fist clenched around a microphone, a scream echoing through the canyons of sound. That was metal.\n\nForty years gone, and it's grown like a tumor, a cancer of the soul, branching and burrowing, feeding on the raw nerves of the world.  Subgenres bloom like mushrooms in the dark, each one a reflection of some inner hunger, some private hell.  Heavy metal, they called it, a name that whispered of doom and defiance.\n\nIt's a music born of shadows, a symphony of dissonance. More bass, more volume, more fury. A shriek of guitars, drums like thunderclaps, a voice that rips through the silence like a banshee.  A hunger for something primal, something real, something that could shake the very foundations of the world.\n\nIt's a music of excess, a testament to the limits of human endurance.  Drugs a fuel, a catalyst, a mask for the demons that danced in the shadows.  A generation fueled by the fires of rebellion, searching for meaning in a world that had turned its back on them. \n\nThey took the darkness, the rage, the despair, and they poured it into the music.  They borrowed from the past, from the Romantics who wept for the beauty of decay, from the bluesmen who sang of heartbreak and loss, from the ancient myths that whispered of gods and monsters.  They wove it all together into a tapestry of sound, a dark and glorious tapestry that reflected the broken world around them.\n\nThere's a line in a song, a line that captures the essence of it all: \"Helter Skelter.\" The Beatles, they called it. A glimpse into a world teetering on the edge, a world drowning in its own madness. It wasn't just the music, it was the message.  A scream into the void, a plea for something more.\n\nAnd it found its echo in the hearts of those who felt lost, those who craved something more than the mundane, something that could make them feel alive.",
            "The year was 1910. Henri Rousseau, a man haunted by dreams both literal and figurative, set his brush to canvas. The Dream, the painting he birthed, wasn't just a woman lost in a fantastical landscape. It was Rousseau’s soul laid bare, a testament to the internal struggle that gnawed at him. For years, he'd dreamt of the art world’s embrace, of the whispers of praise, the murmur of recognition. But the path to such acclaim seemed blocked, a thorny thicket of convention and expectation.  He yearned to be seen, but could he be seen for who he truly was, or would he be forced to bend his vision to the will of the critics he so desperately sought to please?\n\nBefore you can truly understand The Dream, you need to know the man behind the brush. Henri Rousseau, born in the year 1844, was a man of humble beginnings. His father, a tinsmith, toiled for a living, and young Henri was raised in the shadow of his father's modest prosperity.  He never received formal training in art, instead finding himself bound to a life of public service, a gabelou, a toll collector for the French government. His early years were marked by tragedy, the loss of a wife and eight children leaving him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his solace, a window into a world where his dreams could take flight.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance wasn't born from vanity. He wasn't trying to be the darling of the art world; he simply wanted to be seen, to have his work understood. He was a man of the people, a folk artist who captured their hopes and dreams in his paintings. However, the art world he entered was dominated by artists with pedigrees and connections, artists like Matisse, whose talent was undeniable, whose path to fame seemed easy. Rousseau, a self-taught outsider, felt the weight of their success, the pressure to conform, to mimic their style, to earn a place at their table. The question that haunted him was this: could he find his own voice, his own truth, without losing the very thing he longed for - recognition? \n\nAnd so, within The Dream, we see the reflection of this struggle. It's a painting that speaks not only of a woman lost in a fantastical world, but also of a man lost in the labyrinth of his own desires. A man searching for a place where his dreams could finally take root, where he could finally be seen for the artist he truly was.",
            "The line between what's right and what's fair, they say, it runs thin as a razor. And that notion, it echoes in the silence of a dusty room, in the brushstrokes of a faded canvas. There's a truth to it, a kind of knowing, that hums beneath the surface. Like the sun on a cracked windowpane, it casts a pale light on things we can't quite grasp. \n\nMen have tried to pin it down, this truth, this beauty. Keats, he saw it in a silent urn, a frozen moment of grace. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he wrote. But even in his words, it feels like a whisper on the wind, something glimpsed at the edge of vision. We learn things, sure. We read books, we swallow lessons whole. But this... this is different. \n\nIt's in the way a rain-soaked canvas holds the memory of a storm, in the ache of a melody that speaks to a forgotten longing. It's in the silences between the words, in the spaces where the soul slips through.\n\nWe dissect art, we analyze morals, but the heart of it, the soul of it, that remains elusive. We talk about brushstrokes and composition, about right and wrong, but the essence, the spark, it's always just beyond our reach. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And it's true. Words can stumble, they can fall short. But stories, they hold the weight of unspoken truths, the echoes of a deeper knowing.\n\nAnd ethics? It's the same. We build codes, we argue points, but the true heart of it, that resides in the realm of the unspoken, the ineffable. It's a feeling, a gut-knowing, that transcends the reach of language.\n\nKeats, O'Connor, Wittgenstein, they all sensed it. That something more, that thing that whispers in the darkness, that makes us shiver and sigh and reach for understanding. It's the thread that runs through art and ethics, a connection woven in the fabric of our being. It's the language of the soul.",
            "The ghost of a country, Germany, lingers still. A specter of power, stitched together from the shadows of the Alps where München sleeps, to the salt-laced breath of Kiel on the Baltic. A single soul, beating beneath the weight of its history, felt from the cobbled streets of Köln, down the Rhine to the Saxon city of Dresden, clinging to the Elbe. This Germany, forged in blood and ash, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, whispers its past in every windswept stone.\n\nGermania, the ancestral cradle. The name itself a wound, its origins a maze of contested theories. Tacitus, in his ancient chronicle, claimed it stemmed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed the Rhine before clashing with the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his own testament to conquest, a term to mark the difference between the vanquished Gauls and those who remained free, those who fought under the furs and iron of the north. Some say it came from the Gauls themselves, a word for those who lived beyond the known world. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of this land, of the \"Germans who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" But others whisper of a different origin, a weapon forged in the heart of Germania, the spear known as the \"ger,\" or perhaps a word from the ancient tongue of the Irish, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the thunderous voices of a people who knew only war and freedom.\n\nTacitus, in his own grim testament to the German spirit, wrote of a people untouched by the tide of history, a people who had never left their ancestral lands: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He paints a picture of a land untouched by Rome, a land of wild beauty and harshness, a land where the air itself tasted of iron and frost.  \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive,\" he writes, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"  \n\nAnd indeed, the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, bartered for its riches, and took what they could, but the heart of Germany, its unyielding spirit, remained untamed. The Germanic tribes, ever vigilant, traded their wares and fought in the legions of Rome, forever a thorn in the side of the empire.",
            "The brown water churned, a thick slurry of some nameless thing.  His hand hovered, a pale ghost over the porcelain rim. He didn't look down. Didn't need to. The shape of it was etched already on the back of his eyelids. A stain in the white emptiness. The slick sheen of it, the pale brown fringe. He thought of the artist's book, the one he'd bought on a whim.  \"See the world as a simple shape,\" it said.  A bowl of fruit, a face, a goddamn turd in a bowl. But the world always held more than shapes, didn't it? \n\nHe remembered the quiet days spent poring over those pages, a desperate hunger for understanding gnawing at him.  Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Renaissance riot of color. He'd wanted to find his own palette, his own story.  Maybe it had begun here, in this dim-lit bathroom, with the stench of bleach and despair clinging to the air. \n\nHis hand moved, a twitch of muscle, a spasm of will.  He gripped the handle, a cold metal in his sweaty palm.  He wouldn't flinch.  He wouldn't think. Just move.  A single flush, a gurgle, a sigh of relief.  The shape remained, stubborn and defiant.  He squeezed his eyes shut, willing it away.\n\nHe reached for the mop, the handle slick and damp.  Green tie choking him, he stared at the brown stain.  A single thought, clear and sharp, pierced the fog: This was his canvas, this was his brush, and this goddamn turd was his muse.",
            "The road runs black and slick with the rain. They say the young ones are dying on it, these boys behind the wheel, their blood blooming on asphalt.  A kind of sickness in the blood, that's what it is. The brain, they say, it ain't finished yet. Not ready for the weight of it all.  A machine meant for humming along, carrying dreams and  dead ends, becomes a tomb.\n\n*They* say the numbers tell the story. More accidents, more rollovers, more of them going off the road, lost and foolish.  And they're not alone. The friends, the kin, the damned echoes of youth piling in, turning the car into a cage.\n\nCalifornia, they tried to fix it.  Licenses for the young, a kind of probation,  hours set, passengers banned. A band-aid on a festering wound.\n\nThe truth is, the young ones are wired different. A fire in their bellies, a need to taste the danger. The old man Zuckerman, he says it himself – eighteen's not enough. They crave the rush, the taste of the brink.\n\nAnd what comes next?\n\nMillions more, the boomers' children, all itching to get behind the wheel.  A blood harvest waiting to happen.\n\nThey talk about solutions. Schools, driver's ed, hours of practice. But the real answer, it's a line in the sand.  A line drawn before the fire catches hold.  Not eighteen, not yet.  Wait, let the fire die down.\n\nLet the years pass.  \n\nLet them learn to walk before they run.\n\nLet them learn to live before they die.",
            "The Library of Congress, a vast repository of forgotten things, held a trove of Edison's early films. Among them, fifteen trick films, flickering shadows from the years 1895 to 1901. Illusions woven from the nascent art of editing, they whispered of a time before the moving picture had found its voice. My study of these films sought to unravel the poetics, the common thread that bound them, while also peering into the nascent wrinkles of evolution that creased a few of the later works.\n\nThe trick films of the turn of the century, for the most part, were creatures of constraint. They lived within the confines of a stage, a proscenium frame that held them captive. The camera, a silent observer, never strayed from its fixed position. It was a world of frozen moments, of figures confined to a single plane, moving side to side like ghosts in a box.\n\nThe influence of the stage, of vaudeville and magic, lingered heavy in these films. Actors, bound by the stage's limitations, never ventured towards or away from the camera. Think of \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where the actors, like marionettes, danced along a horizontal axis, never breaking the confines of the frame. \n\nThe world of these trick films was a stage, the camera a distant eye fixed upon it. Long shots, and occasionally medium shots, were all that filled the frame. Close-ups, a language yet to be discovered, were absent. The audience, like those in the old theaters, saw the whole performance laid bare, confined by the proscenium's rigid embrace.\n\nThe films themselves were structured like a single, unbroken breath. Each concept, each trick, was captured in a single shot, a film. This limited their length, their narratives, to the brevity of a fleeting moment.  They were vaudeville sketches, glimpses of magic, disappearing acts, woven together with tricks that defied the eye. But even within this constraint, there were whispers of change. \n\nExamine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, where a single shot is stitched together to create the illusion of a severed head.  A hint, a promise, of a more complex language to come.",
            "John Taylor, a man of Caroline, spoke with the fire of a young Republic in his belly. His life was bound to the soil, a farmer through and through, but the land had forged in him a spirit that echoed in the halls of Congress. He was known for his words, for the way he stood against the tide, a bulwark against what he saw as the encroaching hand of the state.  His faith in the life of the soil, in the sweat of the brow, colored every argument, every conviction. It was this devotion to the farmer, this belief that agriculture was the true backbone of a nation, that fueled his fire on matters of sovereignty, of the very meaning of the Constitution, even the way justice was dispensed.\n\n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to build something different, something better. A clean slate, unburdened by the dead weight of tradition. He believed in the innate rights of man, rights woven into the fabric of existence, rights that were all interconnected, each dependent on the other. If one was trampled, they all withered. These rights, he claimed, were sacred, beyond the reach of any government, any man. He spoke of a \"state of nature,\" a world where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning ruled over virtue. But in a civilized society, he argued, this had to change.\n\nThis ideal society, this haven of liberty, could only be built on a government that understood the duality of man, the inherent good and the ever-present evil. He was a man of stark contrasts, a believer in black and white, in the fundamental nature of good and evil. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.” He defined good principles as those that protected private property, those that nurtured the land, and those that kept the wolf of unchecked capitalism at bay. He believed that a government built on these principles, even if administered by men driven by avarice and self-interest, would somehow find a balance, a way to function fairly. He saw self-interest as the engine of man, a force that could be harnessed for the common good, but that could also lead to chaos if left unchecked.\n\nTaylor was a strict constructionist, a man who believed in the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. He craved a limited federal government, one that held no more power than that explicitly granted to it. He saw a large, expansive government as a threat, a breeding ground for tyranny. But he also feared a blind, literal interpretation of the law, a rigid adherence to words that could twist and turn into something monstrous. He found solace in the Declaration of Independence, a document that, he believed, more clearly articulated the nature of the United States as a union of sovereign states, rather than a single, indivisible nation.",
            "The numbers in Figure 17, they fell off a precipice come the third month. A hard thing to swallow, that. The why of it, though, it's a riddle wrapped in a shroud. Winter's grip on this New England campus, you see, it chills the bones, and folks tend to stay inside. Bikes and footpaths, they fall silent then. And December, that's a month of deadlines and grades, of frantic packing and a desperate clinging to the last embers of freedom before the long holiday break. A commuter log, it's a small thing, easy to forget in the rush. Then the break itself, a month of silence and absence. Not even the ghosts of commuters linger on the paths. January, its return a slow, hesitant bloom, a trickle of life returning to the frozen ground. But February, that was a deeper chill. A hollow space where the numbers should have been.\n\nThere's a weariness to these things, a natural ebb and flow. Like the tide, the initial surge of enthusiasm recedes, leaving behind a quiet stillness. We tried to fight it, to shore up the banks with the Carpool Challenge Week. A blitz, a burst of energy in March, and the numbers rose again, but the underlying current, it remained.\n\nThe truth is, the car, it's a siren song, a deep-rooted yearning for freedom on the open road. It's woven into the very fabric of this society. So, we offered enticements. Gift certificates, a taste of sweetness to draw them in. Restaurants, coffee shops, massages, even books and trinkets. It was a good start, but I wonder, would a bolder gesture have swayed them? A bicycle, a hybrid, a whisper of electric promise. Perhaps a bigger prize, a beacon in the darkness, might have kept the flame alive.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same, a constant hum of reward. But what if they had grown, evolved with the project? A promise of a bicycle in December, a hybrid in January, a whisper of electric freedom in February. Would it have been enough to keep the numbers climbing, to break through the winter's chill?",
            "The road stretched black and empty, a ribbon of ash against the dying light.  An ETF, they called it. A basket of stocks, a gamble cast on the board of the market.  Like a preacher's promise, it whispered of diversification, of low fees, of easy wealth.  But the devil, they said, is in the details.\n\nThis ETF, IHF, they called it.  A cage full of caged birds, each a company, a name on a ticker tape, a sliver of ownership in the vast machine.  The brochure spoke of its holdings, ten companies locked inside, their percentage of the whole laid out like sins laid bare. Sixty-three percent, it claimed, of the ETF's heart beat within those ten.\n\nBut was it a heart at all?  A beating flesh and blood thing? Or a hollow shell, a brittle cage rattling in the wind?  To find out, you had to look closer, to see beyond the glossy promise.\n\nSo I took those ten companies, those caged birds, and I set them free.  I measured their wings, their flight, their hunger.  I saw their shadows stretching long and lean against the horizon of the market.  Their returns, their risks, their stories whispered in the language of numbers.\n\nThe ETF, it promised a steady flight, a measured climb.  But the ten, they danced to a different tune.  Some soared high, some dipped low, some crashed and burned.  In their chaos, a truth began to emerge.\n\nThe ETF, it was a lie, a smoothed-over surface, a painted smile upon a cracked face.  The ten, they were the real thing, raw and wild, a reflection of the market's own untamed heart.  You could watch them, study them, understand them better than you ever could the gilded cage that claimed to contain them.\n\nThe question then was not whether the ETF was better, but whether it was necessary.  Was the cage, with its assurances and its limitations, worth the price of its confinement?  Or was freedom, even in its chaos, a better gamble?",
            "The dark land of dream, that’s what they called it. Poe dreamt it up, called it Thulé, a word that echoed back from some old man’s book, Virgil’s maybe. A place north of Britain, the edge of the world, where the Greeks kept their shadows. Poe knew these things, these forgotten words. He’d swallowed them whole, like the German poets he admired, swallowed Goethe too, whole and undigested. \n\nSome say Poe was just copying, mimicking the shadows of a greater man. This Arndt fella, he saw it, said Poe was just a pale reflection of Goethe’s King of Thulé. A king drowning in grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, a memory of his dead queen tasting bitter on his tongue. A king who walked to the edge of the world, tossed the goblet into the black water and let go.\n\nGoethe’s Faust, they said, that was the real thing. A play in two parts, the first born in 1808, the second when the old man himself breathed his last.  A king, a goblet, a death. Poe, they say, he knew the story. Heard it whispered in the wind, saw it in his own dreams. He’d even read it in that play, Faust, a few years before he wrote his own dark poem, The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nThulé, the name echoed, twice in Poe’s own work. First in The Pit, then again in Dream-Land, like a bookend to the darkness. The king in Dream-Land, he’s a ghost of the king in Thulé.  Alone, haunted by his memories, seeing the world in shades of gray. Another king, lost in his own grief. \n\nPoe, he knew Goethe. Maybe not in person, but he knew him through the words, through the echoes that resonated in his own soul.  He knew him because he knew Tennyson, who knew him too. And Poe, he knew the power of words, the way they could shape and mold a man’s soul.",
            "The applesauce lay slick on the linoleum, a slick smear of crimson against the dull tile. A stain, a testament. She came in like a whisper, a shift of shadows in the aisles, and the floor betrayed her.  He, the manager, had known. Twice he’d been told. Twice the warning had crawled into his ears, a whine barely audible over the hum of fluorescent lights and the clatter of carts. Twice he’d brushed it aside. Dinner, he’d mumbled. No time for complaints. But the smell of applesauce, cloying and sweet, had lingered, a phantom promise of trouble. Now, the silence held a different kind of weight, a heavy sigh of consequence. \n\nThe law, it whispers, speaks of malice, of a disregard for the possible harm.  Willfulness. A conscious choice to ignore the danger, like a man who dances with a loaded gun.  Six times before, they’d tripped, stumbled, fallen.  Six times the warning had been sounded. And six times, the music played on.\n\nShe, the injured one, will say he knew. He knew the floor was a trap, a waiting snare.  He knew the applesauce would become a slick, crimson ribbon, a path to pain. And he chose to look away.\n\nThey’ll talk of “despicable,” a word that hangs in the air, heavy with judgment.  They’ll dissect his actions, weigh them against the scales of justice. And he, the man who shut his eyes to the danger, will stand accused.  \n\nThe law, it is a cold, sharp blade. It cuts through the pretense, the justifications, and lays bare the truth.  And in the cold light of that truth,  he will have to answer.",
            "The dust had settled four years gone, back when the air still hummed with the echo of that first class on Islam at CBC. They argued then about the nature of the faith, whether it was a wolf in sheep's clothing or some lamb of God.  But the world's turned, spun itself on its axis since then, and the question seems sharper now, more urgent. The newsmen, they shifted their stance, once painting Islam with the same brush as those desert devils, now fawning over it, a reverence bordering on the absurd.  You wouldn't have caught a candidate with a name like Borac Obama back then, a name that whispers of a faith that was once vilified, a faith that now seems to walk hand-in-hand with the President himself.\n\nThey say the Prophet's story is one of humility, a man misunderstood, a gentle soul who drew others in with his words.  But the stories I knew, the ones etched in my memory, spoke of conquest, of swords and fire, of tribes forced to bend the knee.  They painted him a warrior, not a shepherd.  This new portrait, this biography, whispers of a different man, a man who needed no force, only truth, a man who drew men to him like moths to a flame.  \n\nAnd yet, there's a shadow of familiarity in the tales, echoes that resonate with the whispers of another story, another prophet, another miracle.  The multiplying mutton, the shared milk, a story that speaks of a power beyond man, a power that echoes across time and faith.  But it's a shadow, a pale imitation, a false dawn.  It diminishes the wonder of the true miracle, the life and death of Christ, a light that shines brighter than any borrowed flame.\n\nThese stories, these “proofs,” they twist and turn, relying on a chain of whispers, a game of telephone passed down through generations.  They lack the weight of firsthand experience, the tangibility of truth.  Instead, they offer a flimsy tapestry woven with doubt, a fragile construct that crumbles under scrutiny.\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that chills me to the bone, is the attempt to paint Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of light, a gentle soul.  But history whispers a different tale, a tale of ambition, of conquest, a tale that clashes with this romanticized vision.  And I wonder, I truly wonder, if the faithful know the true story, the story hidden beneath the layers of myth and legend, the story of the man behind the mask.",
            "The words of the man from Nazareth, they faded fast. Like dust on the wind. The faith that bloomed in his wake, it twisted.  Bent and warped by the hands of men, reaching for power, for comfort, for a God shaped in their own image. \n\nThe world spins on, restless and hungry. A thirst for change, for something new, it burns in the hearts of men. Old ways crumble, cast aside like worn-out clothes. But those who cling to the shadows, they fear the light. They clutch their scriptures tight, afraid to see what lies beyond.\n\nYet a whisper stirs. A yearning for truth. A hunger for the primal word, untainted by the accretions of time. It will grow, this yearning, a tide rising against the shore.  Decades will pass, centuries may fall, but the tide will rise.  The clock will turn back, its hands unwinding the knots of dogma, unraveling the layers of man-made belief.  What remains will be the bare bones of the man from Nazareth's message, stripped and stark.\n\nAnd when this tide reaches the shores of the known world, a new dawn will break. Churches, those monuments to man's striving, will stand tall, but within their walls, the echoes will change. The multitude will gather, not to hear the pronouncements of men, but to listen to the whispers of the heart.  \n\nDiversity will give way to unity, not of doctrine, but of spirit.  The divisions that scar the landscape of faith will fade, leaving a canvas washed clean.  History itself will bend, its arc tracing a path back to the source. A reversion, yes, but not a simple turning back. It will be a rebirth, a return to the wellspring, a rediscovering of the man and his message, stripped bare, raw and true.\n\nLook to the past, for in its shadows, the future hides.  Remember the rise of the eagle, the fall of empires, the slow crawl of progress.  History is a river, ever flowing, ever changing.  And in its depths, the seeds of the future lie waiting. \n\nJudaism, the cradle of faith, stands silent witness. Monotheism, the yearning for a single truth, echoes in the wind. The Hebrew scriptures, a beacon in the darkness, guide the way. There, in the heart of those ancient words, the seed of the man from Nazareth took root.",
            "The smoke rose from the factories, a black river against the sky. The buildings, stark and unforgiving, pressed in on the huddled workers,  their lives as expendable as the meat that passed through their hands. Greed, it seemed, was the only law in this place. The owners, fat and bloated on the spoils of their industry, cared nothing for the men and women who fueled their fortunes. They saw them as cogs in a machine, their labor a necessary evil, their suffering an acceptable cost. \n\nSinclair’s words, sharp as a butcher’s blade, cut through the veil of complacency: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This was no mere industry; it was a den of vipers, a place where humanity was devoured by the insatiable maw of profit.\n\nThe air itself was thick with rot, the stench of blood and decay mingling with the acrid tang of coal smoke. A man's life was measured in hours, in the relentless march of the clock, his body broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of endless labor.  \n\n\"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  These were not men; they were ghosts, their faces hollowed by hunger and fatigue, their eyes dulled by the endless grind. The owners, cloaked in their wealth, saw them as nothing more than meat, expendable and replaceable.\n\nThe Jungle was a labyrinth of despair, its walls closing in on its inhabitants, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. There were whispers of unions, flickering flames of hope struggling against the wind, but they were often corrupted, their promises as hollow as the factories themselves.  The workers, their backs bent under the yoke of oppression, had become slaves to a system that offered no escape, no redemption.\n\nSinclair's words echoed the horror, the overwhelming sense of helplessness: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The way a man shapes a story, the feeling he wants it to hold, that’s a thing of power. Some ways are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In his *Gatsby*, he paints with words, not just with brushstrokes, but with the colors themselves. Gold, green, white, red, each one a whisper, a secret understood only by the heart. He builds meaning, layer upon layer, till the colors sing.\n\nHe uses white and gray like a shroud, a blanket of uniformity. White, the clean, the bright, the promise of something better. Gray, the faded, the worn, the forgotten.  He drapes this white and gray over Daisy and Jordan, always in white, a ghostly procession. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, even Catherine powdered milky white.  It's as if the world itself is trying to smother itself in this sterile light.  And then there are the names, lost in the gray, souls swallowed by the city.\n\nHe paints the streets in shades of white and gray:  the \"white chasms\" of the city, the \"gray cars,\" the \"gray land.\"  And the people, they are shades too.  Jordan and Daisy, their girlhood a \"white\" thing. The Italian child, gray. The dog seller, a \"gray old man.\"\n\nThen, Fitzgerald takes this weight of white and gray and lays it upon Daisy. He wraps her in it, until she becomes a symbol, a desire, a phantom.  The \"white roadster,\" the \"white girlhood,\" a \"gray haze\" of fur.  She's not a woman, not anymore. She's an idea, an echo of something lost.",
            "The dust hung low over the valley, a shroud of bone-white in the dying light.  San Diego County, they called it. Once a land of plenty, choked now with the bones of what had been. Tomatoes, citrus, greens - ghosts of bounty, whispers in the wind. The land remembered, though. The sun still kissed it, a pale, indifferent fire. \n\nFolks here, they spoke of a different kind of plenty - organic, they called it. A word that meant something different now. A way to coax life from the ash, to feed the ghosts. A market for it, they said, a hungry maw for the pure and the simple. Eggs, milk, honey - all carried on the backs of weary hands and the dreams of men who still believed in the soil.\n\nThere was a farm, a teardrop of green in the vastness, nestled near the town of Potrero. An old homestead, they said, where shadows danced in the chaparral and the wind carried the ghosts of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. A hundred species, they said, lived there, or at least the remnants of them. A kangaroo rat, a frog, butterflies, a small, gray bird with a song like a sigh. All clinging to life, to the memory of what had been.\n\nThis land, it held memories. A hundred years, maybe more, etched in the dust and the gnarled roots of the oak trees. A place where the wild still whispered, where the echoes of ancient stories lingered. But the whisper was fading, the stories becoming lost. \n\nThe man who dreamt of this farm, he looked at the land with tired eyes. He saw the emptiness, the ghosts of abundance, the fragile life clinging to the edge. He saw a chance, a flicker of hope in the dying light.

Words like stones tossed carelessly, skipping across the surface of a deep well.  A man's heart held more secrets than any book. To understand him, you had to look beyond the broad strokes, the clichés painted on a canvas too wide to hold the truth. \n\nWhen you crossed into a new land, you saw it through the lens of your own storms, your own sunrises. But the echoes in those eyes, the way they held the weight of a thousand unspoken histories, those belonged to them, not to you. You could learn, though. You could learn the language of their silence, the rhythm of their laughter. You could learn to read the lines on their faces, the stories etched there by the winds of their lives.\n\nAnd in the heart of a negotiation, where the stakes were high and the air thick with unspoken promises, understanding was the only currency that mattered. A man who knew the song of another's soul, who understood the weight of their history, he was a man who could make a deal. He could bridge the chasms of difference, find common ground in the desolate landscape of mistrust.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This echo of Psalm 14 bleeds into the marrow of St. Anselm's bones, his argument a prayer whispered against the encroaching dark. It’s a dark that Thomas Aquinas, too, would find himself wrestling with, each man reaching for the same light, the same God of the Bible, a God whose shape is already etched in their minds. \n\nBut the question burns: Is either man truly illuminating the path, or are they merely tracing shadows? To answer, we must assume, for the sake of this reckoning, that they both see the same God, the God of scripture, the God who breathes life into the dusty pages.  \n\nAnselm’s path is inward, a pilgrimage through the caverns of the soul. He believes God resides within the mind, a truth so self-evident that to doubt him is to deny the very essence of thought itself.  He speaks of faith as a light flickering in the dark, a conviction born not of proof but of the soul’s own knowing. The burden of proof, he suggests, lies not in the external world but in the silence of the heart.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different road. He seeks God’s fingerprint in the world, in the rustling leaves, the turning tide, the very fabric of existence. His five proofs are stones laid in the path, each one a testament to the divine logic that underpins the universe. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony – these are the whispers of God’s hand, the echoes of his presence in the world of sense.  He offers not faith but reason, a map drawn in the language of logic, a blueprint for understanding God through the very world God created.\n\nBut do these paths truly lead to the same destination? Does Anselm’s inward journey illuminate the same God as Aquinas’s outward gaze? Or do they merely offer two different perspectives on the same mystery?  The answer, perhaps, lies not in the certainty of their arguments but in the enduring question they both leave us with: Is there a God who exists beyond the reach of our senses, beyond the grasp of our logic, a God who whispers his truth in the silence of the soul, and who writes his story in the grand tapestry of the universe?",
            "The dust of time had settled on the man's story, obscuring the clarity of his beginnings. Born a prince, they said, he'd walked away from it all.  The world had held him in its sway, but he'd found escape in the silence of his own making. They called him Buddha, a name whispered in the hush of temples and chanted in the wind. He'd gathered his teachings, spun them into threads of wisdom, and woven them into a tapestry known as Dhamma. And from that cloth, a faith was born – Theravada, the ancient way. \n\nBut time, like a river, flows ever onward. The world shifted, the sun rose and set upon a thousand seasons, and the shape of faith changed too. In Sri Lanka, where the echoes of his words still lingered, they held to the water-cutting ceremony. A custom not born of his own lips, yet embraced nonetheless. A shadow of change, flickering in the margins of the ancient light.\n\nThis was not a simple matter of faded robes and altered rituals. It was a deeper thing, a subtle turning within the soul of the faith. The monks, cloaked in saffron, and the laity, their lives interwoven with the fabric of the world, both felt the shift. The doctrines, once stark and clear, began to bend in the wind, their edges softened by the passage of time.\n\nTo understand this, one must first grasp the forces that shaped it. The internal forces, those born from within the community itself, monks and laymen alike. And the external, the voices from beyond the walls of the temple, a chorus of voices, some friendly, some hostile, all seeking to leave their mark.\n\nAt the heart of it all lay the core belief – refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast ocean of wisdom contained in the Tripitaka – the three baskets of scripture. The Suttas, the Vinaya, the Abhidhamma. These texts spoke of impermanence, of suffering, of the endless cycle of rebirth. They spoke of the emptiness of the self, the fire of desire, and the path to liberation. \n\nBut even the most sacred teachings are not immune to change. The world outside, with its shifting sands and restless tides, inevitably found its way in. And within, the human heart, ever yearning and ever changing, sought its own expression. The water-cutting ceremony, a silent testament to this, flowed on, a ripple in the vastness of time.",
            "The border between them, a scar across the land, had bled for fifty-seven years. From 1836 till 1893, the United States and Mexico danced a bloody waltz, a tango of distrust and hate.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high note, the crescendo of this discord, came with the war of 1846. The Americans, hungry and grasping, swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving Mexico drained and broken.   \n\nBut the skirmishes, the whispers of war, had been there long before.  They weren't born from a single cause, but from a tangled web of differences. Religion, culture, the very soul of each nation, clashed against the other. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).  Like a hunter stalking its prey, this blood feud echoed in other borders, in other lands where nations, neighbors, turned on one another. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher, in his study of these tangled affairs, said it plainly: “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Geography, a constant reminder of their proximity, a knife twisting in the wound. \n\nThe weight of religion, a heavy cross, pressed down on their relationship.  Sally Frahm, in her examination of this history, wrote, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). Like the Cold War, another struggle born of ideology, but in this case, it was not communism or capital, but God and faith that stood in the way. The ghosts of the Spanish and English, their old quarrels echoing across generations, poisoned the well of goodwill.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed seventeen disputes, seventeen wounds, in those fifty-seven years. Most were over land, over the shifting sands of borders, over the audacity of bandits who crossed from one side to the other. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The violence, a feral thing, seemed to seep from the land itself. \n\nSchmitt (1974) points out that as Mexico grew dependent on the United States, the animosity waned. The hunger for land was replaced by a hunger for something else, something more insidious: control. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",

No matter how you prep, some storms you can't weather alone.\n\nThese days, folks talk about independence, about buildin' your own damn shelter. But that ain't what saved this country.

            "The way things grow, the way they change... it's a mystery. Even the old books, they barely scratch the surface. Like a man trying to map the dark with a candle's flicker.  D'Arcy Thompson, he said it back in '17, that we ain't even begun to speak the language of life, to capture it in numbers. But maybe now, with these new tools, these equations, we can start to pry open the secrets. We're looking at a kind of shell, a spiral, a Prunum.  It builds itself, layer by layer, over time. And we're trying to see how it does it, what forces pull it this way, what boundaries hold it back. We take pictures, X-rays, to see the bones inside, the structure. Then we feed those pictures into a machine, a  thing called CerioShell. It can build shells, not real ones, but  shadows, possibilities.  \n\nIt's like looking at a river carving its way through stone. You can see the ripples, the bends, the way the water wears away the rock. And maybe, just maybe, by studying those ripples, by understanding the water's path, we can understand how the canyon was made.  \n\nWe're trying to do the same thing with these shells, to understand the forces that shaped them, the forces that shaped life itself.",
            "The dust of mortality hung heavy over Indonesia. The children, the frailest reeds in the field of life, withered still, their numbers clinging to the same grim tally for a decade. Though the land had made strides on some paths – water, sanitation, a semblance of progress – the road to healthy mothers and children remained choked with thorns. They aimed for a finish line in 2015, a phantom date in a fog of want. But the truth, etched in the quiet despair of a mother's eyes, was that the race was far from won. \n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, a figure that shimmered on the page, 72% now. But those numbers were hollow. Did they include the women who knew the ways of the world but not the ways of medicine? Did they count the midwives, who could soothe a birth but not staunch a hemorrhage?  Even the numbers whispered of a deeper truth: the mothers, the blood-soaked vessels of life, were left to bleed in the shadows. \n\nDiarrhea, the scourge of the young, stalked the land, but even when it gripped a child, the reach of a doctor's hand was often too short. Postnatal care, a fragile promise whispered to new mothers, was a threadbare blanket in a cold world.\n\nCesarean sections, a last resort, a lifeline in a storm, were scarce. 4%. A whisper of a chance in a land where life hung by a thread.  The city, a beacon of hope, boasted 7%, while the countryside, a shadowed valley, offered only 2%. The chasm between them was a canyon of despair, a testament to the uneven hand of progress.\n\nAnd then there was the question of equity, the unspoken ache in the heart of the nation.  The poorest, those who could least afford it, were locked out of the sanctuaries of healing. A 27% gap. A chasm of opportunity, of life.\n\nSo they stood at a crossroads. Should they build more roads, more clinics, more programs? Or should they build a stronger foundation, a system that could withstand the storms of poverty and neglect? \n\nThe allure of quick fixes, of targeted solutions, was strong. But history whispered a warning.  Programs, like children, could grow too tall, too quickly, and topple.  Resources, like water, could be diverted to the highest bidder, leaving the parched land to wither.\n\nThe answer, the old men said, lay not in a single solution but in a web of care, woven strong and deep. A system that nurtured not just bodies but spirits, that reached into the shadows and pulled forth the forgotten, the abandoned. A system that held up a mirror to the nation and dared it to see itself, not as it was, but as it could be.",
            "The world of Victorian novels is a place of meticulous detail, a world where the aristocracy reigns supreme. Yet, within this tapestry of societal norms, two tales emerge, defying the rigid conventions of their time: <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Both novels weave through the darkness, venturing into the labyrinth of mystery and the realm of the bizarre, offering a glimpse into the tormented souls that inhabit them. This unsettling departure from the expected strengthens the narrative, illuminating the characters' motivations and exposing the depths of their emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from <i>Oliver Twist</i>: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese dreamlike visions, recurring throughout the novel, offer a glimpse into the recesses of Oliver's tormented soul. They reveal his pain, his confusion, and his growing awareness of the harsh reality that surrounds him.  The shooting, when revisited in chapter 28, unfolds as a vivid hallucination, mirroring Oliver's desperate struggle for survival. The passage emphasizes the overwhelming sense of powerlessness that consumes him. His senses are numbed as he is carried away by an unseen force, unable to control his fate. The pain, constant and relentless, becomes a chilling reminder of his vulnerability. \n\nOliver's helplessness begs the question: who is truly in control of his destiny? Is it his own, or is he merely a pawn in the hands of fate, manipulated by the cruel machinations of others, particularly the menacing figure of Fagin? This brutal reality shatters any illusions of agency, leaving Oliver adrift in a sea of despair.\n\n\nIn Emily Brontë's *Wuthering Heights*, the use of mystery and the macabre takes on a different form, often manifesting as haunting premonitions and spectral presences. \n\n\nThe pervasive darkness of the Yorkshire moors, the wild passions of the characters, and the lingering shadows of the past all contribute to a sense of unease that permeates the narrative. This haunting atmosphere serves to amplify the characters' internal struggles, blurring the lines between reality and madness. \n\n\nLike Oliver Twist, *Wuthering Heights* confronts themes of social injustice and the destructive consequences of unchecked desire. However, the novel's exploration of these themes is more complex and multifaceted, delving into the darker recesses of the human psyche.",
            "The dust of the after school settled as I watched him, Adrian. Maybe third, maybe fourth grade, lost in a world of letters that didn't seem to make sense. He'd pronounce some right, others like a stranger speaking a foreign tongue. It was a puzzle, because the boy spoke English clear as day.  His skin, the color of sun-baked clay, held the stories of a heritage not his own, a language humming just beneath the surface. I knew then, as clear as the desert sky, that the problem wasn't in his knowing, but in the knowing he lacked.\n\nHis mother came then, a woman of shadows and whispers, her words a storm of wind I couldn't grasp. My Spanish, a meager shield against a torrent, barely held. But in the broken fragments, the truth surfaced. He read, he just didn't know the alphabet. The English one. The ghost of a smile crossed my face, a beacon in the fog.\n\nAdrian, he was fine. He just needed a map, a guide to navigate the strange terrain of letters. A simple thing, really. But for the countless others, the children swallowed by the vastness of a language not their own, the path is long and winding. There's no single key, no magic spell to unlock the door. It takes a chorus of voices, a symphony of approaches.\n\nWe need the dual language system, a bridge between worlds. Not just for the Spanish speakers, but for every child, a tapestry woven with threads of understanding. We need tutors, guides, beacons in the linguistic darkness. We need immersion, a baptism in the language of opportunity.\n\nThe fear, the whispers of wasted resources, they are the ghosts of indifference.  The answer lies not in isolation, but in communion, in the shared language of learning. The future, the children, they are the hostages of this silence. Let us be their translators, their guides, their voices in the wilderness.",
            "The rain fell hard on the tin roof, a steady drumbeat against the silence that had settled in. It was the kind of rain that washed away the world, leaving only the grey sky and the slick, dark wood of the porch. We sat there, my father and I, two shadows against the flickering light of the porch lamp. He held a cigarette between his fingers, the ember a red eye in the gloom, and stared out at the world dissolving in the storm.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice hoarse, as if unused. His eyes, though, were on something else, some place beyond the rain, beyond the porch, beyond the world I knew.  A place I couldn't see. \n\nHe had grown thin, his clothes hanging loose on his frame like rags on a skeleton. The hair that was once thick and dark was now sparse, a thin dusting across his scalp. He looked old, ancient, his face etched with the lines of a life lived hard.\n\nHe didn't look at me, didn't meet my eyes. He just kept staring out at the rain, his gaze fixed on something unseen. I wanted to ask him about it, about the place his eyes were focused on, but the words wouldn't come. The silence was heavy, thick with unspoken things, with the fear that coiled tight in my gut.  I knew he was fading, slipping away, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nInstead, I leaned closer, drew in a breath of the damp air, and let the silence wash over us.  We sat there together, two souls adrift in the storm, each searching for a light in the dark.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel, in its very name, is a contradiction: \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt aptly describes it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*.  It's been dismissed, lauded, accused of shallowness, and hailed for its \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the genre, wove together threads from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new literary path. He blended \"old\" theatrical flourishes with the \"new\" realism of the novel, crafting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).  The Gothic, it seems, always walks a tightrope between the echoes of medieval gothic theater, architecture, and lore, and the burgeoning anxieties of the modern age. Even in Walpole's time, \"Gothic\" carried baggage - archaic, unsophisticated, a relic of bygone eras pitted against the perceived progress of the modern world.\n\nThis collision of the theatrical Gothic and the intimate, psychological scope of the novel is what has granted it such enduring power, making it both timeless and strangely alien to the reader separated by centuries.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval code of knighthood, its rituals and ideals, is both evoked and twisted in *The Castle of Otranto*.  Chivalry becomes a touchstone for Gothic writers precisely because of what it represented: the ideal knight, brave, honorable, competent - a stark contrast to the perceived failings of contemporary society.  Through chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" is idealized, romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism.  It's a yearning for a lost moral compass, a way to mend the perceived flaws of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have been grappling with a sense of societal decay.  He may have seen in the idealized \"goodness\" of the past a reflection of a world lost. This is reflected in characters like Frederic. Even before we meet him, we're told he embodies chivalric virtues:\n\n[Walpole's description of Frederic here, focusing on his noble lineage, tragic past, and assumed chivalric qualities]\n\nThe description is laced with chivalric imagery, reinforcing Frederic's status as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that, exaggerated to Gothic extremes, foreshadows the excess that characterizes the genre (66).",
            "The road to a thing, it ain't a straight line.  It twists and turns, like the path of some lost soul. It starts with a whisper, a need in the belly of the customer, a want for something unseen. Then it bleeds into the raw, the bones of the earth, the dust and grit of the materials.  It rumbles through factories, a churning heart of production, where men and machines toil in a rhythmic dance of creation.  Each part a cog in a vast machine, each link in a chain stretching back to the very source. They call it supply chain, this intricate web of movement and exchange. The man who first spoke the name, Oliver, he saw it as a river, flowing from the customer's hand, to the outstretched hand of the provider.\n\nSix pillars hold it up: production, the beating heart; supply, the steady pulse; inventory, the gathered hoard; location, the chosen ground; transportation, the restless wings; and information, the whispering wind that guides it all.  \n\nProduction, that's where the story begins.  It's the forge, the anvil where the raw material is shaped into something new. Managers, they are the architects, the smiths who plan and build, guided by the whispers of the market. They sniff the air, they feel the pulse of the people, they know what is wanted before it's even spoken. They decide what to build, how much, and where, each choice echoing through the chain. \n\nThen comes the supply, the gathering of the pieces, the building of the network.  A symphony of partnerships, each player with their own role, their own expertise. Some stay close, others are scattered far and wide.  It's a delicate balance, this dance of near and far, of closeness and distance.  Managers, they are the conductors, guiding the flow, keeping the rhythm steady.\n\nAnd so it goes, each link in the chain, each step in the journey, a testament to the human desire to build, to connect, to create.  It's a cold, hard world out there, but these chains, they bind us, they give us purpose, they remind us that we are not alone in the darkness.",

Ellen Page, face pale beneath the harsh fluorescent glare of the streetlight, stood alone, a solitary figure against the backdrop of indifferent city sprawl. Burma, they called it now, but the old name, Myanmar, still clung to the tongue like a forgotten ghost. A place shrouded in a perpetual dusk, ruled by men who wore the shadows like a shroud.\n\nThey came to power in a whisper, a coup that stole the dawn, a junta that bled the country dry. In '07, a flicker of defiance ignited. Monks, clad in saffron robes, their faces etched with the weight of a thousand years of suffering, took to the streets. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a wave of orange and gold crashing against the iron fist of the regime.\n\nThe wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of ash and decay.  A dead city, choked by dust and silence. The monks, their prayers echoing in empty streets, were met with a hail of bullets. The world looked away. Journalists, their notebooks filled with whispered horrors, were snatched from the shadows, their voices silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking truth, paid the ultimate price, his camera a silent witness to the carnage.\n\nBut the whispers persist. \"Thirteen dead,\" they say, the official lie.  Colonel Hla Win, a ghost from a broken army, spoke of thousands, their bodies lost in the dust and the dark. A darkness that stains the soul of those who harbor it.\n\nRome, its emperors draped in the robes of divinity, crushed dissent beneath their gilded sandals. Japan, its emperors worshipped as gods, wielded power with the cold precision of a samurai blade. And here, in this land, a president with a name whispered in hushed tones, consults with a pastor whose pronouncements scent of brimstone and fear.\n\nTiananmen Square, its echoes stained with the blood of innocents. A sea of humanity, yearning for freedom, drowned in a tide of steel and fire.  Rwanda, where the blood of brothers and sisters flowed like a river, turning a nation crimson. And Hitler's shadow, a specter that haunts the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents, but chapters in a grim and enduring story. The story of power, of greed, of the unending struggle for control. A story that plays out on a stage of broken promises and shattered dreams. A story that, if we are not vigilant, will continue to unfold, generation after generation, until the world itself is consumed by the darkness.",

Like the rhythm of a heart, steady and sure, a testament to the enduring spirit of man. \n\nHe remembered hearing it once, years ago, a distant echo in a forgotten time. The music had seeped into him, a balm for a soul weary from the road. The melody, it whispered of lost loves and forgotten dreams, of cities bathed in moonlight and streets choked by dust.

It was a sound that transcended time and place, a universal language that spoke to the depths of his being.\n\nHe knew, in that moment, that the music would endure.

            "The hunger gnawed at her, a constant ache in the hollow of her chest. It wasn't hunger for food or drink, but for something else, something she couldn't name. It had begun when she was a girl, barely thirteen, a whisper in the back of her mind that grew louder with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, it roared like a desert wind, a yearning for something she couldn't grasp. \n\nShe'd tried to pin it down, this elusive want. Boys had come and gone, drawn to her like moths to a flame, but none ignited the spark within her. Their clumsy attempts at courtship fell flat, leaving her with a sense of detachment, of being an island in a sea of indifference. What was wrong with her? How could she be so untouched at this age? The question haunted her, a dull ache in the corners of her mind.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a symphony of normalcy played out in the hushed tones of her parents' voices. They were good people, her parents, their lives woven together in a tapestry of quiet contentment. Arguments were as rare as rainstorms in the desert, and even when they occurred, they faded quickly, leaving no trace. Yet, she, their daughter, was a storm in their calm sea. Her laughter rang out, her energy a vibrant counterpoint to their measured lives. They loved her fiercely, bewildered by her tempestuous spirit.\n\nBut today, the quiet was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice strained with pain, sliced through the stillness. Fear, cold and sharp, pricked at her. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow...sweetheart, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words broken and ragged.  \n\nHer daughter's heart hammered against her ribs. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, her voice a thin thread. Relief washed over her. At least she knew what to do. She carried her mother, a weight heavier than she'd ever imagined, to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, the scent of disinfectant and sterile fear clinging to the air. She barely registered the worried faces that gathered around her mother. All she could think about was getting her mother help.\n\nLater, the doctor explained that her mother had fallen from a stepladder, reaching for a vase on a high shelf. It wasn't serious, but serious enough to warrant a visit to the hospital. \n\nShe sat beside her mother's bed, relief washing over her in waves. The hunger, for a moment, seemed to recede, replaced by a deep, abiding love. Maybe, she thought, this was the thing she'd been searching for all along.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the weathered faces of the women, their eyes the color of a long-forgotten sea. They spoke of a way of living, a diet of sun-baked earth and the bounty of the sea. The \"Mediterranean,\" they called it, a way of life woven into the fabric of their being. They spoke of olive oil shimmering like liquid gold, of fish pulled from the depths, of fruits bursting with the sweetness of the sun. They spoke of grains, the lifeblood of their sustenance, and beans, the humble earth's offering. \n\nThese women, gathered under a sky bleached white by time, carried knowledge passed down through generations. They believed that this way of eating, this \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" as they called it, held the promise of a longer life, a life free from the grip of the heart's burden. Theirs was a way of life that whispered of resilience, a resistance against the slow decay, the creeping shadows of illness. They watched as the sun dipped below the horizon, staining the sky the color of blood, and they knew.

A truth whispered on the wind, a truth etched in their very being. The \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" they found, was a promise whispered on the wind, a beacon in the darkness. It was a way of life that offered hope, a chance to defy the encroaching shadows.",
            "The year was two thousand seven. The country, it broke. Like an old bone, cracked clean through. The air was choked with ash, the dust of broken dreams and shattered promises.  Men lost their jobs, their houses, their grip on the world. Corporations, once giants, toppled like rotten trees in a storm. A sickness had spread through the veins of the nation, a fever of greed and reckless faith.  \n\nThey say it began in the halls of power, with men in suits and ties, whispering deals in hushed tones. Men who played with money like it was sand, ignoring the warnings, the tremors in the earth. They loosened the reins, let the wolves loose, and the wolves devoured the sheep.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were the shepherds, or pretended to be. They gathered up the frail mortgages, the bad debts, and stitched them into bundles, wove them into securities, traded them like weapons.  They called them CDOs, CDSs - fancy names for poisoned fruit.\n\nThe borrowers, they were the ones who paid the price. Many of them, good folk, honest folk, were lured in by promises of easy money. They signed on the dotted line, unaware of the trap, unaware of the storm brewing on the horizon.  They thought they were building a future, but they were building their own coffin.\n\nThe day came when the music stopped. The houses that were once castles crumbled, and the wolves, they turned on each other, their fangs bared in a frenzy of fear and desperation.\n\nWall Street, the heart of the beast, bled. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch - giants fallen. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, they limped away, scarred and broken. Fannie and Freddie, their bones picked clean, were left in the dust. \n\nThe nation, it staggered, bruised and bleeding. The air was thick with the smell of ash and regret.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a shroud over the remnants of a world long gone.  It clung to the back of his throat like a bad memory.  He knew he should tell her, lay it all out: the meeting at the diner, greasy spoon with chipped Formica, him slumped over a lukewarm coffee, her sunlight smile cutting through the gloom.  The way she'd laughed at his joke, the one about the air force and the gas station, a joke born of bitterness and resignation.  The marriage, a quick affair in a courthouse, no fanfare, just two souls seeking warmth in the cold, empty spaces of their lives.\n\nBut the words wouldn't come.  They'd choke him, tangle in his throat like the barbed wire at the edge of the road.  Better to let her see, to feel the weight of his past in the way his hand unconsciously tightened around the pistol grip, in the shadow that lingered in his eyes, a ghost of a life lost.  He'd show her through the silences, the unspoken truths etched in the lines of his face, the weariness in his gait.  Let her piece together the fragments of his story, the echoes of laughter and love, the sting of loss and regret, just as he'd pieced together hers.\n\nThey'd find their own rhythm, their own way of breathing in this world stripped bare, where the wind carried the scent of ashes and the ghosts of a thousand dreams.",
            "The news from Columbus bled slow and gray across the screen. Two broadcasts this morning, both swallowed by the day like dust devils in the heat. The first, NBC 4, a flickering image of a man named Shad Hostettler. His eyes, two black pits in a skull of bone, stared out from a mugshot. Ashley, Ohio. A wife stabbed. A story barely whispered, two minutes sold to the hungry maw of the midday hours. \n\nThe second, a young man named Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot down in the Sharon Woods. No suspects, no answers, just the hollow echo of a SWAT team's boots on pavement. A black boy, a name forgotten, a life snuffed out. The news moved on, the world uncaring.\n\nA shot in the Med-Flight, a .22 whisper against steel, a five thousand dollar promise for a whisper back. UDF robbed, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie. A body type, an accent, a color.  A story told in shades of fear. Rene Rodriguez, a Texas kingpin, 300 months to pay for his sins. Hispanic, they said. The words hung heavy in the air.\n\nThe rain was coming, a curtain of water promised for Saturday. The weatherman, a voice like a tired sigh, spoke of heat and humidity. A teaser for a storm, a mere breath before the deluge.",
            "The blood ties bind, they hold fast. A brother to his brother. A knot woven tight with threads of love and anger, envy and pain.  They see themselves reflected in each other’s eyes, the good and the bad, the light and the dark. It’s in the face of ruin that this bond reveals its true nature. A stark truth laid bare. A cost to be paid. \n\nUnderstanding this bond, this tangle of emotions, means understanding the price. To look into a brother’s eyes and see not what they want you to see, but the raw truth, the soul laid open. That’s where the reckoning lies. What they do, what they are. \n\nIn “The Scarlet Ibis”, two boys, bound by blood and circumstance, test this truth. Against a backdrop of a world both beautiful and brutal, they embark on a journey that ends in tragedy. Pride, bitter and sharp, clashes with a love that can’t quite grasp its own strength. Only one survives the storm.\n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, his heart a tangled knot of feelings. It’s his pride, his need to be seen as strong, that drives him. He wants a brother to share his adventures, to run and climb and race with.  But Doodle, his younger brother, is frail, a whisper of a boy against the backdrop of a world that demands strength.  Doodle is a weight, a burden, a constant reminder of the brother he never wanted. The narrator's thoughts, his memories, paint a picture of a boy struggling to reconcile his love for his brother with the resentment he feels. The world he sees, the way he reacts to it, all are shaped by this conflict.\n\t\nHe yearns to teach Doodle, to prove his own worth. He wants to drag him into the world he knows, but Doodle is a fragile thing.  The narrator's memories, his very words, reveal a darkness within him, a fleeting thought of ending Doodle’s life before it truly begins. But then Doodle smiles, and the darkness recedes. The love, the instinctive bond, lingers.",
            "The skull, a cold and empty thing. Inside, a storm of phantoms.  They called it the brain, this engine of thought, this labyrinth of fire and wire.  It had once been likened to a wax tablet, a parchment scroll, a book bound in bone.  Now, they spoke of it as a machine, a cold calculating thing of gears and circuits. But the brain, it knows no such things. It weaves its own tapestry, a dark and intricate web spun from sensation and memory.  It takes the raw materials of the world – the touch of wind, the sting of rain, the taste of ash – and shapes them into its own desolate landscape.\n\nThe senses, they are the gateways.  They flood the mind with a torrent of data, a cacophony of light and sound and scent. The brain, it sifts through the noise, a scavenger picking through the ruins. It builds its own maps, its own narratives. A shadow flickers across the wall, a whisper in the dark. The brain, it seizes on these fragments, weaving them into a story, a phantom of meaning.\n\nThe attention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it fades.  It chooses what to see, what to hear, what to remember. The world is a flood of stimuli, but the mind, it can only hold a drop or two. A name, a face, a touch. The rest, it slips away, lost in the shadows.\n\nAnd then, the memory.  A fragile thing, a wisp of smoke in the wind. It clings to the brain, clinging to the edges of consciousness.  It can be recalled, a glimpse into the past, a phantom of what was. But time, it is a relentless tide. It washes away the memories, leaving only fragments, echoes of a forgotten dream.\n\nThey say the brain is a machine. A tool. But it is more than that. It is a prison, a sanctuary, a battlefield. It is the seat of our hopes and fears, our dreams and nightmares. It is the engine of our humanity, a fire burning in the darkness.",
            "The glass world shimmered, a cold, bright carapace over the ashes of what had been. Huxley saw it coming, the creeping tendrils of technology and the iron fist of capitalism strangling the soul of man. In his Brave New World, happiness was a drug, a chemical concoction dispensed by the World Controller, a puppeteer pulling the strings of a million minds. Community, conformity, and the relentless churn of consumption – these were the pillars of a society built on illusion. \n\nMarx's specter haunted Huxley's pages. Homogeny, reification, the tools of a system designed to grind individuals into indistinguishable cogs.  The proletariat, those trapped in the gears of the machine, were kept blind to their true condition. Hypnopædia, the insidious art of programming dreams, instilled in them the desire for fleeting pleasures, the insatiable hunger for more. The World Controller, a god in a chrome and glass temple, whispered his desires into their waking moments, shaping their thoughts, their wants, their very identities.\n\nHuxley's critique was a scalpel, dissecting the lie of false consciousness. The masses, shackled by their own contentment, were unaware of the architect of their gilded cage. Hegemony, the invisible hand that steered them, was the weapon of the ruling class, a subtle manipulation that ensured their continued dominance. The Alphas and Betas, the architects of this manufactured happiness, were complicit in the system, their own desires muted by the comforts of their position. The lower castes, the Deltas and Gammas, were mere puppets, dancing to the tune of a master they could not see.\n\nLove, individuality, spontaneity – these were relics of a bygone age, discarded in the pursuit of order and efficiency.  The characters, mere shadows in a sterile landscape, were devoid of depth, their interactions shallow and transactional. Huxley painted a picture of a world where human connection had been replaced by a cold, calculated efficiency. He warned us of a future where technology, unchecked by conscience, would erode the very essence of what it meant to be human.",
            "The asphalt stretched before him, cracked and gray, a serpent winding through the skeletal trees. Four and a half semesters. That's how long he'd been a prisoner in this concrete valley they called University Park. East Halls, they called it. A cage at the edge of things, a purgatory of endless walks. Willard, a distant god in the heart of the campus, a pilgrimage in the teeth of the wind. He'd heard tales, whispers from those who'd come before, of when the land stretched empty, a wilderness of forgotten dreams. Now, it was choked with brick and concrete, a monument to progress, a labyrinth of its own making.\n\nHe'd spoken to a ghost, an alum, a shade from a forgotten era, and the man had spoken of a simpler time. When the bike was king, a whisper in the wind, a passage across the barren plains. Now, the bike was a relic, a forgotten weapon in the war for space.\n\nBut the man's words echoed still, a ghost in his own mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, eyes clouded with the memory of a lost freedom. \"It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nHe knew it was true. He'd felt the power of the wheels beneath him, the wind whipping past, the freedom in his own two legs. \n\nHe lived now beyond the edges of the campus, a nomad in a land of stones and steel, a shadow in the fading light. A bike, he thought, that's what he needed. A way to reclaim his stolen time, to escape the endless march of asphalt and brick. Pollock Road beckoned, a ribbon of black leading to the heart of the warren. A challenge, a test of will.\n\nHe could walk. He could fight his way through the throngs of humanity, the endless tide of bodies. But he wanted more. He wanted to fly.\n\nHe'd heard the whispers, the legends of the bike, the whispers of a time when the campus was a place of wind and trees, not concrete and steel. He yearned for that time, for that freedom."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The road stretched on, gray and ashen, the dust kicked up by a wind that carried the silence of the grave. It was a road that led nowhere, but it was the only road I knew. The city, a burnt husk, was a phantom memory, a ghost town in the wasteland. I had seen too much of that kind of emptiness, too much of the hollow stares of the abandoned.  \n\nThis road, it led to a different kind of emptiness, the kind that settled deep in your bones, the kind that gnawed at the heart. The kind that only a child's eyes could pierce. Those eyes, wide and innocent, looking for a flicker of hope, a spark of light in the growing darkness.\n\nThey say there’s a fire in every heart. But mine, it felt like a dying ember, threatened by the ever-present chill. I could still remember the heat of another fire, though, a fire of rage that burned in my gut that day I stood on the porch, watching the boy sit on the edge of the couch, his face pale and drawn. His words, whispered through choked sobs, echoed in my ears: \"They're hurting me.\" \n\nThat's when I decided to fight. Not with fists or guns, but with the only weapon I had left: my will. I would be his shield, his protector. I would be the voice for those who had no voice.\n\nThe road stretched on, and the wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. But somewhere, deep inside, the ember flickered. It was a small flame, but it was enough. Enough to keep me going, enough to keep me fighting for the boy, for the hope that maybe, just maybe, we could find a place where the sun still shone.",
            "The dust of affliction. That's what insomnia is, a slow, creeping dust that settles in the bones, the mind, the very marrow of a man. Some say it's in the blood, a curse woven into the fibers of your being. A legacy inherited from some long-dead ancestor who knew the cold grip of sleepless nights. Others say it's the world that's to blame, the weight of it pressing down, a shroud of worry and hardship woven from the fabric of society itself.\n\nThey call these the biological and sociocultural models, each trying to lay claim to the darkness that steals sleep. The biological folks, they talk of genes, of wiring in the brain gone awry. They point to the hypothalamus, a tiny part of the brain that acts like a switchboard for sleep and wakefulness, and they tell stories of neurons firing out of sync, of orexin, a chemical messenger, failing to do its job. They speak of mice, of experiments, of receptors and agonists, words that sound like whispers from the dark. They say a man's fate is written in his genes, that sleeplessness is a burden passed down through generations, a darkness inherited.\n\nThe others, the sociocultural folks, they look at the world outside the skull. They see the burdens of race and class, the weight of poverty and oppression, the gnawing anxieties of a world gone mad. They say that insomnia is not just a disease of the body, but a disease of the soul, a symptom of a society that forgets the simple human need for rest. They see the city lights, the endless hum of technology, the relentless pressure to perform, and they say, This is the world that steals sleep.\n\nBoth sides offer their explanations, their pieces of the puzzle. But the truth, it's probably somewhere in the shadows, a tangled knot of biology and circumstance, of genes and environment, of the whispers in the blood and the weight of the world.  And maybe, just maybe, the answer lies not in finding a cure, but in learning to live with the darkness, to find peace in the sleepless night.",
            "The barren land stretched out before him, gray and ash-covered, the wind sighing through the skeletal remains of trees.  A wasteland, silent save for the whisper of the wind and the distant, mournful cry of a crow.  This was the country of sounds uncaught, of words lost in the echoing emptiness. Here, in this desolate place, lived a boy and a man, bound together by a whispered word, a shared burden. The boy, with eyes wide and watchful, strained to hear the world around him, but the sounds were fragmented, incomplete.  His world was a tapestry woven with gaps, threads of sound tangled and broken.  This was the mark of the Silent World, a place where the ear heard but the mind could not grasp. \n\nThe man, his face etched with the weariness of a long road traveled, knew the boy's struggle.  He had seen it in the boy's frustration, in the way he would tilt his head, straining to catch the missing pieces of the spoken word.  He knew the boy's world was fractured, a mosaic of sound, incomplete and disjointed. This was the burden he carried, the burden of the Silent World.\n\nThey journeyed together, father and son, across this desolate landscape, their steps echoing on the cracked earth. The man, a silent guardian, watched over the boy, shielding him from the harshness of their reality. He knew the world could be a cruel place for those who could not hear it fully.\n\nThe man had learned to read the boy's world, to understand the subtle cues, the unspoken language of gestures and facial expressions. He spoke slowly, carefully, ensuring each word reached the boy's ears, each syllable a precious offering in a world where words could vanish like smoke on the wind.\n\nThey moved from place to place, seeking refuge in the remnants of a shattered world. The man had learned to read the signs, to detect the subtle hints of danger lurking in the silence. He knew the dangers of the Silent World, the predators who preyed on the vulnerable, the whispers of madness that could consume those who could not find their place in the world.\n\nHe held onto the hope that one day, the boy would find his voice, that the shattered pieces of his world would come together, forming a whole.  He held onto the hope that they could find a place where the silence wouldn't be so deafening, where the boy could hear the music of the world, the symphony of life playing out around them.",
            "The play unfolds like a shroud, revealing a truth that clings to the edges of deception. Twelfth Night whispers that disguise, a web spun fine and tight, can shelter a soul from harm but in the end, the threads must unravel. For a man or woman who lives in borrowed skin risks becoming lost, a ghost in a mask.\n\nThe rub lies in the tearing away. To uncloak is to face the chill of exposure, the judgment of those whose trust has been betrayed. Some may bear it, some may not.  Relationships, fragile things, can shatter under the weight of a revealed lie.\n\nGender, a slippery thing, becomes a quicksand in this play. Why, one wonders, would a soul choose to drown in the sea of another's identity? Viola, adrift in a foreign land, seeks refuge in the armor of masculinity. She declares, “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nBut her guise, crafted for survival, becomes a cage. She is cut off from the solace of her own kind, her feminine strength rendered invisible.  And in the mist of this masquerade, Olivia, entangled in a web of her own, mistakes Viola for a man, mistaking the reflection for the source.  “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). \n\nOrsino, too, is drawn into the dance, confessing to Viola/Cesario, “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).  Is this a progressive yearning for a love beyond convention? Or is it a reflection of the human heart, forever searching, forever seeking what it cannot name?\n\nOlivia’s swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, her acceptance of Viola as sister rather than lover, speaks of a society where appearances hold sway. Is she truly prejudiced against women? Or is she merely a product of her time, blind to the truth that lies beneath the surface?\n\nTwelfth Night, a play of shadows and light, exposes the human heart's capacity for both deceit and yearning. It reminds us that truth, like a fragile butterfly, must be handled with care, for its wings are easily broken.",
            "The land was marked by the ghosts of its own making. The skeletal bones of trees, bleached white against the dust-choked sky, spoke of a violence done, of a fire that had raged and consumed. This was German South West Africa, a place where the whispers of genocide still clung to the air, a stench of ash and sorrow clinging to the wind.  The Ovaherero and Nama, their names like broken promises, were swallowed by the earth, their spirits scattered on the plains.\n\nBut empires, even those stained with blood, weren't uniform.  Their shadows stretched long and twisted, casting different hues across their domains.  In Tanganyika, where the British later took root, they found a people who had tasted the bitter fruit of knowledge.  Schools, built by the Germans, stood as monuments to a different, perhaps more humane, vision.  In Kamerun and other corners, the whispers spoke of education, of progress, a faint echo of a forgotten dream.\n\nBut here, in this desolate kingdom, a different story unfolded.  The Germans, they came with promises of civilization, of progress, but their gaze fell upon the native souls with a cold indifference.  Education, for them, was a luxury reserved for the conquerors, not the conquered. The task of shaping minds was left to the missionaries, their words a flickering candle in the vast darkness.\n\nThe iron fist of the state, so strong in other colonies, was loose here.  The government, content to hoard its resources, turned a blind eye to the plight of the natives, their fate a matter of indifference.  Schools for the white settlers, those who claimed ownership of this barren land, were meticulously crafted, their halls echoing with the pronouncements of a superior race.  But the native children, their eyes filled with the despair of a forgotten world, were left to tread the dusty paths of ignorance.\n\nThis, then, was the legacy of German rule in South West Africa: a chasm of inequality, a scar etched deep into the soul of the land.  The echoes of their cruelty still reverberated through the ages, a testament to the enduring damage inflicted by the hunger for power and dominion.",
            "The air hangs thick with the sound of a hundred names, a hundred faces, a hundred stories crowding in on themselves. Popular music. A sprawling landscape, a graveyard of ghosts, all clamoring for a place in the sun. Rock, blues, country, folk, each a tattered banner waving in the wind, each a wound bleeding out its own unique song. And somewhere in that chaos, a knot of darkness tightened, a fist clenched around a microphone, a scream echoing through the canyons of sound. That was metal.\n\nForty years gone, and it's grown like a tumor, a cancer of the soul, branching and burrowing, feeding on the raw nerves of the world.  Subgenres bloom like mushrooms in the dark, each one a reflection of some inner hunger, some private hell.  Heavy metal, they called it, a name that whispered of doom and defiance.\n\nIt's a music born of shadows, a symphony of dissonance. More bass, more volume, more fury. A shriek of guitars, drums like thunderclaps, a voice that rips through the silence like a banshee.  A hunger for something primal, something real, something that could shake the very foundations of the world.\n\nIt's a music of excess, a testament to the limits of human endurance.  Drugs a fuel, a catalyst, a mask for the demons that danced in the shadows.  A generation fueled by the fires of rebellion, searching for meaning in a world that had turned its back on them. \n\nThey took the darkness, the rage, the despair, and they poured it into the music.  They borrowed from the past, from the Romantics who wept for the beauty of decay, from the bluesmen who sang of heartbreak and loss, from the ancient myths that whispered of gods and monsters.  They wove it all together into a tapestry of sound, a dark and glorious tapestry that reflected the broken world around them.\n\nThere's a line in a song, a line that captures the essence of it all: \"Helter Skelter.\" The Beatles, they called it. A glimpse into a world teetering on the edge, a world drowning in its own madness. It wasn't just the music, it was the message.  A scream into the void, a plea for something more.\n\nAnd it found its echo in the hearts of those who felt lost, those who craved something more than the mundane, something that could make them feel alive.",
            "The year was 1910. Henri Rousseau, a man haunted by dreams both literal and figurative, set his brush to canvas. The Dream, the painting he birthed, wasn't just a woman lost in a fantastical landscape. It was Rousseau’s soul laid bare, a testament to the internal struggle that gnawed at him. For years, he'd dreamt of the art world’s embrace, of the whispers of praise, the murmur of recognition. But the path to such acclaim seemed blocked, a thorny thicket of convention and expectation.  He yearned to be seen, but could he be seen for who he truly was, or would he be forced to bend his vision to the will of the critics he so desperately sought to please?\n\nBefore you can truly understand The Dream, you need to know the man behind the brush. Henri Rousseau, born in the year 1844, was a man of humble beginnings. His father, a tinsmith, toiled for a living, and young Henri was raised in the shadow of his father's modest prosperity.  He never received formal training in art, instead finding himself bound to a life of public service, a gabelou, a toll collector for the French government. His early years were marked by tragedy, the loss of a wife and eight children leaving him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his solace, a window into a world where his dreams could take flight.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance wasn't born from vanity. He wasn't trying to be the darling of the art world; he simply wanted to be seen, to have his work understood. He was a man of the people, a folk artist who captured their hopes and dreams in his paintings. However, the art world he entered was dominated by artists with pedigrees and connections, artists like Matisse, whose talent was undeniable, whose path to fame seemed easy. Rousseau, a self-taught outsider, felt the weight of their success, the pressure to conform, to mimic their style, to earn a place at their table. The question that haunted him was this: could he find his own voice, his own truth, without losing the very thing he longed for - recognition? \n\nAnd so, within The Dream, we see the reflection of this struggle. It's a painting that speaks not only of a woman lost in a fantastical world, but also of a man lost in the labyrinth of his own desires. A man searching for a place where his dreams could finally take root, where he could finally be seen for the artist he truly was.",
            "The line between what's right and what's fair, they say, it runs thin as a razor. And that notion, it echoes in the silence of a dusty room, in the brushstrokes of a faded canvas. There's a truth to it, a kind of knowing, that hums beneath the surface. Like the sun on a cracked windowpane, it casts a pale light on things we can't quite grasp. \n\nMen have tried to pin it down, this truth, this beauty. Keats, he saw it in a silent urn, a frozen moment of grace. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he wrote. But even in his words, it feels like a whisper on the wind, something glimpsed at the edge of vision. We learn things, sure. We read books, we swallow lessons whole. But this... this is different. \n\nIt's in the way a rain-soaked canvas holds the memory of a storm, in the ache of a melody that speaks to a forgotten longing. It's in the silences between the words, in the spaces where the soul slips through.\n\nWe dissect art, we analyze morals, but the heart of it, the soul of it, that remains elusive. We talk about brushstrokes and composition, about right and wrong, but the essence, the spark, it's always just beyond our reach. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" And it's true. Words can stumble, they can fall short. But stories, they hold the weight of unspoken truths, the echoes of a deeper knowing.\n\nAnd ethics? It's the same. We build codes, we argue points, but the true heart of it, that resides in the realm of the unspoken, the ineffable. It's a feeling, a gut-knowing, that transcends the reach of language.\n\nKeats, O'Connor, Wittgenstein, they all sensed it. That something more, that thing that whispers in the darkness, that makes us shiver and sigh and reach for understanding. It's the thread that runs through art and ethics, a connection woven in the fabric of our being. It's the language of the soul.",
            "The ghost of a country, Germany, lingers still. A specter of power, stitched together from the shadows of the Alps where München sleeps, to the salt-laced breath of Kiel on the Baltic. A single soul, beating beneath the weight of its history, felt from the cobbled streets of Köln, down the Rhine to the Saxon city of Dresden, clinging to the Elbe. This Germany, forged in blood and ash, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, whispers its past in every windswept stone.\n\nGermania, the ancestral cradle. The name itself a wound, its origins a maze of contested theories. Tacitus, in his ancient chronicle, claimed it stemmed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed the Rhine before clashing with the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his own testament to conquest, a term to mark the difference between the vanquished Gauls and those who remained free, those who fought under the furs and iron of the north. Some say it came from the Gauls themselves, a word for those who lived beyond the known world. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of this land, of the \"Germans who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" But others whisper of a different origin, a weapon forged in the heart of Germania, the spear known as the \"ger,\" or perhaps a word from the ancient tongue of the Irish, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the thunderous voices of a people who knew only war and freedom.\n\nTacitus, in his own grim testament to the German spirit, wrote of a people untouched by the tide of history, a people who had never left their ancestral lands: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He paints a picture of a land untouched by Rome, a land of wild beauty and harshness, a land where the air itself tasted of iron and frost.  \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive,\" he writes, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"  \n\nAnd indeed, the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, bartered for its riches, and took what they could, but the heart of Germany, its unyielding spirit, remained untamed. The Germanic tribes, ever vigilant, traded their wares and fought in the legions of Rome, forever a thorn in the side of the empire.",
            "The brown water churned, a thick slurry of some nameless thing.  His hand hovered, a pale ghost over the porcelain rim. He didn't look down. Didn't need to. The shape of it was etched already on the back of his eyelids. A stain in the white emptiness. The slick sheen of it, the pale brown fringe. He thought of the artist's book, the one he'd bought on a whim.  \"See the world as a simple shape,\" it said.  A bowl of fruit, a face, a goddamn turd in a bowl. But the world always held more than shapes, didn't it? \n\nHe remembered the quiet days spent poring over those pages, a desperate hunger for understanding gnawing at him.  Picasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Renaissance riot of color. He'd wanted to find his own palette, his own story.  Maybe it had begun here, in this dim-lit bathroom, with the stench of bleach and despair clinging to the air. \n\nHis hand moved, a twitch of muscle, a spasm of will.  He gripped the handle, a cold metal in his sweaty palm.  He wouldn't flinch.  He wouldn't think. Just move.  A single flush, a gurgle, a sigh of relief.  The shape remained, stubborn and defiant.  He squeezed his eyes shut, willing it away.\n\nHe reached for the mop, the handle slick and damp.  Green tie choking him, he stared at the brown stain.  A single thought, clear and sharp, pierced the fog: This was his canvas, this was his brush, and this goddamn turd was his muse.",
            "The road runs black and slick with the rain. They say the young ones are dying on it, these boys behind the wheel, their blood blooming on asphalt.  A kind of sickness in the blood, that's what it is. The brain, they say, it ain't finished yet. Not ready for the weight of it all.  A machine meant for humming along, carrying dreams and  dead ends, becomes a tomb.\n\n*They* say the numbers tell the story. More accidents, more rollovers, more of them going off the road, lost and foolish.  And they're not alone.

Licenses for the young, a kind of probation,  hours set, passengers banned. A band-aid on a festering wound.\n\nThe truth is, the young ones are wired different.

            "The Library of Congress, a vast repository of forgotten things, held a trove of Edison's early films. Among them, fifteen trick films, flickering shadows from the years 1895 to 1901. Illusions woven from the nascent art of editing, they whispered of a time before the moving picture had found its voice. My study of these films sought to unravel the poetics, the common thread that bound them, while also peering into the nascent wrinkles of evolution that creased a few of the later works.\n\nThe trick films of the turn of the century, for the most part, were creatures of constraint. They lived within the confines of a stage, a proscenium frame that held them captive. The camera, a silent observer, never strayed from its fixed position. It was a world of frozen moments, of figures confined to a single plane, moving side to side like ghosts in a box.\n\nThe influence of the stage, of vaudeville and magic, lingered heavy in these films. Actors, bound by the stage's limitations, never ventured towards or away from the camera. Think of \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where the actors, like marionettes, danced along a horizontal axis, never breaking the confines of the frame. \n\nThe world of these trick films was a stage, the camera a distant eye fixed upon it. Long shots, and occasionally medium shots, were all that filled the frame. Close-ups, a language yet to be discovered, were absent. The audience, like those in the old theaters, saw the whole performance laid bare, confined by the proscenium's rigid embrace.\n\nThe films themselves were structured like a single, unbroken breath. Each concept, each trick, was captured in a single shot, a film. This limited their length, their narratives, to the brevity of a fleeting moment.  They were vaudeville sketches, glimpses of magic, disappearing acts, woven together with tricks that defied the eye. But even within this constraint, there were whispers of change. \n\nExamine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, where a single shot is stitched together to create the illusion of a severed head.  A hint, a promise, of a more complex language to come.",
            "John Taylor, a man of Caroline, spoke with the fire of a young Republic in his belly. His life was bound to the soil, a farmer through and through, but the land had forged in him a spirit that echoed in the halls of Congress. He was known for his words, for the way he stood against the tide, a bulwark against what he saw as the encroaching hand of the state.  His faith in the life of the soil, in the sweat of the brow, colored every argument, every conviction. It was this devotion to the farmer, this belief that agriculture was the true backbone of a nation, that fueled his fire on matters of sovereignty, of the very meaning of the Constitution, even the way justice was dispensed.\n\n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to build something different, something better. A clean slate, unburdened by the dead weight of tradition. He believed in the innate rights of man, rights woven into the fabric of existence, rights that were all interconnected, each dependent on the other. If one was trampled, they all withered. These rights, he claimed, were sacred, beyond the reach of any government, any man. He spoke of a \"state of nature,\" a world where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning ruled over virtue. But in a civilized society, he argued, this had to change.\n\nThis ideal society, this haven of liberty, could only be built on a government that understood the duality of man, the inherent good and the ever-present evil. He was a man of stark contrasts, a believer in black and white, in the fundamental nature of good and evil. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.” He defined good principles as those that protected private property, those that nurtured the land, and those that kept the wolf of unchecked capitalism at bay. He believed that a government built on these principles, even if administered by men driven by avarice and self-interest, would somehow find a balance, a way to function fairly. He saw self-interest as the engine of man, a force that could be harnessed for the common good, but that could also lead to chaos if left unchecked.\n\nTaylor was a strict constructionist, a man who believed in the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. He craved a limited federal government, one that held no more power than that explicitly granted to it. He saw a large, expansive government as a threat, a breeding ground for tyranny. But he also feared a blind, literal interpretation of the law, a rigid adherence to words that could twist and turn into something monstrous. He found solace in the Declaration of Independence, a document that, he believed, more clearly articulated the nature of the United States as a union of sovereign states, rather than a single, indivisible nation.",
            "The numbers in Figure 17, they fell off a precipice come the third month. A hard thing to swallow, that. The why of it, though, it's a riddle wrapped in a shroud. Winter's grip on this New England campus, you see, it chills the bones, and folks tend to stay inside. Bikes and footpaths, they fall silent then. And December, that's a month of deadlines and grades, of frantic packing and a desperate clinging to the last embers of freedom before the long holiday break. A commuter log, it's a small thing, easy to forget in the rush. Then the break itself, a month of silence and absence. Not even the ghosts of commuters linger on the paths. January, its return a slow, hesitant bloom, a trickle of life returning to the frozen ground. But February, that was a deeper chill. A hollow space where the numbers should have been.\n\nThere's a weariness to these things, a natural ebb and flow. Like the tide, the initial surge of enthusiasm recedes, leaving behind a quiet stillness. We tried to fight it, to shore up the banks with the Carpool Challenge Week. A blitz, a burst of energy in March, and the numbers rose again, but the underlying current, it remained.\n\nThe truth is, the car, it's a siren song, a deep-rooted yearning for freedom on the open road. It's woven into the very fabric of this society. So, we offered enticements. Gift certificates, a taste of sweetness to draw them in. Restaurants, coffee shops, massages, even books and trinkets. It was a good start, but I wonder, would a bolder gesture have swayed them? A bicycle, a hybrid, a whisper of electric promise. Perhaps a bigger prize, a beacon in the darkness, might have kept the flame alive.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same, a constant hum of reward. But what if they had grown, evolved with the project? A promise of a bicycle in December, a hybrid in January, a whisper of electric freedom in February. Would it have been enough to keep the numbers climbing, to break through the winter's chill?",
            "The road stretched black and empty, a ribbon of ash against the dying light.  An ETF, they called it. A basket of stocks, a gamble cast on the board of the market.  Like a preacher's promise, it whispered of diversification, of low fees, of easy wealth.  But the devil, they said, is in the details.\n\nThis ETF, IHF, they called it.  A cage full of caged birds, each a company, a name on a ticker tape, a sliver of ownership in the vast machine.  The brochure spoke of its holdings, ten companies locked inside, their percentage of the whole laid out like sins laid bare. Sixty-three percent, it claimed, of the ETF's heart beat within those ten.\n\nBut was it a heart at all?  A beating flesh and blood thing? Or a hollow shell, a brittle cage rattling in the wind?  To find out, you had to look closer, to see beyond the glossy promise.\n\nSo I took those ten companies, those caged birds, and I set them free.  I measured their wings, their flight, their hunger.  I saw their shadows stretching long and lean against the horizon of the market.  Their returns, their risks, their stories whispered in the language of numbers.\n\nThe ETF, it promised a steady flight, a measured climb.  But the ten, they danced to a different tune.  Some soared high, some dipped low, some crashed and burned.  In their chaos, a truth began to emerge.\n\nThe ETF, it was a lie, a smoothed-over surface, a painted smile upon a cracked face.  The ten, they were the real thing, raw and wild, a reflection of the market's own untamed heart.  You could watch them, study them, understand them better than you ever could the gilded cage that claimed to contain them.\n\nThe question then was not whether the ETF was better, but whether it was necessary.  Was the cage, with its assurances and its limitations, worth the price of its confinement?  Or was freedom, even in its chaos, a better gamble?",
            "The dark land of dream, that’s what they called it. Poe dreamt it up, called it Thulé, a word that echoed back from some old man’s book, Virgil’s maybe. A place north of Britain, the edge of the world, where the Greeks kept their shadows. Poe knew these things, these forgotten words. He’d swallowed them whole, like the German poets he admired, swallowed Goethe too, whole and undigested. \n\nSome say Poe was just copying, mimicking the shadows of a greater man. This Arndt fella, he saw it, said Poe was just a pale reflection of Goethe’s King of Thulé. A king drowning in grief, a goblet clutched in his hand, a memory of his dead queen tasting bitter on his tongue. A king who walked to the edge of the world, tossed the goblet into the black water and let go.\n\nGoethe’s Faust, they said, that was the real thing. A play in two parts, the first born in 1808, the second when the old man himself breathed his last.  A king, a goblet, a death. Poe, they say, he knew the story. Heard it whispered in the wind, saw it in his own dreams. He’d even read it in that play, Faust, a few years before he wrote his own dark poem, The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nThulé, the name echoed, twice in Poe’s own work. First in The Pit, then again in Dream-Land, like a bookend to the darkness. The king in Dream-Land, he’s a ghost of the king in Thulé.  Alone, haunted by his memories, seeing the world in shades of gray. Another king, lost in his own grief. \n\nPoe, he knew Goethe. Maybe not in person, but he knew him through the words, through the echoes that resonated in his own soul.  He knew him because he knew Tennyson, who knew him too. And Poe, he knew the power of words, the way they could shape and mold a man’s soul.",
            "The applesauce lay slick on the linoleum, a slick smear of crimson against the dull tile. A stain, a testament. She came in like a whisper, a shift of shadows in the aisles, and the floor betrayed her.  He, the manager, had known. Twice he’d been told. Twice the warning had crawled into his ears, a whine barely audible over the hum of fluorescent lights and the clatter of carts. Twice he’d brushed it aside. Dinner, he’d mumbled. No time for complaints. But the smell of applesauce, cloying and sweet, had lingered, a phantom promise of trouble. Now, the silence held a different kind of weight, a heavy sigh of consequence. \n\nThe law, it whispers, speaks of malice, of a disregard for the possible harm.  Willfulness. A conscious choice to ignore the danger, like a man who dances with a loaded gun.  Six times before, they’d tripped, stumbled, fallen.  Six times the warning had been sounded. And six times, the music played on.\n\nShe, the injured one, will say he knew. He knew the floor was a trap, a waiting snare.  He knew the applesauce would become a slick, crimson ribbon, a path to pain. And he chose to look away.\n\nThey’ll talk of “despicable,” a word that hangs in the air, heavy with judgment.  They’ll dissect his actions, weigh them against the scales of justice. And he, the man who shut his eyes to the danger, will stand accused.  \n\nThe law, it is a cold, sharp blade. It cuts through the pretense, the justifications, and lays bare the truth.  And in the cold light of that truth,  he will have to answer.",
            "The dust had settled four years gone, back when the air still hummed with the echo of that first class on Islam at CBC. They argued then about the nature of the faith, whether it was a wolf in sheep's clothing or some lamb of God.  But the world's turned, spun itself on its axis since then, and the question seems sharper now, more urgent. The newsmen, they shifted their stance, once painting Islam with the same brush as those desert devils, now fawning over it, a reverence bordering on the absurd.  You wouldn't have caught a candidate with a name like Borac Obama back then, a name that whispers of a faith that was once vilified, a faith that now seems to walk hand-in-hand with the President himself.\n\nThey say the Prophet's story is one of humility, a man misunderstood, a gentle soul who drew others in with his words.  But the stories I knew, the ones etched in my memory, spoke of conquest, of swords and fire, of tribes forced to bend the knee.  They painted him a warrior, not a shepherd.  This new portrait, this biography, whispers of a different man, a man who needed no force, only truth, a man who drew men to him like moths to a flame.  \n\nAnd yet, there's a shadow of familiarity in the tales, echoes that resonate with the whispers of another story, another prophet, another miracle.  The multiplying mutton, the shared milk, a story that speaks of a power beyond man, a power that echoes across time and faith.  But it's a shadow, a pale imitation, a false dawn.  It diminishes the wonder of the true miracle, the life and death of Christ, a light that shines brighter than any borrowed flame.\n\nThese stories, these “proofs,” they twist and turn, relying on a chain of whispers, a game of telephone passed down through generations.  They lack the weight of firsthand experience, the tangibility of truth.  Instead, they offer a flimsy tapestry woven with doubt, a fragile construct that crumbles under scrutiny.\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that chills me to the bone, is the attempt to paint Muhammad as a saint, a beacon of light, a gentle soul.  But history whispers a different tale, a tale of ambition, of conquest, a tale that clashes with this romanticized vision.  And I wonder, I truly wonder, if the faithful know the true story, the story hidden beneath the layers of myth and legend, the story of the man behind the mask.",
            "The words of the man from Nazareth, they faded fast. Like dust on the wind. The faith that bloomed in his wake, it twisted.  Bent and warped by the hands of men, reaching for power, for comfort, for a God shaped in their own image. \n\nThe world spins on, restless and hungry. A thirst for change, for something new, it burns in the hearts of men. Old ways crumble, cast aside like worn-out clothes. But those who cling to the shadows, they fear the light. They clutch their scriptures tight, afraid to see what lies beyond.\n\nYet a whisper stirs. A yearning for truth. A hunger for the primal word, untainted by the accretions of time. It will grow, this yearning, a tide rising against the shore.  Decades will pass, centuries may fall, but the tide will rise.  The clock will turn back, its hands unwinding the knots of dogma, unraveling the layers of man-made belief.  What remains will be the bare bones of the man from Nazareth's message, stripped and stark.\n\nAnd when this tide reaches the shores of the known world, a new dawn will break. Churches, those monuments to man's striving, will stand tall, but within their walls, the echoes will change. The multitude will gather, not to hear the pronouncements of men, but to listen to the whispers of the heart.  \n\nDiversity will give way to unity, not of doctrine, but of spirit.  The divisions that scar the landscape of faith will fade, leaving a canvas washed clean.  History itself will bend, its arc tracing a path back to the source. A reversion, yes, but not a simple turning back. It will be a rebirth, a return to the wellspring, a rediscovering of the man and his message, stripped bare, raw and true.\n\nLook to the past, for in its shadows, the future hides.  Remember the rise of the eagle, the fall of empires, the slow crawl of progress.  History is a river, ever flowing, ever changing.  And in its depths, the seeds of the future lie waiting. \n\nJudaism, the cradle of faith, stands silent witness. Monotheism, the yearning for a single truth, echoes in the wind. The Hebrew scriptures, a beacon in the darkness, guide the way. There, in the heart of those ancient words, the seed of the man from Nazareth took root.",
            "The smoke rose from the factories, a black river against the sky. The buildings, stark and unforgiving, pressed in on the huddled workers,  their lives as expendable as the meat that passed through their hands. Greed, it seemed, was the only law in this place. The owners, fat and bloated on the spoils of their industry, cared nothing for the men and women who fueled their fortunes. They saw them as cogs in a machine, their labor a necessary evil, their suffering an acceptable cost. \n\nSinclair’s words, sharp as a butcher’s blade, cut through the veil of complacency: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This was no mere industry; it was a den of vipers, a place where humanity was devoured by the insatiable maw of profit.\n\nThe air itself was thick with rot, the stench of blood and decay mingling with the acrid tang of coal smoke. A man's life was measured in hours, in the relentless march of the clock, his body broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of endless labor.  \n\n\"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  These were not men; they were ghosts, their faces hollowed by hunger and fatigue, their eyes dulled by the endless grind. The owners, cloaked in their wealth, saw them as nothing more than meat, expendable and replaceable.\n\nThe Jungle was a labyrinth of despair, its walls closing in on its inhabitants, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. There were whispers of unions, flickering flames of hope struggling against the wind, but they were often corrupted, their promises as hollow as the factories themselves.  The workers, their backs bent under the yoke of oppression, had become slaves to a system that offered no escape, no redemption.\n\nSinclair's words echoed the horror, the overwhelming sense of helplessness: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "The way a man shapes a story, the feeling he wants it to hold, that’s a thing of power. Some ways are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In his *Gatsby*, he paints with words, not just with brushstrokes, but with the colors themselves. Gold, green, white, red, each one a whisper, a secret understood only by the heart. He builds meaning, layer upon layer, till the colors sing.\n\nHe uses white and gray like a shroud, a blanket of uniformity. White, the clean, the bright, the promise of something better. Gray, the faded, the worn, the forgotten.  He drapes this white and gray over Daisy and Jordan, always in white, a ghostly procession. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, even Catherine powdered milky white.  It's as if the world itself is trying to smother itself in this sterile light.  And then there are the names, lost in the gray, souls swallowed by the city.\n\nHe paints the streets in shades of white and gray:  the \"white chasms\" of the city, the \"gray cars,\" the \"gray land.\"  And the people, they are shades too.  Jordan and Daisy, their girlhood a \"white\" thing. The Italian child, gray. The dog seller, a \"gray old man.\"\n\nThen, Fitzgerald takes this weight of white and gray and lays it upon Daisy. He wraps her in it, until she becomes a symbol, a desire, a phantom.  The \"white roadster,\" the \"white girlhood,\" a \"gray haze\" of fur.  She's not a woman, not anymore. She's an idea, an echo of something lost.",
            "The dust hung low over the valley, a shroud of bone-white in the dying light.  San Diego County, they called it. Once a land of plenty, choked now with the bones of what had been. Tomatoes, citrus, greens - ghosts of bounty, whispers in the wind. The land remembered, though. The sun still kissed it, a pale, indifferent fire. \n\nFolks here, they spoke of a different kind of plenty - organic, they called it. A word that meant something different now. A way to coax life from the ash, to feed the ghosts. A market for it, they said, a hungry maw for the pure and the simple. Eggs, milk, honey - all carried on the backs of weary hands and the dreams of men who still believed in the soil.\n\nThere was a farm, a teardrop of green in the vastness, nestled near the town of Potrero. An old homestead, they said, where shadows danced in the chaparral and the wind carried the ghosts of cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. A hundred species, they said, lived there, or at least the remnants of them. A kangaroo rat, a frog, butterflies, a small, gray bird with a song like a sigh. All clinging to life, to the memory of what had been.\n\nThis land, it held memories. A hundred years, maybe more, etched in the dust and the gnarled roots of the oak trees. A place where the wild still whispered, where the echoes of ancient stories lingered. But the whisper was fading, the stories becoming lost. \n\nThe man who dreamt of this farm, he looked at the land with tired eyes. He saw the emptiness, the ghosts of abundance, the fragile life clinging to the edge. He saw a chance, a flicker of hope in the dying light. He saw a way to bring back some of the lost beauty, to feed the ghosts, to keep the whispers alive. He saw a chance to fight against the ash, to plant a seed in the dust.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, carrying whispers of dust and the ghosts of old bargains. Culture, it settled on a man like ash, clinging to his bones, shaping the way he breathed, the way he saw the world. Not a thing you could hold in your hand, no, but a current, a tide pulling at his soul.  It was in the way a man looked at you, the way he held his silence, the way his hand moved to touch his face when he spoke of family. You couldn't judge a man by the dirt on his boots, but you could judge him by the ghosts that rode with him.\n\nThey say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating.  Words like stones tossed carelessly, skipping across the surface of a deep well.  A man's heart held more secrets than any book. To understand him, you had to look beyond the broad strokes, the clichés painted on a canvas too wide to hold the truth. \n\nWhen you crossed into a new land, you saw it through the lens of your own storms, your own sunrises. But the echoes in those eyes, the way they held the weight of a thousand unspoken histories, those belonged to them, not to you. You could learn, though. You could learn the language of their silence, the rhythm of their laughter. You could learn to read the lines on their faces, the stories etched there by the winds of their lives.\n\nAnd in the heart of a negotiation, where the stakes were high and the air thick with unspoken promises, understanding was the only currency that mattered. A man who knew the song of another's soul, who understood the weight of their history, he was a man who could make a deal. He could bridge the chasms of difference, find common ground in the desolate landscape of mistrust.",
            "The fool says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This echo of Psalm 14 bleeds into the marrow of St. Anselm's bones, his argument a prayer whispered against the encroaching dark. It’s a dark that Thomas Aquinas, too, would find himself wrestling with, each man reaching for the same light, the same God of the Bible, a God whose shape is already etched in their minds. \n\nBut the question burns: Is either man truly illuminating the path, or are they merely tracing shadows? To answer, we must assume, for the sake of this reckoning, that they both see the same God, the God of scripture, the God who breathes life into the dusty pages.  \n\nAnselm’s path is inward, a pilgrimage through the caverns of the soul. He believes God resides within the mind, a truth so self-evident that to doubt him is to deny the very essence of thought itself.  He speaks of faith as a light flickering in the dark, a conviction born not of proof but of the soul’s own knowing. The burden of proof, he suggests, lies not in the external world but in the silence of the heart.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different road. He seeks God’s fingerprint in the world, in the rustling leaves, the turning tide, the very fabric of existence. His five proofs are stones laid in the path, each one a testament to the divine logic that underpins the universe. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony – these are the whispers of God’s hand, the echoes of his presence in the world of sense.  He offers not faith but reason, a map drawn in the language of logic, a blueprint for understanding God through the very world God created.\n\nBut do these paths truly lead to the same destination? Does Anselm’s inward journey illuminate the same God as Aquinas’s outward gaze? Or do they merely offer two different perspectives on the same mystery?  The answer, perhaps, lies not in the certainty of their arguments but in the enduring question they both leave us with: Is there a God who exists beyond the reach of our senses, beyond the grasp of our logic, a God who whispers his truth in the silence of the soul, and who writes his story in the grand tapestry of the universe?",
            "The dust of time had settled on the man's story, obscuring the clarity of his beginnings. Born a prince, they said, he'd walked away from it all.  The world had held him in its sway, but he'd found escape in the silence of his own making. They called him Buddha, a name whispered in the hush of temples and chanted in the wind. He'd gathered his teachings, spun them into threads of wisdom, and woven them into a tapestry known as Dhamma. And from that cloth, a faith was born – Theravada, the ancient way. \n\nBut time, like a river, flows ever onward. The world shifted, the sun rose and set upon a thousand seasons, and the shape of faith changed too. In Sri Lanka, where the echoes of his words still lingered, they held to the water-cutting ceremony. A custom not born of his own lips, yet embraced nonetheless. A shadow of change, flickering in the margins of the ancient light.\n\nThis was not a simple matter of faded robes and altered rituals. It was a deeper thing, a subtle turning within the soul of the faith. The monks, cloaked in saffron, and the laity, their lives interwoven with the fabric of the world, both felt the shift. The doctrines, once stark and clear, began to bend in the wind, their edges softened by the passage of time.\n\nTo understand this, one must first grasp the forces that shaped it. The internal forces, those born from within the community itself, monks and laymen alike. And the external, the voices from beyond the walls of the temple, a chorus of voices, some friendly, some hostile, all seeking to leave their mark.\n\nAt the heart of it all lay the core belief – refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast ocean of wisdom contained in the Tripitaka – the three baskets of scripture. The Suttas, the Vinaya, the Abhidhamma. These texts spoke of impermanence, of suffering, of the endless cycle of rebirth. They spoke of the emptiness of the self, the fire of desire, and the path to liberation. \n\nBut even the most sacred teachings are not immune to change. The world outside, with its shifting sands and restless tides, inevitably found its way in. And within, the human heart, ever yearning and ever changing, sought its own expression. The water-cutting ceremony, a silent testament to this, flowed on, a ripple in the vastness of time.",
            "The border between them, a scar across the land, had bled for fifty-seven years. From 1836 till 1893, the United States and Mexico danced a bloody waltz, a tango of distrust and hate.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high note, the crescendo of this discord, came with the war of 1846. The Americans, hungry and grasping, swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving Mexico drained and broken.   \n\nBut the skirmishes, the whispers of war, had been there long before.  They weren't born from a single cause, but from a tangled web of differences. Religion, culture, the very soul of each nation, clashed against the other. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).  Like a hunter stalking its prey, this blood feud echoed in other borders, in other lands where nations, neighbors, turned on one another. \n\nDavid M. Pletcher, in his study of these tangled affairs, said it plainly: “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Geography, a constant reminder of their proximity, a knife twisting in the wound. \n\nThe weight of religion, a heavy cross, pressed down on their relationship.  Sally Frahm, in her examination of this history, wrote, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). Like the Cold War, another struggle born of ideology, but in this case, it was not communism or capital, but God and faith that stood in the way. The ghosts of the Spanish and English, their old quarrels echoing across generations, poisoned the well of goodwill.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed seventeen disputes, seventeen wounds, in those fifty-seven years. Most were over land, over the shifting sands of borders, over the audacity of bandits who crossed from one side to the other. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The violence, a feral thing, seemed to seep from the land itself. \n\nSchmitt (1974) points out that as Mexico grew dependent on the United States, the animosity waned. The hunger for land was replaced by a hunger for something else, something more insidious: control. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",

            "The way things grow, the way they change... it's a mystery. Even the old books, they barely scratch the surface. Like a man trying to map the dark with a candle's flicker.  D'Arcy Thompson, he said it back in '17, that we ain't even begun to speak the language of life, to capture it in numbers. But maybe now, with these new tools, these equations, we can start to pry open the secrets. We're looking at a kind of shell, a spiral, a Prunum.  It builds itself, layer by layer, over time. And we're trying to see how it does it, what forces pull it this way, what boundaries hold it back. We take pictures, X-rays, to see the bones inside, the structure. Then we feed those pictures into a machine, a  thing called CerioShell. It can build shells, not real ones, but  shadows, possibilities.  \n\nIt's like looking at a river carving its way through stone.

            "The dust of mortality hung heavy over Indonesia. The children, the frailest reeds in the field of life, withered still, their numbers clinging to the same grim tally for a decade. Though the land had made strides on some paths – water, sanitation, a semblance of progress – the road to healthy mothers and children remained choked with thorns. They aimed for a finish line in 2015, a phantom date in a fog of want. But the truth, etched in the quiet despair of a mother's eyes, was that the race was far from won. \n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, a figure that shimmered on the page, 72% now. But those numbers were hollow. Did they include the women who knew the ways of the world but not the ways of medicine? Did they count the midwives, who could soothe a birth but not staunch a hemorrhage?  Even the numbers whispered of a deeper truth: the mothers, the blood-soaked vessels of life, were left to bleed in the shadows. \n\nDiarrhea, the scourge of the young, stalked the land, but even when it gripped a child, the reach of a doctor's hand was often too short. Postnatal care, a fragile promise whispered to new mothers, was a threadbare blanket in a cold world.\n\nCesarean sections, a last resort, a lifeline in a storm, were scarce. 4%. A whisper of a chance in a land where life hung by a thread.  The city, a beacon of hope, boasted 7%, while the countryside, a shadowed valley, offered only 2%. The chasm between them was a canyon of despair, a testament to the uneven hand of progress.\n\nAnd then there was the question of equity, the unspoken ache in the heart of the nation.  The poorest, those who could least afford it, were locked out of the sanctuaries of healing. A 27% gap. A chasm of opportunity, of life.\n\nSo they stood at a crossroads. Should they build more roads, more clinics, more programs? Or should they build a stronger foundation, a system that could withstand the storms of poverty and neglect? \n\nThe allure of quick fixes, of targeted solutions, was strong. But history whispered a warning.  Programs, like children, could grow too tall, too quickly, and topple.  Resources, like water, could be diverted to the highest bidder, leaving the parched land to wither.\n\nThe answer, the old men said, lay not in a single solution but in a web of care, woven strong and deep. A system that nurtured not just bodies but spirits, that reached into the shadows and pulled forth the forgotten, the abandoned. A system that held up a mirror to the nation and dared it to see itself, not as it was, but as it could be.",
            "The world of Victorian novels is a place of meticulous detail, a world where the aristocracy reigns supreme. Yet, within this tapestry of societal norms, two tales emerge, defying the rigid conventions of their time: <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Both novels weave through the darkness, venturing into the labyrinth of mystery and the realm of the bizarre, offering a glimpse into the tormented souls that inhabit them. This unsettling departure from the expected strengthens the narrative, illuminating the characters' motivations and exposing the depths of their emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from <i>Oliver Twist</i>: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese dreamlike visions, recurring throughout the novel, offer a glimpse into the recesses of Oliver's tormented soul. They reveal his pain, his confusion, and his growing awareness of the harsh reality that surrounds him.  The shooting, when revisited in chapter 28, unfolds as a vivid hallucination, mirroring Oliver's desperate struggle for survival. The passage emphasizes the overwhelming sense of powerlessness that consumes him. His senses are numbed as he is carried away by an unseen force, unable to control his fate. The pain, constant and relentless, becomes a chilling reminder of his vulnerability. \n\nOliver's helplessness begs the question: who is truly in control of his destiny? Is it his own, or is he merely a pawn in the hands of fate, manipulated by the cruel machinations of others, particularly the menacing figure of Fagin? This brutal reality shatters any illusions of agency, leaving Oliver adrift in a sea of despair.\n\n\nIn Emily Brontë's *Wuthering Heights*, the use of mystery and the macabre takes on a different form, often manifesting as haunting premonitions and spectral presences. \n\n\nThe pervasive darkness of the Yorkshire moors, the wild passions of the characters, and the lingering shadows of the past all contribute to a sense of unease that permeates the narrative. This haunting atmosphere serves to amplify the characters' internal struggles, blurring the lines between reality and madness. \n\n\nLike Oliver Twist, *Wuthering Heights* confronts themes of social injustice and the destructive consequences of unchecked desire. However, the novel's exploration of these themes is more complex and multifaceted, delving into the darker recesses of the human psyche.",
            "The dust of the after school settled as I watched him, Adrian. Maybe third, maybe fourth grade, lost in a world of letters that didn't seem to make sense. He'd pronounce some right, others like a stranger speaking a foreign tongue. It was a puzzle, because the boy spoke English clear as day.  His skin, the color of sun-baked clay, held the stories of a heritage not his own, a language humming just beneath the surface. I knew then, as clear as the desert sky, that the problem wasn't in his knowing, but in the knowing he lacked.\n\nHis mother came then, a woman of shadows and whispers, her words a storm of wind I couldn't grasp. My Spanish, a meager shield against a torrent, barely held. But in the broken fragments, the truth surfaced. He read, he just didn't know the alphabet. The English one. The ghost of a smile crossed my face, a beacon in the fog.\n\nAdrian, he was fine. He just needed a map, a guide to navigate the strange terrain of letters. A simple thing, really. But for the countless others, the children swallowed by the vastness of a language not their own, the path is long and winding. There's no single key, no magic spell to unlock the door. It takes a chorus of voices, a symphony of approaches.\n\nWe need the dual language system, a bridge between worlds. Not just for the Spanish speakers, but for every child, a tapestry woven with threads of understanding. We need tutors, guides, beacons in the linguistic darkness. We need immersion, a baptism in the language of opportunity.\n\nThe fear, the whispers of wasted resources, they are the ghosts of indifference.  The answer lies not in isolation, but in communion, in the shared language of learning. The future, the children, they are the hostages of this silence. Let us be their translators, their guides, their voices in the wilderness.",
            "The rain fell hard on the tin roof, a steady drumbeat against the silence that had settled in. It was the kind of rain that washed away the world, leaving only the grey sky and the slick, dark wood of the porch. We sat there, my father and I, two shadows against the flickering light of the porch lamp. He held a cigarette between his fingers, the ember a red eye in the gloom, and stared out at the world dissolving in the storm.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice hoarse, as if unused. His eyes, though, were on something else, some place beyond the rain, beyond the porch, beyond the world I knew.  A place I couldn't see. \n\nHe had grown thin, his clothes hanging loose on his frame like rags on a skeleton. The hair that was once thick and dark was now sparse, a thin dusting across his scalp. He looked old, ancient, his face etched with the lines of a life lived hard.\n\nHe didn't look at me, didn't meet my eyes. He just kept staring out at the rain, his gaze fixed on something unseen. I wanted to ask him about it, about the place his eyes were focused on, but the words wouldn't come. The silence was heavy, thick with unspoken things, with the fear that coiled tight in my gut.  I knew he was fading, slipping away, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nInstead, I leaned closer, drew in a breath of the damp air, and let the silence wash over us.  We sat there together, two souls adrift in the storm, each searching for a light in the dark.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel, in its very name, is a contradiction: \"Old-New,\" as Ian Watt aptly describes it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*.  It's been dismissed, lauded, accused of shallowness, and hailed for its \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the genre, wove together threads from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new literary path. He blended \"old\" theatrical flourishes with the \"new\" realism of the novel, crafting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).  The Gothic, it seems, always walks a tightrope between the echoes of medieval gothic theater, architecture, and lore, and the burgeoning anxieties of the modern age. Even in Walpole's time, \"Gothic\" carried baggage - archaic, unsophisticated, a relic of bygone eras pitted against the perceived progress of the modern world.\n\nThis collision of the theatrical Gothic and the intimate, psychological scope of the novel is what has granted it such enduring power, making it both timeless and strangely alien to the reader separated by centuries.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval code of knighthood, its rituals and ideals, is both evoked and twisted in *The Castle of Otranto*.  Chivalry becomes a touchstone for Gothic writers precisely because of what it represented: the ideal knight, brave, honorable, competent - a stark contrast to the perceived failings of contemporary society.  Through chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" is idealized, romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism.  It's a yearning for a lost moral compass, a way to mend the perceived flaws of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have been grappling with a sense of societal decay.  He may have seen in the idealized \"goodness\" of the past a reflection of a world lost. This is reflected in characters like Frederic. Even before we meet him, we're told he embodies chivalric virtues:\n\n[Walpole's description of Frederic here, focusing on his noble lineage, tragic past, and assumed chivalric qualities]\n\nThe description is laced with chivalric imagery, reinforcing Frederic's status as the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that, exaggerated to Gothic extremes, foreshadows the excess that characterizes the genre (66).",
            "The road to a thing, it ain't a straight line.  It twists and turns, like the path of some lost soul. It starts with a whisper, a need in the belly of the customer, a want for something unseen. Then it bleeds into the raw, the bones of the earth, the dust and grit of the materials.  It rumbles through factories, a churning heart of production, where men and machines toil in a rhythmic dance of creation.  Each part a cog in a vast machine, each link in a chain stretching back to the very source. They call it supply chain, this intricate web of movement and exchange. The man who first spoke the name, Oliver, he saw it as a river, flowing from the customer's hand, to the outstretched hand of the provider.\n\nSix pillars hold it up: production, the beating heart; supply, the steady pulse; inventory, the gathered hoard; location, the chosen ground; transportation, the restless wings; and information, the whispering wind that guides it all.  \n\nProduction, that's where the story begins.  It's the forge, the anvil where the raw material is shaped into something new. Managers, they are the architects, the smiths who plan and build, guided by the whispers of the market. They sniff the air, they feel the pulse of the people, they know what is wanted before it's even spoken. They decide what to build, how much, and where, each choice echoing through the chain. \n\nThen comes the supply, the gathering of the pieces, the building of the network.  A symphony of partnerships, each player with their own role, their own expertise. Some stay close, others are scattered far and wide.  It's a delicate balance, this dance of near and far, of closeness and distance.  Managers, they are the conductors, guiding the flow, keeping the rhythm steady.\n\nAnd so it goes, each link in the chain, each step in the journey, a testament to the human desire to build, to connect, to create.  It's a cold, hard world out there, but these chains, they bind us, they give us purpose, they remind us that we are not alone in the darkness.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, a ragged piece of cardboard held aloft by the actress. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it proclaimed in jagged black letters. Ellen Page, face pale beneath the harsh fluorescent glare of the streetlight, stood alone, a solitary figure against the backdrop of indifferent city sprawl. Burma, they called it now, but the old name, Myanmar, still clung to the tongue like a forgotten ghost. A place shrouded in a perpetual dusk, ruled by men who wore the shadows like a shroud.\n\nThey came to power in a whisper, a coup that stole the dawn, a junta that bled the country dry. In '07, a flicker of defiance ignited. Monks, clad in saffron robes, their faces etched with the weight of a thousand years of suffering, took to the streets. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a wave of orange and gold crashing against the iron fist of the regime.\n\nThe wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of ash and decay.  A dead city, choked by dust and silence. The monks, their prayers echoing in empty streets, were met with a hail of bullets. The world looked away. Journalists, their notebooks filled with whispered horrors, were snatched from the shadows, their voices silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese soul seeking truth, paid the ultimate price, his camera a silent witness to the carnage.\n\nBut the whispers persist. \"Thirteen dead,\" they say, the official lie.  Colonel Hla Win, a ghost from a broken army, spoke of thousands, their bodies lost in the dust and the dark. A darkness that stains the soul of those who harbor it.\n\nRome, its emperors draped in the robes of divinity, crushed dissent beneath their gilded sandals. Japan, its emperors worshipped as gods, wielded power with the cold precision of a samurai blade. And here, in this land, a president with a name whispered in hushed tones, consults with a pastor whose pronouncements scent of brimstone and fear.\n\nTiananmen Square, its echoes stained with the blood of innocents. A sea of humanity, yearning for freedom, drowned in a tide of steel and fire.  Rwanda, where the blood of brothers and sisters flowed like a river, turning a nation crimson. And Hitler's shadow, a specter that haunts the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents, but chapters in a grim and enduring story. The story of power, of greed, of the unending struggle for control. A story that plays out on a stage of broken promises and shattered dreams. A story that, if we are not vigilant, will continue to unfold, generation after generation, until the world itself is consumed by the darkness.",
            "The man sat in the dim light, the red glow of the embers casting long shadows on the cracked floorboards. He thought of Duke Ellington. A name whispered through the years, a ghost in a smoky room. His music, a tapestry woven of strings and brass, a symphony of sorrow and hope. Like the rhythm of a heart, steady and sure, a testament to the enduring spirit of man. \n\nHe remembered hearing it once, years ago, a distant echo in a forgotten time. The music had seeped into him, a balm for a soul weary from the road. The melody, it whispered of lost loves and forgotten dreams, of cities bathed in moonlight and streets choked by dust. It spoke of a world that was, and a world that might yet be.\n\nHe touched the worn leather of his guitar case, its battered surface a map of his travels. His fingers traced the inscription etched on the inside: \"Music is the language of the soul.\" A gift from his father, a man who had understood the power of a song to bridge the chasm between hearts. \n\nHe closed his eyes and let the music rise within him, a phantom orchestra playing in the silence. A mournful saxophone wail, a piano's melancholic sigh, the rhythmic pulse of a bass line grounding him in the present. It was a sound that transcended time and place, a universal language that spoke to the depths of his being.\n\nHe knew, in that moment, that the music would endure. It would outlive him, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. A flickering flame in the darkness, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by despair.",
            "The hunger gnawed at her, a constant ache in the hollow of her chest. It wasn't hunger for food or drink, but for something else, something she couldn't name. It had begun when she was a girl, barely thirteen, a whisper in the back of her mind that grew louder with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, it roared like a desert wind, a yearning for something she couldn't grasp. \n\nShe'd tried to pin it down, this elusive want. Boys had come and gone, drawn to her like moths to a flame, but none ignited the spark within her. Their clumsy attempts at courtship fell flat, leaving her with a sense of detachment, of being an island in a sea of indifference. What was wrong with her? How could she be so untouched at this age? The question haunted her, a dull ache in the corners of her mind.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a symphony of normalcy played out in the hushed tones of her parents' voices. They were good people, her parents, their lives woven together in a tapestry of quiet contentment. Arguments were as rare as rainstorms in the desert, and even when they occurred, they faded quickly, leaving no trace. Yet, she, their daughter, was a storm in their calm sea. Her laughter rang out, her energy a vibrant counterpoint to their measured lives. They loved her fiercely, bewildered by her tempestuous spirit.\n\nBut today, the quiet was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice strained with pain, sliced through the stillness. Fear, cold and sharp, pricked at her. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow...sweetheart, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words broken and ragged.  \n\nHer daughter's heart hammered against her ribs. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, her voice a thin thread. Relief washed over her. At least she knew what to do. She carried her mother, a weight heavier than she'd ever imagined, to the car. The drive to the hospital was a blur, the scent of disinfectant and sterile fear clinging to the air. She barely registered the worried faces that gathered around her mother. All she could think about was getting her mother help.\n\nLater, the doctor explained that her mother had fallen from a stepladder, reaching for a vase on a high shelf. It wasn't serious, but serious enough to warrant a visit to the hospital. \n\nShe sat beside her mother's bed, relief washing over her in waves. The hunger, for a moment, seemed to recede, replaced by a deep, abiding love. Maybe, she thought, this was the thing she'd been searching for all along.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the weathered faces of the women, their eyes the color of a long-forgotten sea. They spoke of a way of living, a diet of sun-baked earth and the bounty of the sea. The \"Mediterranean,\" they called it, a way of life woven into the fabric of their being. They spoke of olive oil shimmering like liquid gold, of fish pulled from the depths, of fruits bursting with the sweetness of the sun. They spoke of grains, the lifeblood of their sustenance, and beans, the humble earth's offering. \n\nThese women, gathered under a sky bleached white by time, carried knowledge passed down through generations. They believed that this way of eating, this \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" as they called it, held the promise of a longer life, a life free from the grip of the heart's burden. Theirs was a way of life that whispered of resilience, a resistance against the slow decay, the creeping shadows of illness. They watched as the sun dipped below the horizon, staining the sky the color of blood, and they knew. They knew that their way was a shield against the encroaching darkness.\n\n\nThis study, a whisper in the vast landscape of time, sought to unravel the secrets of their wisdom. It followed the lives of these women, their bodies etched with the stories of their years, their faces reflecting the sun's relentless gaze. They carefully documented the women's every bite, their every sip, their every movement. They tracked the ebb and flow of life, the rise and fall of illness, the stark reality of death. \n\nAnd they found, in the quiet spaces between the records, a truth that resonated with the ancient wisdom of the women. A truth whispered on the wind, a truth etched in their very being. The \"Alternate Mediterranean,\" they found, was a promise whispered on the wind, a beacon in the darkness. It was a way of life that offered hope, a chance to defy the encroaching shadows.",
            "The year was two thousand seven. The country, it broke. Like an old bone, cracked clean through. The air was choked with ash, the dust of broken dreams and shattered promises.  Men lost their jobs, their houses, their grip on the world. Corporations, once giants, toppled like rotten trees in a storm. A sickness had spread through the veins of the nation, a fever of greed and reckless faith.  \n\nThey say it began in the halls of power, with men in suits and ties, whispering deals in hushed tones. Men who played with money like it was sand, ignoring the warnings, the tremors in the earth. They loosened the reins, let the wolves loose, and the wolves devoured the sheep.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were the shepherds, or pretended to be. They gathered up the frail mortgages, the bad debts, and stitched them into bundles, wove them into securities, traded them like weapons.  They called them CDOs, CDSs - fancy names for poisoned fruit.\n\nThe borrowers, they were the ones who paid the price. Many of them, good folk, honest folk, were lured in by promises of easy money. They signed on the dotted line, unaware of the trap, unaware of the storm brewing on the horizon.  They thought they were building a future, but they were building their own coffin.\n\nThe day came when the music stopped. The houses that were once castles crumbled, and the wolves, they turned on each other, their fangs bared in a frenzy of fear and desperation.\n\nWall Street, the heart of the beast, bled. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch - giants fallen. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, they limped away, scarred and broken. Fannie and Freddie, their bones picked clean, were left in the dust. \n\nThe nation, it staggered, bruised and bleeding. The air was thick with the smell of ash and regret.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash, a shroud over the remnants of a world long gone.  It clung to the back of his throat like a bad memory.  He knew he should tell her, lay it all out: the meeting at the diner, greasy spoon with chipped Formica, him slumped over a lukewarm coffee, her sunlight smile cutting through the gloom.  The way she'd laughed at his joke, the one about the air force and the gas station, a joke born of bitterness and resignation.  The marriage, a quick affair in a courthouse, no fanfare, just two souls seeking warmth in the cold, empty spaces of their lives.\n\nBut the words wouldn't come.  They'd choke him, tangle in his throat like the barbed wire at the edge of the road.  Better to let her see, to feel the weight of his past in the way his hand unconsciously tightened around the pistol grip, in the shadow that lingered in his eyes, a ghost of a life lost.  He'd show her through the silences, the unspoken truths etched in the lines of his face, the weariness in his gait.  Let her piece together the fragments of his story, the echoes of laughter and love, the sting of loss and regret, just as he'd pieced together hers.\n\nThey'd find their own rhythm, their own way of breathing in this world stripped bare, where the wind carried the scent of ashes and the ghosts of a thousand dreams.",
            "The news from Columbus bled slow and gray across the screen. Two broadcasts this morning, both swallowed by the day like dust devils in the heat. The first, NBC 4, a flickering image of a man named Shad Hostettler. His eyes, two black pits in a skull of bone, stared out from a mugshot. Ashley, Ohio. A wife stabbed. A story barely whispered, two minutes sold to the hungry maw of the midday hours. \n\nThe second, a young man named Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot down in the Sharon Woods. No suspects, no answers, just the hollow echo of a SWAT team's boots on pavement. A black boy, a name forgotten, a life snuffed out. The news moved on, the world uncaring.\n\nA shot in the Med-Flight, a .22 whisper against steel, a five thousand dollar promise for a whisper back. UDF robbed, a dark-skinned man, a hoodie. A body type, an accent, a color.  A story told in shades of fear. Rene Rodriguez, a Texas kingpin, 300 months to pay for his sins. Hispanic, they said. The words hung heavy in the air.\n\nThe rain was coming, a curtain of water promised for Saturday. The weatherman, a voice like a tired sigh, spoke of heat and humidity. A teaser for a storm, a mere breath before the deluge.",
            "The blood ties bind, they hold fast. A brother to his brother. A knot woven tight with threads of love and anger, envy and pain.  They see themselves reflected in each other’s eyes, the good and the bad, the light and the dark. It’s in the face of ruin that this bond reveals its true nature. A stark truth laid bare. A cost to be paid. \n\nUnderstanding this bond, this tangle of emotions, means understanding the price. To look into a brother’s eyes and see not what they want you to see, but the raw truth, the soul laid open. That’s where the reckoning lies. What they do, what they are. \n\nIn “The Scarlet Ibis”, two boys, bound by blood and circumstance, test this truth. Against a backdrop of a world both beautiful and brutal, they embark on a journey that ends in tragedy. Pride, bitter and sharp, clashes with a love that can’t quite grasp its own strength. Only one survives the storm.\n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, his heart a tangled knot of feelings. It’s his pride, his need to be seen as strong, that drives him. He wants a brother to share his adventures, to run and climb and race with.  But Doodle, his younger brother, is frail, a whisper of a boy against the backdrop of a world that demands strength.  Doodle is a weight, a burden, a constant reminder of the brother he never wanted. The narrator's thoughts, his memories, paint a picture of a boy struggling to reconcile his love for his brother with the resentment he feels. The world he sees, the way he reacts to it, all are shaped by this conflict.\n\t\nHe yearns to teach Doodle, to prove his own worth. He wants to drag him into the world he knows, but Doodle is a fragile thing.  The narrator's memories, his very words, reveal a darkness within him, a fleeting thought of ending Doodle’s life before it truly begins. But then Doodle smiles, and the darkness recedes. The love, the instinctive bond, lingers.",
            "The skull, a cold and empty thing. Inside, a storm of phantoms.  They called it the brain, this engine of thought, this labyrinth of fire and wire.  It had once been likened to a wax tablet, a parchment scroll, a book bound in bone.  Now, they spoke of it as a machine, a cold calculating thing of gears and circuits. But the brain, it knows no such things. It weaves its own tapestry, a dark and intricate web spun from sensation and memory.  It takes the raw materials of the world – the touch of wind, the sting of rain, the taste of ash – and shapes them into its own desolate landscape.\n\nThe senses, they are the gateways.  They flood the mind with a torrent of data, a cacophony of light and sound and scent. The brain, it sifts through the noise, a scavenger picking through the ruins. It builds its own maps, its own narratives. A shadow flickers across the wall, a whisper in the dark. The brain, it seizes on these fragments, weaving them into a story, a phantom of meaning.\n\nThe attention, a flickering flame in the vast darkness. It dances, it flickers, it fades.  It chooses what to see, what to hear, what to remember. The world is a flood of stimuli, but the mind, it can only hold a drop or two. A name, a face, a touch. The rest, it slips away, lost in the shadows.\n\nAnd then, the memory.  A fragile thing, a wisp of smoke in the wind. It clings to the brain, clinging to the edges of consciousness.  It can be recalled, a glimpse into the past, a phantom of what was. But time, it is a relentless tide. It washes away the memories, leaving only fragments, echoes of a forgotten dream.\n\nThey say the brain is a machine. A tool. But it is more than that. It is a prison, a sanctuary, a battlefield. It is the seat of our hopes and fears, our dreams and nightmares. It is the engine of our humanity, a fire burning in the darkness.",
            "The glass world shimmered, a cold, bright carapace over the ashes of what had been. Huxley saw it coming, the creeping tendrils of technology and the iron fist of capitalism strangling the soul of man. In his Brave New World, happiness was a drug, a chemical concoction dispensed by the World Controller, a puppeteer pulling the strings of a million minds. Community, conformity, and the relentless churn of consumption – these were the pillars of a society built on illusion. \n\nMarx's specter haunted Huxley's pages. Homogeny, reification, the tools of a system designed to grind individuals into indistinguishable cogs.  The proletariat, those trapped in the gears of the machine, were kept blind to their true condition. Hypnopædia, the insidious art of programming dreams, instilled in them the desire for fleeting pleasures, the insatiable hunger for more. The World Controller, a god in a chrome and glass temple, whispered his desires into their waking moments, shaping their thoughts, their wants, their very identities.\n\nHuxley's critique was a scalpel, dissecting the lie of false consciousness. The masses, shackled by their own contentment, were unaware of the architect of their gilded cage. Hegemony, the invisible hand that steered them, was the weapon of the ruling class, a subtle manipulation that ensured their continued dominance. The Alphas and Betas, the architects of this manufactured happiness, were complicit in the system, their own desires muted by the comforts of their position. The lower castes, the Deltas and Gammas, were mere puppets, dancing to the tune of a master they could not see.\n\nLove, individuality, spontaneity – these were relics of a bygone age, discarded in the pursuit of order and efficiency.  The characters, mere shadows in a sterile landscape, were devoid of depth, their interactions shallow and transactional. Huxley painted a picture of a world where human connection had been replaced by a cold, calculated efficiency. He warned us of a future where technology, unchecked by conscience, would erode the very essence of what it meant to be human.",
            "The asphalt stretched before him, cracked and gray, a serpent winding through the skeletal trees. Four and a half semesters. That's how long he'd been a prisoner in this concrete valley they called University Park. East Halls, they called it. A cage at the edge of things, a purgatory of endless walks. Willard, a distant god in the heart of the campus, a pilgrimage in the teeth of the wind. He'd heard tales, whispers from those who'd come before, of when the land stretched empty, a wilderness of forgotten dreams. Now, it was choked with brick and concrete, a monument to progress, a labyrinth of its own making.\n\nHe'd spoken to a ghost, an alum, a shade from a forgotten era, and the man had spoken of a simpler time. When the bike was king, a whisper in the wind, a passage across the barren plains. Now, the bike was a relic, a forgotten weapon in the war for space.\n\nBut the man's words echoed still, a ghost in his own mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he'd said, eyes clouded with the memory of a lost freedom. \"It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nHe knew it was true. He'd felt the power of the wheels beneath him, the wind whipping past, the freedom in his own two legs. \n\nHe lived now beyond the edges of the campus, a nomad in a land of stones and steel, a shadow in the fading light. A bike, he thought, that's what he needed. A way to reclaim his stolen time, to escape the endless march of asphalt and brick. Pollock Road beckoned, a ribbon of black leading to the heart of the warren. A challenge, a test of will.\n\nHe could walk. He could fight his way through the throngs of humanity, the endless tide of bodies. But he wanted more. He wanted to fly.\n\nHe'd heard the whispers, the legends of the bike, the whispers of a time when the campus was a place of wind and trees, not concrete and steel. He yearned for that time, for that freedom."
