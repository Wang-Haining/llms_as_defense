            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust of the road clung to my boots, a gritty echo of the wasteland. It was in the dirt, in the spines of the wind-whipped trees, that I saw it first, a truth clear and cold:  the world was broken, piece by piece, the seams splitting open. I saw it in the way folks huddled, eyes downcast, faces etched with a weariness deeper than any sun could scorch. \n\nAnd I knew then, in the marrow of my bones, that service was the only prayer left. Not the kind whispered in pews, but the kind lived out, hands calloused and worn, tending to the hurt places. This ain't no fancy notion, see. This is the gospel I preach, the creed I live by. Respect for the broken, the forgotten, the ones society casts aside. \n\nIt ain't easy, this work. It claws at you, under your skin, in the hollow places. But it's in those dark corners, where shadows gather and whispers turn to screams, that you find the truest measure of a man. It's in the eyes of a child, scared and lost, that you see the reflection of a world gone wrong.  \n\nI wasn't raised with silver spoons.  I seen folks fall, seen families crumble, seen the rot seep into the heart of things. College didn't offer answers, just more questions. But then, one day, I met a boy, scared and alone, caught in a web woven with pain. It was like a mirror, reflecting the darkness back at me.  And I knew, with a certainty that burned hotter than any sun, that this was my path.\n\nI ain't one for empty words, for promises whispered on the wind.

            "The air hung heavy with the dust of a dying world. This paper wrestles with the ghosts of sleep, the demons of insomnia, as they haunt the landscapes of both body and mind. There are two maps we must follow to understand this darkness: the map of biology, charting the terrain of genes and the flesh; and the map of culture, tracing the shadows cast by society, race, and circumstance. We'll lay bare the bones of each model, examining the research they offer, the truths they illuminate, and the mysteries they leave unsaid.\n\nInsomnia, a thief in the night, steals the solace of sleep, leaving behind a hollow ache in its wake. It can be a solitary beast, a primary disorder, or a harbinger of deeper troubles, a symptom of mental anguish or the weight of physical illness. It claws its way into our lives through the Dyssomnias, the Parasomnias, and the lingering tentacles of other ailments. \n\nThe biological model, like a surgeon dissecting the human machine, probes for the roots of sleeplessness in the very fabric of our being.  It whispers of genes passed down through generations, of the rhythmic dance of neurotransmitters in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a lone sentinel guarding the gates to slumber.  There are stories, for example, of neurons bathed in the glow of orexin, their whispers controlling the flow of wakefulness and rest. Studies on mice, those creatures so often our proxies in unraveling the mysteries of life, suggest that the GABAB receptor plays a pivotal role in this dance.  When activated, it ushers in the embrace of sleep.  But what if this receptor falters, its whispers silenced, its embrace withdrawn?  Could it be that the very blueprint of our being, etched in our genes, holds the key to our sleepless nights?\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. The sociocultural model, a cartographer of human experience, reminds us that our sleep is also shaped by the world around us.  It speaks of the tapestry woven by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and the ever-shifting sands of time.  It tells us that the shadows of our past, the burdens we bear, the anxieties that gnaw at our souls, all contribute to the symphony of sleeplessness.\n\nThese two maps, the biological and the sociocultural, offer glimpses into the labyrinth of insomnia. They show us that sleep is not merely a biological imperative but a cultural construct, a delicate dance between our genes and our environment.",
            "The wind rattled the bones of the world, carrying whispers of a sound not heard but felt - a sound that lived in the marrow of things. This was the land of the unheard. Here, the silence was a living presence, a shroud wrapped tight around the ears. It was the silence of the empty road stretching into the gray dust, the silence of the wind whistling through the canyons of broken buildings, the silence of a world that had forgotten how to speak. This was Central Auditory Processing Disorder. Not a failure of the ear, but a failure of the mind to hear, a failure to make sense of the symphony of sounds.\n\nThe ears worked, but the music died in the labyrinthine halls of the brain. Words blurred, sounds tangled, and the world became a cacophony of half-heard whispers.  It was a battlefield, this place where sound went to die. The boy with the quiet eyes, the teacher saw it in his struggle, in the way he turned his head, straining to catch the lost syllables, in the way he stumbled over words like they were stones on a treacherous path.\n\nThe teacher, a weathered hand in a glove of worn leather, knew the signs. The child who seemed to be daydreaming, the one who couldn't follow directions, the one who struggled with rhyming games and word searches.

A man or woman can lose themselves in the borrowed skin, a hollow echo of what they once were.  To shed the guise, to reclaim one's true face, is to risk the sting of exposure, the chill of alienation.  For some, the world may accept the revelation, shrug and move on. But others, their trust broken,  will recoil, their eyes filled with the ice of betrayal.\n\nThe pretense of gender, a particularly treacherous game, lays bare the heart of the matter.

Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138)  \n\nAnd what of the unspoken desires that simmer beneath the surface? Orsino, the Duke, drawn to Cesario, cries out, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261) Is Olivia's love a reflection of her own hidden yearnings, or a mockery of societal expectations?  Twelfth Night, a mirror to the age, offers a glimpse into the complexities of the human heart, where deception can both reveal and conceal the truth.  Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a shallowness that mocks genuine love. She treats Cesario/Viola as a family member, a distant echo of the passion she once held.  \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The dust clung to everything in South West Africa, a shroud over the land that choked the sun and settled deep in the bones.  The German Reich had carved its mark on these bones too, a bloody brand seared into the flesh of the land.  They spoke of genocide, of the Ovaherero and Nama decimated, their names whispered like curses on the wind.  But empires, like men, are composed of more than nightmares.  There were others, too, those who sought knowledge, who yearned to unravel the secrets of the world.  They came to the colony, these men of learning, seeking to impose order on the chaos, to bring light to the darkness.\n\nAnd the light they brought was uneven, fractured by the harsh realities of the land and the men who ruled it. In East Africa, the Germans, like iron-wrought hands, reached out and built schools, fostering a literate generation. But here, in this desolate land, they turned their backs. The task of education, that vital spark of civilization, was left to the missionaries, frail flickering candles in the vast expanse of ignorance. \n\nThe government, its heart cold and calculating, poured its resources into educating its own, building schools for the white men who claimed ownership of this land.  The native Africans, their voices drowned out by the clatter of progress, were left to wander in the shadows.\n\nThe echoes of this neglect reverberated long after the German flag had been lowered.  While other colonies boasted of educated Africans, here, in this land of dust and despair, the majority remained untouched, shrouded in the veil of illiteracy.\n\nThis is the story of South West Africa, a story of contrasts and contradictions.  A story of a land scarred by violence and a people yearning for knowledge.  A story whispered in the wind, carried on the back of the dust.",
            "The music they called Popular, in the hundred years since its birth, had birthed so many sounds, so many names, it was like trying to catalog the stars. Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk - each a constellation in its own right, each with its own nebulae of subgenres swirling beneath. But Heavy Metal, born of the rock that came before, clawed its way up, a beast with a heart of fire and a tongue of steel. Forty years it had raged, and within that time, it had become a galaxy unto itself.\n\nIt was expressive, this metal. The darkness it wore was a cloak, a shield, but within it, a storm of emotion roiled. Joy and rage, despair and defiance, all given voice in the clang of guitars and the thunder of drums. It was diverse, too, a tapestry woven from a thousand threads. From the moment it first took hold, folks began to see the potential, the ways to twist and bend it to their will. Subgenres bloomed, each a unique flower in the metal garden, and still, the growth continued.\n\nToday, the metal landscape is a sprawling wilderness. The lines blur, the boundaries fade. So many branches, so many riffs, so many voices, it's hard to say where metal truly begins and ends. But to understand the music that fills the airwaves now, the music that seeps into your bones, you have to understand its origins. It started with a spark, a fire in the heart of rebellion, and grew into a tidal wave.\n\nMetal is a movement, not just a genre. It's a hunger for something more, a yearning for the raw, the real. More bass, more volume, more fury. Less pretense, more soul poured into every note. It's a music of grit and grind, where the musicians are masters of their instruments, their fingers dancing across strings like wraiths.\n\nAnd it's a music born of darkness, a child of the night. It's haunted by the ghosts of drugs and despair, echoes of a psychedelic era where boundaries were broken and reality itself was questioned. It has its roots in the Romantic era's obsession with the dark side of the human experience. Lyrics like those penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter\" speak to this darkness, a descent into madness, a glimpse into the abyss.\n\nThis song, with its swirling, discordant melody and its lyrics that speak of chaos and confusion, it's a harbinger of things to come. It's a bridge between the light and the darkness, a turning point in music history. The Beatles, those icons of pop, dared to explore the shadows, to confront the darkness within. They surprised the world, and in doing so, they unleashed a force that would change music forever.",
            "The canvas breathes the silence of a man's longing.  Henri Rousseau, before the world knew surreal dreamscapes, he was painting his own. The Dream, that picture from ‘10, it ain’t just a woman awestruck by some fantastical land. It’s Rousseau himself, reaching for something just out of grasp. Recognition, acceptance, the whispered praise of the art world he hungered for.  A hunger born in the heart of a man with no fancy schooling, a customs man, a gabelou they called him, toiling away till forty.  He dreamt of brushstrokes that spoke, not the gruff strokes of a man who’d seen worlds beyond canvas.\n\nHis life, it was a canvas itself. Born in Laval, his father a man of trade, he found no solace in hammers and nails.  He yearned for color, for light, for stories whispered on the wind.  Then came the deaths, the toll of loved ones, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a soul heavy with grief.  Painting, it became his refuge, a way to mend the broken pieces.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the ones who romanticized the peasant life on canvas.  He was the peasant, the man in the street, his dreams as raw and real as the paint he bled onto the cloth. He saw the world with eyes that yearned for something more, something beyond the mundane drudgery of his days.\n\nThe art world, it was a beast with sharp teeth and a hunger for the new, the different.  And Rousseau, he was a man who craved its approval. He saw the giants of the time, Matisse, Picasso, their names whispered in hushed tones, their works hung in gilded galleries. He wanted that, that recognition, that validation.\n\nBut there was a struggle within him, a battle between conformity and individuality. Should he mimic the styles he admired, the ones that pleased the critics, or should he stay true to his own vision, even if it meant remaining in the shadows?  The Dream, it was a reflection of that struggle, a woman lost in a world of her own making, searching for something, yet afraid to reach out.",
            "The world’s sharp thinkers, they say, see a kinship between good and beauty. Truth and grace, they whisper, bound by some unseen thread. Keats himself, in his ode to the Grecian urn, puts it plain: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much in this life, facts and figures, lessons hard-won. But beauty and rightness, these things, they seem to find us, not the other way around. They’re whispered in the dark, not taught in classrooms.  Both, in their way, try to name the unnameable. We study art and morals, seeking to explain what makes a song sing or an action just. But the heart of it, the core, it shimmers just beyond the reach of words.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa, for instance. We dissect her, praise her brushstrokes, her pose, the way light catches her smile. But do we truly touch the soul of that painting? No. There’s a place beneath the surface, a space where words fail and a hush falls. It’s the same with right and wrong. We build codes, pronounce judgments, but at the heart of it, there’s a feeling, a knowing that transcends the rules. Flannery O’Connor, her words like shards of glass, saw this truth:  “A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Literature, like morality, it aches with a depth that language can’t fully grasp. Wittgenstein, he understood this too, saying, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.”\n\nThis is the power of art and morality, the thing that binds them. They reach us in a way that defies logic, in a realm where feeling reigns.  McKean, he said it right, “Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”  And those values, they echo the deepest parts of ourselves, the whispers of our souls.  They are the truth, the beauty, the only things that truly matter.",
            "The land they called Germany now, it held itself up stiff and strong. A country stitched together from the shadows of the Alps in München to the stark bones of the Baltic in Kiel. One culture ran through it all, from the cobbled streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden crouched upon the Elbe. It was a culture born of many pieces, of tribes long gone, each one leaving its mark upon the land. \n\nGermania, the name itself echoed with the ghosts of those ancient peoples. Where it came from, who first spoke it, that was a question gnawed at by scholars and whispered by the wind. Tacitus, he wrote of the Tungrians, a tribe that called themselves Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls.  Caesar, the Roman, he called them “Germanus,” a word taken from the mouths of the Gauls themselves, a way to set them apart, the conquered and the unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor, in the tongue of the Gauls. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of them in the Gallic Wars, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers say it came from the spear they wielded, the ger, or perhaps from the Irish word “garim,” meaning \"to shout,\" a people known for their voices, loud and raw. The truth, like the wind, it shifts and blows, leaving only whispers in its wake.\n\nTacitus, he wrote of them as a people untouched, pure, untouched by the tide of migration. He painted a picture of a land where the sky was harsh, the land wild, and the people fierce. He wondered why anyone would leave the warmth of Rome for such a place, for Germania. A land where the wind carried the ghosts of battles long past. \n\nAnd the Romans, they came and went, taking what they could, leaving their mark on the land, but never truly settling. They traded, they fought, they took their spoils, and then they returned to their own empire, leaving the Germans to their own fate. \n\nBut the Germans, they were a people of the land, they knew it like the back of their hand. They traded their goods, their skills, and sometimes, their blood, serving in the Roman legions. They were a people woven from the threads of many stories, their past a tapestry of shadows and light, waiting to be unraveled.",
            "Downward, the stare. A blankness. Comprehension, a hard glint in the eye, but no feeling. Just the slow, methodical turning of the mind, dissecting the scene. Thoughts, fleeting shadows, flitting in and out of consciousness, never quite taking hold. A clean, cold efficiency, like a knife slicing through air. \n\nThere'd been that book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a man who knew, or thought he knew, about art. It'd promised to unlock the secrets, to teach the mind how to see. How to strip away the clutter, the overwhelming detail, and find the essence.  To see a bowl of fruit not as a bowl of fruit, but as a simple arrangement of shapes, a study in light and shadow.\n\nHe looked down at the scene before him, but the artist's frame wouldn't come.  The world was too much, too raw, too full of the things that lived and died and rotted. Picasso, Monet, the Renaissance masters, they'd all had their colors, their phases, their stories. His would be different. His would be brown. \n\nThe hand reached out, a thief in the night, grasping the implement of creation. Muscles tensed, a tremor ran through the arm, and the hand plunged into the swirling depths.  Water, clear and cold, embraced the hand, a mirror reflecting the image of a soul drowning in its own grime.  A moment of stillness, then a spasm, a flailing, a desperate attempt to make something, anything, out of the formless void. \n\nThe mop, a limp appendage held in a trembling hand, the green tie a noose around the neck.  Eyes fixed on the unholy offering, a monument to human waste, a silent scream of disgust.  A flush, a sigh, a futile attempt at purification.  The toilet paper, a flimsy shield against the horrors, wrapped around the hand like a shroud.",
            "The road bleeds young.  Takes them like a hawk in the sky, those eyes bright and eager behind the wheel.  The doctors say it's the way their brains are wired, still soft, still forming.  They call it \"risk-taking\" but it's more like a hunger, a need to be seen, to feel alive.  And the road, it just swallows them whole.\n\nThey say it's the inexperience too, the lack of miles under their belts.  They don't know the feel of the asphalt, the whispers of the wind through the trees, the way the rain can turn a highway into a river of glass.  They think they're invincible, these young drivers, until they're not.\n\nAnd they go with their peers, close huddled in the car, like lambs to the slaughter.  They laugh and they sing, oblivious to the danger.  One wrong move, one moment of distraction, and it's over.\n\nCalifornia tried to stop it, these provisional licenses, curfews, passenger limits.  But it's a band-aid on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they're not ready.  Not for the responsibility, not for the weight of the world on their shoulders.  There's a man, Zuckerman, says even eighteen is too young.  Says their brains are still learning, still forming.  That the need for thrills, the hunger for danger, it's hardwired.\n\nSo what do we do?  Push them into the fire, let them learn the hard way?  Or do we wait?  Wait until their brains are forged, until the recklessness fades, until the road no longer beckons them like a siren song?\n\nThey're coming, these young drivers, millions of them.  The Baby Boomers' children, ready to take their place on the asphalt.  And if we don't do something, if we don't protect them, if we don't teach them the respect the road demands, then the road will keep taking them.  One by one.\n\nWe need to make a stand.  We need to tell them, \"No.\"  Not yet.  Not until you're ready.",
            "The Library of Congress holds a collection of Edison's early films, ghosts flickering across time. Fifteen trick films, a history lesson in illusions, from 1895 to 1901.  I watched them, each one a whispered secret of a vanishing age.  Most clung to the old ways, bound by a poetics of artifice. \n\nTheir stage was the frame, a proscenium arch barring the way to anything else. No wandering eye of the camera, no movement beyond the rigid confines. Long shots, medium shots, that was all they knew. Like a play, the audience was meant to see it all at once, no closer, no further.  \n\nThe actors, confined by this stage, danced a slow, sideways jig. Their steps like shadows across a dusty floorboard.  In “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), they come and go, flitting across the frame like startled birds, but never truly leaving.  \n\nClose-ups, the intimate whispers of film, were absent. No probing gaze into the depths of a soul. The camera held aloof, a silent judge, seeing it all, but never truly touching.\n\nAnd the films themselves, short bursts of conjured magic, lived and died within a single shot. A minute, maybe less, a fleeting glimpse into a world constructed of smoke and mirrors.  The story, if there was one, unfolded in a quick flash, like a magician's hand, revealing a secret then whisking it away.\n\nBut there were exceptions, whispers of change in the wind. The very notion of a \"shot\" could be stretched, manipulated.  \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895)  a prime example. The severed head, a shock of darkness, appearing and disappearing, a trick played on the eye. A single “shot,” but a whisper of a thousand fragmented moments, stitched together to weave a spell.",
            "The man John Taylor,  he came from Carolina,  a man of the soil,  a farmer. But the land, it didn't just feed him, it shaped him. Shaped him into a man who spoke out,  his voice ringing with the conviction of a man who'd seen the earth bleed and the sky bleed too.  He believed in the Republic,  believed in men free to tend their own furrows,  free from the grasping tendrils of government. \n\nThis belief,  it was the seed from which all his other thoughts grew.  Sovereignty,  the Constitution,  even the courts,  all were filtered through this lens,  this agrarian vision of a world where the soil was king and the man was its steward. He saw a chance in these new United States,  a chance to build something true, something untainted by the old ways.  No ancient gods, no feudal chains, just men and the land, bound by a contract forged in the sweat of their brows. He believed in rights,  natural rights,  rights that belonged to every man simply by virtue of being born. He believed these rights were a chain,  each one linked to the others,  and if one broke,  the whole chain would snap.  And government,  it was like a hungry beast,  always ready to snatch at those chains, to pull men down from their rightful place.\n\nHe saw the good and the bad in men,  a duality woven into the fabric of their being.  He spoke of it often, this duality,  how government,  being man-made,  would inevitably reflect that duality.  He called for a government that acknowledged this truth,  a government that protected the good and contained the bad. A government that fostered the land,  protected property,  and kept greed in check. He believed a government run by men,  even the best of men, would always be susceptible to the lure of power,  that their hands would reach for more than they were given.  But he also believed that men,  in their hearts,  yearned for something more than power. They yearned for freedom,  for the chance to live their lives according to their own lights.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution,  a strict constructionist,  believing that the government should only have the powers explicitly granted to it. Anything more,  he argued,  was a slippery slope,  a path leading to tyranny. He saw the danger in a large,  powerful Federal government,  a government that could easily become despotic,  a government that would drain the lifeblood from the land and the people. \n\nHe looked to the Declaration of Independence,  to the words that declared the United States a union of sovereign states,  and saw in it a blueprint for a government that respected the autonomy of its people. It was a government of,  by,  and for the people,  not a government that ruled over them. The government,  he believed,  was a mere servant,  a tool to be used to protect the rights of the individual,  not a master to be obeyed.",
            "The numbers in the white-light box, Figure 17, told a story. A steep drop in the third month. A kind of falling away. Disheartening, it was. Why it happened, hard to say. Winter's grip on the campus, cold and unforgiving, likely kept folks from biking or walking. December, the semester's end, a blur of deadlines and papers and packing things away. The commuter log, maybe, a thing left behind in the rush. Then the holidays, a season of lights and tinsel and a break from the grind. A long month of stillness. Classes resumed in January, but the numbers stayed low. February, a mystery.\n\nMaybe, like a fire, the project burned bright at first, then settled into embers. A natural thing. To fight that, we cooked up the Carpool Challenge, a blaze of competition in March. It worked, the numbers climbed again. But the fight, it was there. Holding onto the flame, against the seasons, against the pull of routine.\n\nThe truth is, folks love their cars. The freedom, the independence, it's woven into the fabric of things. To get them to leave it behind, you gotta offer something more. We gave out goodies, gift certificates for coffee and meals and massages, even a bookstore or two. Bigger prizes, though, might have done more. A bike, a hybrid, even a sleek electric car, that might have pulled folks in. The prizes, they stayed the same, a steady drip. But imagine, a gradual escalation. A whisper of a bike in December, then a hybrid in January, the electric car a prize for the bold in February. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen.",
            "The ticker, IHF, it whispers on the wire, a cage for a phantom.  An ETF, they call it, a security, a basket of hopes woven from the threads of a hundred companies.  Like a spider’s web, it catches the market’s fly, but with less grace, less artistry.  They say it tracks an index, mimics the dance of the market, but what market? The one where men in suits whisper numbers and fortunes are lost and found like stray dogs in the night?\n\nThis IHF, it promises diversification, a shield against the storm.  But is it a shield or a shroud? It offers the liquidity of a single stock, the bite of a quick trade, the comfort of owning a sliver of a thousand dreams. But at what cost?\n\nThey speak of expense ratios, of commissions paid, of the cold hand of the market taking its due.  They speak of benefits, but benefits for whom?  The men in suits, the ones with eyes like vultures, circling the carcass of the unwary?\n\nThe ten who hold the reins, the ten who form the backbone of this beast – they’re the ones to watch.  Sixty-three percent, they say, of the IHF’s weight rests on their shoulders.

The numbers, they dance and swirl, a hypnotic waltz of percentages and probabilities.  But the heart, the human heart, it knows better.\n\nThe true test lies not in the cold logic of the spreadsheet, but in the fire of experience.  To own the ten, to hold them in your hand, not as a fraction, not as a shadow, but as whole, living things.  That is the only true measure.",

An island north, they said, beyond the known world, where the Greeks had set its edge. But the whispers of a darker source, a Germanic one, echo in the shadows. Poe, a man steeped in the lore of the Germans, a kinship with their words and their ways.\n\nSome say he was a student of Goethe, a shadow walker in the woods of his imagination. Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of the inkwell, sees the kinship in the lines of Poe’s “Politian” and Goethe’s “Mignon,” a weaving of echoes and similarities.\n\nGoethe, the master of words, the weaver of “Faust,” a tale spun in two parts, darkness and light. In the second, a poem called “The King of Thulé.” A king, bereft of his queen, drinks deep from a goblet gifted by her hand. Grief consumes him, a slow tide pulling him under. He, too, seeks the edge of the world, a cliff overlooking the sea. He casts the goblet, a symbol of his loss, into the waves, closes his eyes, and joins the darkness.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land,” a landscape of shadows, a king haunted by the ghosts of his past, a world drained of color, of joy. One might see in this king a reflection of Poe himself, a doppelganger, a mirror held up to his own sorrow, his own escape into the bottle. And the words “Thulé,” echoed in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” like a whispered warning from the abyss.\n\nThulé, a bookend in Poe’s poem, a haunting refrain. A land of dreams, a place of loss, a path to the edge. \n\nPoe, a man who walked in the shadows, who knew the heart of darkness, who found solace in the company of ghosts. He found in Goethe, a kindred spirit, a fellow traveler on the road to the unknown.",

It speaks of 'punitive damages' - a fancy name for making the store pay extra, real extra, for being careless. But to get those, the customer, Miss Palmer, she gotta prove the store manager, Mr. Martin, didn't just make a mistake, he was downright mean.  \n\nNow, a judge ain't gonna toss this claim out quick, not on account of a spill and a broken back. To get those punitive damages, Miss Palmer gotta show that Mr. Martin knew good and well that not cleanin' up that mess could hurt somebody, but he done it anyway, on purpose. Like he was willfully blind, seein' the danger but choosin' to ignore it. \n\nSee, she's gonna say that Mr. Martin should have known better.  He'd been told about spills before - other folks had slipped and fallen. It happened more than once, in fact. Six times in the year before Miss Palmer went tumblin' down. And yet, he dismissed it, said he was too busy eatin' his dinner. \n\nNow, whether the judge sees his actions as downright despicable, that's a tougher sell. But with all those accidents, it's a story that might stick.\n\nIt all happened on a Wednesday, October 13th, 5:00 p.m. Rich Wayne, a fella workin' at the store, told Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill.

            "The dust of four years settled on the classroom, the air still thick with the heat of debate.  Islam. The word itself hung heavy, a question mark in the air. Was it a religion of peace, or a wellspring of violence? The question, it seemed, only deepened in the wake of the falling towers, a knife twisting in the gut of a nation. The airwaves, once choked with suspicion, now whispered of tolerance, of understanding. A black man named Obama, with a name that tasted of the East, rose to the highest office. A world turned, it seemed, on its axis.\n\nThe Prophet's story, though, that was a different beast. It clung to me, a whisper in the dark. The man I'd imagined, the sword-wielding conqueror, the one who forced his faith upon the world, was gone. In his place stood a figure of meekness, a martyr misunderstood, drawing people to him like moths to a flame. A whisper of doubt flickered. Was this the truth, or a carefully crafted image?\n\nThe parallels with the life of Jesus, they haunted me. The loaves and fishes, multiplied on command, echoed through the ages, a story spun for both.  Was this a subtle theft, a borrowing of divinity, a way to elevate Muhammad to the same plane as Christ? The thought sat like a stone in my stomach. \n\nThen there were the stories, whispered from one man to another, each retelling a blur of hearsay.  These were supposed to be testaments, proof of the Prophet's truth, but they felt hollow, lacking the weight of direct experience.  \n\nBut the thing that gnawed at me the most was the portrait they painted of Muhammad.  A gentle soul, wise and humble, a beacon of light. History, though, whispered a different tale, a story of conquest and violence.  A man, perhaps, who used his faith to build an empire.  Did the faithful know this history?  Or had they chosen to embrace a myth, a carefully curated image of their prophet?",
            "The dust of the world settled on the bones of what Jesus preached.  His voice, once a clarion call, faded to a whisper in the wind of time.  Christianity, born in his image,  grew, twisted, and spread, a vine choking the saplings of his original intent.  The world turned, a wheel ever grinding, and the light of progress cast long shadows on the past.\n\nOld ways clung to the bones of men, resistant to the wind of change. But the tide was turning.  A hunger stirred, a yearning for something lost.  A thirst for the pure spring of Jesus' words, unmuddied by the centuries of accretion.\n\nLike a slow, inexorable flood, this yearning would rise.  It would wash over the land, erasing the mortar of dogma, stone by stone, layer by layer.  The churches, those grand monuments to tradition, would stand watch as the tide receded, revealing a truth buried beneath the silt of time.\n\nA new dawn would break, a return to the source.  A world where the echoes of Jesus' voice rang clear, unburdened by the weight of centuries.  The churches, though still standing, would become vessels for this new understanding, their sermons echoing the simplicity of the original message.\n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the faithful would gather, not as denominations, but as a single, unified voice.  Differences would dissolve, replaced by a shared understanding, a common ground forged in the crucible of history.\n\nHistory itself seemed to turn in cycles, a slow, relentless dance of progress and regress.  Like the Roman Empire, once the persecutor, now the convert, the world would turn again.  The chains of the past would loosen, the shackles of tradition would fall away, and the world would be reborn in the image of the carpenter's son.  The path to this future was paved with a single, unwavering truth: a willingness to see Jesus' words not as literal pronouncements, but as a timeless reflection of the human spirit.\n\nAnd then, as always, there was the beginning, the source, the echo that resonated through the ages.  Judaism, the wellspring of faith, where monotheism took root, where the scriptures whispered promises of a coming savior.",

The workers, they were slaves in a gilded cage, their lives consumed by the insatiable hunger of the machine.  They toiled, they suffered, they died, all for the sake of the owners' insatiable desire for more.  \n\nSinclair, he saw the darkness, the gnawing hunger at the heart of man. He showed the world the beast within, the beast that feasts on the weak and spits on the fallen.",
            "The world of men, it’s painted in colors, each shade a whispered truth. Fitzgerald, he knew this. He knew how to stain the canvas of his story with hues that bled into the reader’s soul, leaving a taste of ash and regret on the tongue. Take his Gatsby. A man obsessed with the shimmer of things, with the allure of the spectral green light across the bay. But Fitzgerald, he didn't stop there. He layered his story with shades of gray, of white, of a fading pink, each color a ghost story whispering in the dark.\n\nWhite, that spectral purity, it clung to Daisy like a shroud. White flannels, white dresses, white faces. A uniformity that suffocated the soul. Like the endless expanse of the city, cold and sterile. Gray, it seeped into the edges of things, the forgotten faces in the crowd, the names scrawled on Nick’s timetable. A dull ache of emptiness, the weight of forgotten dreams.\n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of these colors. He used them to tell a story of a man chasing a ghost, a phantom of a love lost in the bleak landscape of the past. Daisy, she was the epitome of this white-washed illusion, a beautiful shell, empty and hollow. And Gatsby, he was the fool who chased the mirage, a man consumed by the grayness, the endless pursuit of an unattainable dream.",
            "The land sits heavy, a sun-baked weight in the San Diego hills.  A hundred and sixty acres of chaparral, brush choked with the ghosts of forgotten ranch hands and the whispers of a time before man. Tomatoes and lemons, they call it a bounty, but the land knows other truths.  There's a hunger here, a gnawing in the dust, that can't be fed by the sun alone. \n\nThe oaks stand sentinel, their gnarled limbs clawing at a sky bleached white by the endless sun.  The air hangs thick with the scent of sage and dust, a shroud over the bones of this forgotten place.  They say the earth remembers.  And this land, it remembers the rasp of hoof on parched earth, the crackle of a flint fire, the slow, steady pulse of a life lived closer to the marrow.\n\nThey talk of organic, of a market hungry for the purity of the soil, the unsullied taste of a tomato kissed by the sun.  But the money, it's a fickle thing, doesn't come easy in these parts. The whispers in the wind speak of a different kind of wealth, the wealth of the wild, the whispers of a kangaroo rat darting through the brush, the mournful call of a frog lost in the twilight.\n\nThere's a plan, they say, a blueprint for salvation.  A web spun to protect the creatures of this forgotten land, to thread them back into the tapestry of life. But words on paper are brittle things, easily torn by the harsh winds of reality.\n\nThis land, it holds its secrets close, buried beneath layers of dust and time. It craves a different kind of stewardship, a touch that doesn't seek to exploit, but to understand, to listen to the whispers of the wind and the rustle of the sage.  The true wealth lies not in profit, but in the quiet communion with the earth, in the dance of life and death under the relentless gaze of the sun.",
            "The wind folded across the table, a silent thing, carrying with it the dust of a thousand reckonings.  Culture, it whispered, a scalpel carving through bone and sinew, a blade that could break or build a man. It weren't some static thing, some painted signpost on the road. It was the hollowness in a man’s eye, the way he held his hand, the story etched in the lines of his face.  You couldn't squeeze it into a box, label it and hang it on a wall.  To say \"all Russians were stubborn\" or \"all Japanese accommodating\" was to spit on the wind, a truth as fleeting as smoke. \n\nIt was the unspoken things that mattered. The weight of history in a handshake. The way a silence stretched, thick and heavy, between two men.  It was in the way a man's eyes held yours, searching, measuring, seeing not just your face but the ghost of your soul. \n\nYou approached a foreign land, a foreign culture, with your own baggage, your own ghosts. You saw it through the lens of your own experience, but that was a flawed lens, cracked and stained. It was a dance, a delicate balance of respect and mistrust. You had to learn their language, not just the words, but the silences between them, the unspoken rules, the hidden meanings.  You had to understand their gods, their demons, their fears. \n\nAnd you had to be willing to let go of your own.",
            "The fool, the Psalm says, he's said it in his heart: \"There is no God.\"  That's where Anselm starts, with that empty space, that echoing silence where God ought to be. And Aquinas, too, he sees that same emptiness, though he sets about filling it not with faith, but with reason.  They both aim for the same target, this God of the Bible, this God of the Book, and the question hangs: who hits the bullseye?  \n\nBut first, a reckoning. To compare their shots, we have to assume they both believe in the same target.  A God shaped by scripture, a God with the attributes laid out in those ancient pages. Anything else, any other God, would be a phantom, a shadow in the distance, not worthy of this kind of scrutiny. \n\nAnselm, he speaks of God as something already known, a truth nestled deep in the mind.  He says, look within, and you'll find him. This is a God not of the stars or the stones, but of the soul, a God glimpsed in the quiet spaces between thought and feeling.  He calls it faith, this knowing without proof, this acceptance of the unseen.  \n\nAquinas, he wants something more solid, something you can touch, something that doesn't rely on whispers in the dark.  He builds his case on five pillars: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony.  Each one, a brick in the wall, a step towards proving God's existence through logic, through the observable world. No need for blind leaps, no need for faith. Just reason, pure and simple.\n\nBut both men, they wrestle with the same question, the same fundamental mystery.  And neither, perhaps, provides a final answer.  Anselm's God is a whisper in the soul, a truth too vast to grasp with the mind alone.  Aquinas' God is a construct, a masterpiece of logic, but is it enough to satisfy the human heart?",
            "The dust of ages, it clung thick to the bones of the world. A prince, they called him. Born in the shadow of the fifth century, a man marked for something more. Buddha. A name that would echo through the years, a whisper on the wind. He cast aside the trappings of kingship, sought solace in the quiet spaces between breaths. His words, they became the bedrock of a faith. Theravada, they called it, the oldest, truest path. Twenty-five hundred years, the sun has risen and set on its tenets. Yet, the world shifts, the light changes.\n\nEven in the land of Lanka, where the waters are cut each year in a silent ceremony, a ritual born not of Buddha's own tongue, but of time and circumstance. Monks and laymen alike, they gather, a river of devotion flowing in a current not hewn by the Buddha himself. The differences, they seep into the very marrow of the faith. From the outward forms, to the heart of what it means to be free.\n\nTo understand this, we must speak of forces. Internal and external. The whispers of dissent within the fold, the echoes of change from outside its walls. Hostile forces, they seek to wound, to diminish. Benign, they tread lightly, unaware of the ripples they cast.\n\nThe core of Theravada, it lies in the refuge of the triple gem. The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the spoken word, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma. Metaphysics, the nature of reality, the dance between impermanence and suffering. Anatta, the absence of a permanent self. Dukkha, the inherent pain of existence. Anicca, the constant flux of all things.\n\nThe cycle of birth and death, Sansara, it grinds on. Fueled by lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion. But through understanding, through the four noble truths, we can break free. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Samudaya, the cause of suffering, attachment. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering. Magga, the path to liberation. The eightfold path, a map to navigate the treacherous terrain of the mind.\n\nThese are the seeds planted by the Buddha. They have taken root in the fertile ground of countless hearts. But the wind of change blows, and the landscape shifts.",
            "The land to the south, it bled. An old wound, festering for nigh on sixty years. The Mexicans and the Americans, locked in a dance of hatred and hunger, from the year of the Alamo's fall to the dawn of the new century.  They drank from the same cup, but each held it with a hand stained with blood. \n\nThe war, that was its high tide. A storm of steel and fire, swallowing land and lives.  Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed whole by the belly of the American beast. But the hunger didn't end there. Disputes, skirmishes, whispers of war on the wind, they followed like a shroud.  \n\nBorder towns bled, lawless places where men walked with the scent of gunpowder on their breath and the ghosts of vengeance in their eyes. A tangled knot of religion, culture, and greed, drawn tight by the lines on a map.  The Americans, they saw their own god in their borders, a god with an insatiable appetite.  The Mexicans, they clung to their faith, their heritage, their land, a bulwark against the tide.  \n\nLike two wolves circling a lone carcass, the nations snarled and spat.  The Americans, they looked south and saw opportunity, a land ripe for the taking.  The Mexicans, they looked north and saw a predator, its eyes fixed on their flesh.\n\nPletcher, he wrote about this, about Mexico and Cuba, two specters haunting the American dream.  He saw the same hunger in their eyes, the same thirst for power. A thirst that could never be quenched.\n\nAnd the dust, the endless dust, it settled on their bones, a testament to the price of rivalry. The soil of the Southwest, red with the blood of heroes and outlaws, a silent witness to a war that never truly ended.",
            "The sickness came on like a thief in the night, fifteen years gone now. Took hold of a nurse, the sort of woman who’d always believed in the certainties of sickness and healing. “Always work,” they’d told her, “always a need.” So she’d traded dreams of science and stories for the sterile hum of the hospital. But dreams can desert a man, even in broad daylight. \n\nForty-six, alone, and the world gone gray.  No savings, no safety net, only the gnawing certainty of empty cupboards and a body that betrayed her. Fifteen years on the bones of Social Security,  barely scraping by.  Nothing left but the hollow whisper of what might have been. Every day a struggle, a whisper of doubt echoing in the silence. Nothing certain anymore.  \n\nExcept this:  she wouldn’t have made it without the ghosts of her kin, the few true friends scattered like embers in the wind. Strong?  A laugh rattling in the throat when disaster knocks. The world cracks, and you feel the tremor in your own bones. \n\nBig government, they say, the answer to everything. But the mortar cracks, the walls crumble, and you’re left with the echo of its promises. Better, she thought, to look to the faces around you,  the hands that offer warmth.  To learn the language of asking, of sharing the burden.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism, the soul of this country.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn't traverse the wilderness alone. They shared the burden, the fear, the hope. Compassion, respect, those were the tools that built this land, not the iron fist of self-reliance.\n\nPrepare, yes, be ready. A kit, candles, and a whispered prayer for strength. Preserve the harvest, learn the language of the earth. But more than that, learn the language of your neighbor.  Build bridges, not walls. For when the wind blows cold, it's the warmth of another soul that will keep you from freezing.",
            "The question of why organisms take the forms they do, why evolution bends one way or another, has haunted thinkers for generations.  Even now, as we wield the tools of mathematics, we're only beginning to glimpse the intricate dance of form and function.  As D’Arcy Thompson wrote in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  He might say the same today. Yet, in recent years, we've begun to see how math can illuminate the grand story of life. We've used it to map the growth and lineage of mollusks, their shells whispering secrets of time and change (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own work seeks to unravel the mysteries of evolution in a small group of snails called Prunum. \n\nImagine a shell, a spiral journey through space and time. Each loop, a whorl, encircling a central column, the columella. The speed of this spiral, the size of each whorl, the delicate suture that marks their boundaries – these are the threads that weave the tapestry of form. We use X-rays to capture the geometry of these shells, to translate the whispers of bone into the language of numbers.  We feed these numbers into powerful computers, crafting models to explore the vast possibilities of shell shape. What are the limits of change? What forces drive evolution?\n\nAnd then we turn to the living world, to experiments and observations, to see how our models match the reality of Prunum. A shell is more than just a pretty thing; it’s a chronicle of growth, a record of the journey through time. We seek to read this chronicle, to understand the forces that shaped it, and to unravel the grand narrative of life etched in stone.",
            "The dead hung heavy in the air, a stillness settling over Indonesia's children.  The numbers, they told a story of a slow bleed. Ten years, and the toll on the young remained a stagnant pool.  The world cried out for progress, for the Millennium's promises to bloom, but the blossoms here wilted. Water and sanitation, they'd reached for those stars, but the children, the mothers, they were left in the shadows, clinging to a dwindling hope.\n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, seventy-two percent they said. But a midwife's hand, though gentle, can't mend a broken moon.  Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the dead of night, and those numbers, they whispered of a system failing, not a victory.\n\nDiarrhea, the children's scourge, claimed its share, and the seeking of help, it dwindled.  Post-natal care, a ghost in the night, its absence a heavy shroud.\n\nThe steel kiss of the surgeon's blade, a cesarean, a rare bloom at four percent.  But the city's light, it held the promise, seven percent, while the villages, shrouded in darkness, clung to a meager two.  A chasm yawned between them, a gulf of access, a testament to a system that favored the fortunate few.\n\nThe poorest, they reached out with empty hands, a twenty-seven percent gap, a silent scream lost in the din of indifference.  Their burdens weighed heavy, out-of-pocket costs, a wall of stone, barring them from the sanctuary of care.\n\nThe question hung in the air, a shroud of despair:  should they patch the holes, program by program, or build a bridge, a sturdy foundation for a system whole?  The allure of quick fixes, of targeted interventions, it was strong.  But the siren song of progress often drowned out the whispers of long-term gain.\n\nResources, they were fleeting, diverted like water seeking the lowest ground.  And the human heart, it too, followed the lure of abundance, leaving behind the neglected fields of care.  Duplication, a shadow twin, stalked the corridors of aid, a web of paperwork, a testament to a system that had forgotten the art of simple compassion.\n\nThe dead, they watched, their silence a stark reminder.  The children, they waited, their hope a fragile candle in the wind.  The question remained, unanswered:  would they build a system worthy of their lives?",
            "The shadow of Victorian convention fell long over the literature of the time, its tendrils reaching into every corner, every detail a testament to the grandeur and despair of the aristocracy. Yet, even in the heart of this gilded cage, two novels dared to break free, to burrow beneath the surface, to whisper of secrets and shadows. \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" – tales spun not from silk and satin but from the grit and grime of the human soul. \n\nThey are haunted by a strange and unsettling mystery, a flicker of the bizarre that shimmers beneath the surface of polite society. This darkness, this deviant whisper, serves to amplify the characters, to expose the raw nerves beneath their skin, laying bare the tangled knots of their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels weave their mysteries into the fabric of dreams, weaving tapestries of the subconscious, where reality bends and breaks. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these visions are a window into Oliver's soul, a reflection of his pain, his confusion, his growing awareness of the darkness that surrounds him.  The shooting that haunts him, revisited in a dreamlike haze, is a wound that refuses to heal.  He relives it, trapped in a maelstrom of senses, the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away a chilling reminder of his lack of control. The pain is not singular, but a constant ache, a throbbing reminder of his vulnerability. The question lingers: whose will brought about this misfortune? Is it his own, or is he a pawn in a larger, more sinister game?  \n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" the dreamlike quality takes on a more spectral form, a haunting presence that lingers at the edges of perception. Night, in its \"dreadful silence\" and \"fleeting hours,\" becomes a canvas for unspoken desires and buried secrets.\n\nThe very essence of these novels lies in their ability to transcend the conventions of their time. They dare to explore the dark corners of the human heart, to expose the fragility of innocence, the corrosive power of love and revenge. They are testaments to the enduring power of storytelling, to the human need to confront the shadows within.",
            "The air in the room hung thick with dust motes, each one a miniature sun caught in the weak rays slanting through the grimy windows.  The boy, no more than a wisp of a thing, sat hunched over a worn page, the words swimming before his eyes like drowned things. A whisper of a sigh escaped his lips. He was lost, adrift in a sea of letters that held no meaning. \n\nI’d seen it before, this look of bewilderment, this struggle against a language that felt as foreign as any tongue spoken on a distant shore. Adrian, they called him. A name like a melody in a language I barely understood. He spoke English, sure, but in that way a bird might mimic human speech – a shadow of the real thing.  It wasn’t until his mother came, her face etched with worry lines and her eyes filled with a silent plea, that the truth dawned on me.  \n\nShe spoke no English, only the guttural cadences of her native tongue. We exchanged words, fractured and halting, like two ships passing in the night, each searching for a common harbor. And then it hit me, a stark revelation in the dusty afternoon light: Adrian wasn’t failing to read, he was failing to decipher a foreign script. He knew the sounds, the rhythms, but not the code, the map that unlocked the secrets of the letters.\n\nIt was a simple truth, hidden in plain sight. And in that moment, I knew I had to help.  It wasn't a solution as grand as a restructuring of the entire educational system, nor a magical elixir to erase the language barrier. It was a one-on-one battle, a slow and careful teaching of the alphabet, of the sounds that formed words, of the stories that lay embedded in the spaces between those letters.\n\nAdrian’s struggle, I realized, was a reflection of a larger truth.  Here, in this land woven with the threads of a thousand languages, we face a challenge not of weakness, but of understanding. The path forward is not a single road, but a winding path through a thousand valleys, each one demanding a different approach, a different bridge to be built. Dual language programs, immersion, tutors, ESL classes — these are not competing forces, but threads in a tapestry, each one contributing to the whole.\n\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in the recognition that language is not merely a tool for communication, but a gateway to understanding, a portal to the soul. Whether it’s the lilting cadences of Spanish, the guttural rasp of Arabic, or the crisp pronouncements of English, each language carries within it a universe of stories, of history, of human experience. \n\nAnd to deny a child the opportunity to unlock those universes, to navigate those landscapes of words, is to deny them a part of their heritage, a part of their humanity.",
            "The rain fell hard against the tin roof, drumming a steady rhythm like the blood in a dead man's ears. He sat on the porch, a cigarette burning in his hand, the smoke twisting into the grey air. His father, skin stretched thin over bone, stared out at the yard, the rain blurring the edges of the world.\n\n\"What's your favorite bird?\" he'd asked, voice raspy, like dry leaves skittering across gravel.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" the old man said, eyes still fixed on the downpour.  He didn't turn, didn't look at him. \n\nThey sat in silence, the only sound the rain and the rasp of his father's breath.  \n\nThey were both haunted by something, something bigger than themselves, bigger than words.  Some folks called it God.  Others, ghosts.  He knew his father hadn't spoken of it in years.  He'd tried to find answers, to fill the void with something else.  Church, books, fleeting love affairs.  Nothing stuck. He was a hollow man, searching for something to hold onto in a world that didn't seem to care.\n\nHis father's hand, thin as a willow branch, reached out and rested on his knee. It was a gesture of comfort, of connection, fleeting as a butterfly's wing.  \n\n\"There's a darkness out there,\" his father said, his voice barely a whisper.  \"It's always been there.  But sometimes, it's closer.\"\n\nThe rain fell harder, the wind picking up, whipping the leaves against the old house.  \n\nThe old man's hand tightened on his knee, his grip fading like a dying ember. \n\n\nHe knew then that the darkness was closer now. \n\nHe'd asked his father about God, about the meaning of it all, but the answers had always been elusive, shrouded in the same fog that now hung over his soul.  Now, he understood.  There were some things you didn't ask.  Some questions best left unanswered.\n\n\n\nThe phone call came in December. Five days after his birthday. The doctor's voice, flat and clinical, told him the fight was over. His father was gone.\n\nHe didn't go to the funeral. Couldn't.  He couldn't bear to see the empty chair, the vacant space where his father's spirit had once resided.",
            "The notion of the Gothic novel is, in its essence and its name, a contradiction, a paradox of “Old-New,” as Ian Watt puts it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*. This mode of storytelling has been disparaged, lauded, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its “terrible sublime” (Burke). Horace Walpole, in *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the Gothic, wove together threads of \"ancient\" romantic tales and the “new” mimicry of nature found in burgeoning novels, creating a genre unto itself, a new way of telling stories. He dubbed it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic derives its power from echoes of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even at the time of *The Castle of Otranto*'s publication, the word \"Gothic\" carried a weight, used to describe a multitude of peoples, styles, and eras. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated, a shadow of the \"modern\" advancements in society and literature. The merging of the theatricality of \"Gothic\" with the novel's form, allowing for a more intimate glimpse into the minds of its characters, is what has allowed it to endure, remaining both outdated and strangely new to readers separated from its time of origin.\n\nOne of the most persistent themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in *The Castle of Otranto*. Chivalry is particularly potent for Gothic writers because of what it represented: the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, proficient—and the perceived lack of that ideal in the society they observed (particularly by Walpole). The use of chivalric concepts and manners romanticizes the \"Gothic past\" (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism) and attempts to elevate the present. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have, consciously or unconsciously, believed that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" embodied in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals who made up his present society. This concept is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.\n\nThe reader is presented with Frederic's chivalric traits before even meeting him: \n\nThe description paints Frederic with traditional chivalric imagery; he's a prince, he's suffered, been marked by tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The road stretched ahead, a ribbon of gray dust under a sky the color of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and silent, eyes fixed on the ground. They moved through the skeletal remains of a world stripped bare, the wind a rasping sigh through the empty husks of buildings.  This was the way now, a slow procession of broken things, a symphony of loss played on the strings of a long-dead sun. \n\nSupply, they called it – the way the scattered scraps of life found their way from one hand to the next, a chain forged in necessity. It was a damn fool thing, this chain. A web spun by men who thought they could control the world, but the world had other plans. \n\nMen like Oliver, with his words about \"efficiency\" and \"customer satisfaction,\" words that echoed hollowly in this wasteland. What use were customers when the world itself was dying? What good was a well-oiled machine when the fuel was gone?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand in his, a small anchor in the swirling emptiness. There was a time, he remembered, when the world had been different. A time when the very air thrummed with possibility. A time when men built things, not just moved them. A time when there were forests, and rivers, and laughter that rang clear as a bell.\n\nHe stopped, the wind whipping at his face, the taste of dust and ash on his tongue.  He looked at the boy, his face pale against the grayness, his eyes wide with a question he wouldn't ask. \"They say,\" he said, his voice a rasp, \"that the chain won't break. That it stretches from hand to hand, from one end of the world to the other.\" \n\nHe looked out at the wasteland, at the broken, twisted remains of what had once been. \"But,\" he said, \"I think maybe it's already broken.\"",
            "The sign creaked in the wind.  A single word, scrawled in a wavering hand: \"Hitler.\" Below it, a name: \"Burma.\" The girl stood alone, a figure swallowed by the dust and the sun. Ellen Page, they called her. Juno, the picture on the screen, a name whispered in the dark.  But here, in this place where the air hung thick and the shadows stretched long, she was just a girl with a sign.\n\nBurma. A land of jade and monsoon rains, a land where the mountains bled into the sky and the river snaked through the heart of the jungle. A land ruled by men who wore shadows for clothes and fear for a crown. They came to power in the blood of a coup, a whisper in the night that choked the life from the land.\n\nThey had tried to speak. The monks, cloaked in saffron, their voices rising like a prayer against the storm. A revolution whispered in the wind, a tide of voices demanding change. The \"Saffron Revolution,\" they called it. A flicker of hope in the darkness. \n\nBut the shadows had teeth. The army came, a tide of steel and fire. They burned the temples, crushed the whispers, drowned the prayers in blood.  \n\nThe girl on the corner, her face etched with the weariness of the world, knew this story. She knew of Kenji Nagai, his camera a witness to the violence, his life snuffed out by the shadows. She knew of Colonel Hla Win, his voice a ghost from the past, whispering of bodies counted in thousands. \n\nThis was not new. It was the story of empires, the story of power, the story of men who claimed to rule in the name of God, who choked the light from the world. \n\nShe thought of Tiananmen Square, the ghosts of students and intellectuals swallowed by the smoke.  She thought of Rwanda, a genocide painted in blood and tears. She remembered Hitler, his name a hiss in the dark, a nightmare that echoed through time. \n\nThe girl with the sign felt the weight of history on her shoulders. She was a single voice in the wind, a flicker of defiance against the shadows. But even a single voice, she knew, could change the world.",
            "The man sat hunched over the worn piano, his fingers tracing the dust motes dancing in the weak, yellow light.  Duke Ellington. His name hung in the air, a ghost in the room, like the scent of pipe tobacco and the memory of a long-gone rain.  The man knew the music, every note, every inflection.  He’d heard it in the smoke-filled clubs, in the shadows of the streets, in the hollow spaces of his own heart.  Ellington’s sound, it clung to him like a shroud.  Longevity, they called it.  But it was more than that. It was a shaping, a molding of sound, of men, into something greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe piano itself, a relic from a time before the ash, whispered its own stories.  Each key a weathered finger bone, each note a sigh escaping a silenced world.  Ellington’s touch, his presence, lingered in the wood, in the ivory, in the very silence between the notes.  He’d built an orchestra, not just a band, not just a collection of sounds.  He’d built a world.\n\nThe man closed his eyes, heard the muted trumpet wail, the clarinet sing, the bass rumble like a distant storm.  He saw the faces, etched in memory, the sweat on their brows, the fire in their eyes.  They were gone now, swallowed by the dust, but their music, their spirit, lived on.\n\nEllington understood the language of the soul.  He knew how to coax it out, how to shape it, how to give it voice.  He took the rough, the broken, the forgotten, and wove it into something beautiful, something lasting.\n\nHe’d learned to make the voice itself an instrument.  A growl, a whisper, a moan, a cry.  He’d used it to tell stories, to evoke emotions, to paint pictures with sound.  The man could hear it now, in the wind whistling through the empty streets, in the crackling of the dying fire.\n\nEllington’s music was a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.  Even in the face of oblivion, of silence, of ash, the music lived on.  It was a lifeline, a beacon in the darkness, a reminder that even in the ruins, something beautiful could still be found.",
            "The want gnawed at her, a hunger never satisfied. It started young, a flicker at fourteen, a fire by seventeen. Not for things, no. This was something deeper, a longing for a touch, a connection. Boys came and went, clumsy, fumbling things, drawn to her light but never finding purchase. She watched them, this parade of would-be suitors, and wondered at their effort, their desperate need to possess. But none held her. None stirred the emptiness within.  \n\nDays at home were quiet, a tapestry woven with the gentle rhythms of her parents' lives. They were good people, their love a constant, unspoken presence.  But she, she thrummed with a different energy, a restless spirit that chafed against their calm.\n\nNot today. Today, the air hung heavy, charged with an unseen tension. A scream, sharp and sudden, shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice thin and strained.  “Mom?” she called, fear a cold fist clenching her heart.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, crumpled and pale, clutching her side. \"Ow,\" her mother gasped, each syllable a shard of pain. \"Sweetheart... hospital...\"\n\n\"Hold on, Mom, I'm getting help.\" \n\nShe lifted her mother, the weight of her a familiar comfort, and carried her to the car. The hospital reeked of antiseptic and despair, but she felt only a fierce, unyielding purpose. She deposited her mother into the waiting hands of doctors, their faces grim, their movements swift.\n\nIt was a fall, a simple misstep from a rickety stool. A vase, a foolish reach. But now, the world tilted on its axis, the certainty of their tranquil life shattered.",
            "The dust settled on a world choked by its own making.  A sun, pale and wan, hung low in a sky like old parchment. This wasn't a world of green fields and plump harvests. This was a world where the earth itself had yielded its bounty to ash. But there, amongst the ruins, a way of life clung on. A way of life measured not in calories and cholesterol, but in the slow, measured rhythm of survival. They called it the Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of the old life, a memory of sun-drenched orchards and olive groves.  Here, in this desolate landscape,  it was a testament, a defiance, a prayer against the coming night.\n\n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this \"aMed\" diet, a scorecard of sustenance in a world where hunger gnawed at the edges of every day. It meant turning to the earth, to the sturdy roots and the green shoots, to the fish that swam in the few remaining pools of water. It meant favoring the fat of the olive, the oil that seeped from the earth like a promise. And it meant turning away from the flesh of the beast, from the things that choked the air with their putrescence.  \n\nThey had followed these women, these daughters of the earth, for twenty years.  Seven thousand, almost eight thousand, souls strong. Each one a story, a testament to the enduring spirit. Each one a voice whispering against the wind, a voice that spoke of resilience, of hope, of a life lived in the face of oblivion.\n\nThe women, their hands calloused, their eyes weary, filled out their records, their voices echoing in the stillness. They spoke of their meals, their days, their lives. They spoke of their losses, their triumphs, their fears. And through it all, they spoke of the aMed diet, a beacon in the darkness, a lifeline in a sea of despair.\n\n\nThey watched, these researchers, these chroniclers of the human spirit. They saw the women age, saw their faces etched with the lines of sorrow and the wrinkles of wisdom. They saw their bodies weaken, their limbs grow frail. But they also saw something else. They saw a strength that defied the odds, a spirit that refused to be broken. They saw the aMed diet, not just as a set of dietary recommendations, but as a symbol of hope, a testament to the enduring power of the human will.\n\nAnd in the end, as the dust settled and the sun dipped below the horizon, they knew. They knew that these women, these daughters of the earth, had given them a gift. They had given them a glimpse into the heart of humanity, a glimpse into the depths of human resilience. They had shown them that even in the face of oblivion, there was beauty, there was hope, there was life.",
            "The year was 2007. A sickness came down on the land, a fever dream of paper and ink. Houses, once symbols of hope, turned brittle and hollow. The towers of commerce, once monuments to man's ambition, shuddered and cracked. Men in suits, their faces pale and slick with sweat, whispered of numbers that meant nothing and things that didn't exist.  The air itself seemed to crackle with the avarice of it all.\n\nThey called it a crisis, a financial one, but it was more than that. It was the rot at the heart of things, the festering wound of greed that had been allowed to fester for too long. The politicians, with their empty promises and their hands outstretched for more, had fanned the flames. They'd loosened the reins, let the wolves in, and now the wolves were feasting.\n\nThe banks, fattened on easy money and reckless lending, had handed out loans like candy to anyone who'd ask. They built castles on sand, mortgages to folks who couldn't afford the shoes on their feet. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those ghostly specters of government oversight, swallowed it all, repackaging the poison and selling it to anyone who'd buy.\n\nAnd the people, blinded by the glitter and the promises of easy wealth, danced on the edge of the abyss. They bought more than they could afford, houses that were cobwebs spun from air. But the air would run out, the cobwebs would unravel, and the ground would open up to swallow them whole.\n\nIt was a slow burn, a gathering storm. And then, in the dead of night, it broke. The bubble burst. The wolves howled. And the people, they screamed. The towers crumbled, the houses fell, and the wolves feasted.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where the words turn to dust and the reader's eyes glaze over. Where characters stand around swapping backstories like old rugs at a pawn shop.  Dr. Merlin, she's seen it all. She's heard the complaints, the sighs of boredom, the slams of laptop lids in frustrated retreat. \n\nExposition ain't your friend. It's the slow, creeping fog that smothers the spark of the story.  We all know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But sometimes, even veterans of the word wars stumble into the quicksand of too much telling.\n\nThink of it like this: exposition is the character standing in the middle of the dusty road, spitting out a laundry list of facts about his past instead of showing you, the reader, who he is.  He tells you he's a former soldier, a failed poet, a lover of cheap whiskey and melancholic blues. You hear the words, but you don't *feel* him. You don't see the weariness etched in his eyes, the tremor in his hand, the way his soul clings to the last embers of a long-dead dream.\n\nTake that example of the heroine, heartbroken and mourning her murdered husband.  She doesn't need to spend two pages recounting their love story. Instead, let her actions speak. Show her clutching his worn shirt, her fingers tracing the familiar scent of woodsmoke and leather. Let her gaze linger on his empty chair, her tears falling onto a half-read book.\n\nGive the reader a glimpse of their bond through stolen glances, whispered secrets, shared laughter.  Let their love story unfold in the spaces between the words, in the unspoken language of shared memories and silent grief. \n\nDon't just tell the story.  Let the story breathe, let it bleed, let it live.",
            "The flickering box in the corner spat out its news, faces washed in the pale light of the screen. A man from Ashley, Ohio, a name like a rusted hinge – Shad Hostettler – had plunged a blade into his wife.  They showed his picture, a face slack with something feral. The newsman spoke of multiples wounds, of arrest, but the details, like dust, settled quickly. Two minutes, that’s all it got. \n\nThen, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, riddled with lead in the shadows of Sharon Woods. No name, no face for the boy, just the echo of a gunshot and the swift, cold touch of a SWAT team. They said the neighborhood was “rough,” a word that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken things. \n\nA bullet hole, a ghost in the skin of a hovering metal bird, a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 whispering its death song.  A five thousand dollar reward, a desperate plea for whispers in the dark.\n\nThe weatherman, a man with slicked-back hair and a practiced smile, promised rain and heat. A tease, a distraction.\n\nThen, the robbery. A man, they said, dark-skinned, a shadow in a hoodie. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the darkness, the blackness, the weight of it all.\n\nA drug kingpin from Texas, Rene Rodriguez, a name that tasted of sin and exile. He was sentenced to “three hundred” months, a number that hung heavy in the air. Hispanic, they said, a detail that had no business there.",
            "The bond between brothers, it cuts deep. Unflinching, unyielding. A knot of things tangled tight: love, hate, envy, a touch of something mean. They see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror. A truth laid bare when the dark comes. And that truth, it comes with a price. The cost of knowing. The cost of seeing.\n\nYou can't look into a brother's eyes without seeing your own face staring back. Not the face the world sees, but the one you try to hide. The one that bleeds out in your actions, in the dust your footsteps leave behind. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk a path choked with weeds and tangled vines. The air thick with the heat of a summer that will soon turn cold. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, set by pride and shadowed by a darkness neither can name. The scorn, the fierce love, the bitter undercurrents, they all rise to the surface in the end. One brother walks away from the wreckage, the other lost to the unforgiving swamp.  \n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, the narrator. He is a boy consumed by pride, a heart hardened by a need to be seen, to be strong. He wants a companion who can keep pace, a mirror reflecting his own image back to him. But Doodle, his younger brother, is born frail, a fragile bird with wings too weak to fly. This pain, this frustration, it festers and grows. It poisons the air between them, thick as the humid summer air. \n\nThe narrator's actions, his every thought, are driven by this wounded pride. He wants Doodle to be what he is not. He wants him to be strong, to be like him. He tries to force it, to mold him into his own image. But Doodle, he is a wild thing, a fragile bloom struggling to survive in a world that seeks to crush him.\n\nAnd in the end, the swamp claims what it always claims. The fragile, the broken, the ones who cannot keep pace. The narrator, he is left with the echo of his brother's laughter, the taste of guilt on his tongue, and the knowledge that some bonds, no matter how strong, can be broken.",
            "The gray matter, it thinks. A tangle of wires and whispers, a storm of lightning in the skull. Used to be they said the mind was a wax tablet, smooth and blank. Then a scroll, a book. Now they say a machine. A damned contraption of levers and gears.  They miss the point.\n\nThe senses, they come first. Sight, sound, touch, all bleeding into the darkness.  The world, a symphony of whispers, a language of flesh and shadow.  The brain, it sorts it out.  Bottom-up, they call it. Bricks laid one by one, a tower rising in the mind. But there's a hand guiding the work. A watchful eye.\n\nTop-down they call it.  A knowingness, a darkness that sees before the light.  A knowing that the box is black, not because it is black, but because it must be. \n\nThe mind, it filters.  A sieve through which the world is poured.  The unimportant falls away, the vital clings.  A name in the roar of the crowd, a blade of grass in the dust, a truth whispered in the dark.\n\nBut what is truth?  A memory, a ghost of what was. A story told and retold, each telling a little different.  Remember, they say.  Forgetting is a wound that never heals.  But remembering, that's a kind of forgetting too.  The past, it slips through the fingers, like smoke.\n\nThe mind, it stores.  In the crevices of the brain, in the echoes of synapses.  A library of moments, a graveyard of dreams.  But even memories fade.  The book, it falls apart, the words blur.  Only shadows remain.\n\nHow is it organized?  A web, they say.  Connections, threads spun from thought to thought.  A map of the mind, a labyrinth of the soul.  But maps lie.  And souls, they are not maps.\n\nThe mind, it is a mystery.  A dark, unknowable place.  And the more we think we understand it, the more we realize how little we know.",
            "The man with eyes like old obsidian watched the smoke curl from the boy's cigarette. A pale ghost in the dusk. Huxley, he said, a name like dust on a windswept plain.  He spoke of a world gone soft, of flesh puppets dancing to the tune of progress. A world traded its soul for a cheap and fleeting pleasure.  \n\nHe tapped the worn paperback in his hand.  Brave New World. A world where they manufactured happiness, where the individual was a ghost in a machine.  They preached community but lived in cages of their own making.  \n\n\"He saw it coming,\" the man rasped, his voice a dry whisper. \"The trap, the gilded cage. The hunger for more, the endless consuming.  The machine grinding on.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, tracing the words on the faded cover.  \"They forgot what it meant to feel. To be truly alive.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the man sighed, his gaze fixed on the dying embers of their fire. \"They traded their souls for a bowl of synthetic gruel.  And Huxley, he knew the cost.\"\n\nThe wind picked up, a low moan through the skeletal trees.   \n\n\"He saw the world turning cold, abandoned by God. A graveyard of bones, built on the backs of the forgotten.\"  \n\nThe boy shivered, pulling his worn coat tighter. \n\n\"He saw us coming,\" the man said, his voice a harsh whisper. \"He saw the darkness gathering.\"  He looked at the boy, his eyes burning with a strange light. \"And he warned us.\"",
            "The dust of time clung to the bricks of this town, this University Park. Two years I'd walked these streets, four and a half semesters maybe, counting the slow bleed of days into each other. The campus sprawled like a wounded animal, its limbs stretching ever outward.  East Halls, they called it, where I'd first been caged like a youth.  A world away, it seemed, from the heart of things - Willard, a name that echoed with the ghosts of a thousand lectures, the Creamery, a monument to sweetness and regret, the new health services building, a testament to the fragility of our bodies. \n\nBack then, the land between East Halls and the rest was a wasteland, empty and untamed. Now it was choked with concrete and purpose-built dreams. A sprawling labyrinth of asphalt and brick. Getting from one place to another, it felt like traversing a continent. \n\nAn old dog, a man not much older than myself, told me a story. Said the East Halls had once been a distant outpost, separated by acres of silence.  Now, the silence was gone, replaced by the hum of progress, the clatter of hurried steps.\n\nI thought about it, about the time it took to get from one side of this campus to the other.  A walk to Willard from the east could be a pilgrimage, a test of endurance. Twenty-five minutes, maybe more. The wind a bitter slap against my face, the rain a cold shroud.\n\nA friend, a man who had learned the language of the road again after years of silence, spoke of the bicycle. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his voice weary with the wisdom of experience.\n\nHe was right. A bicycle, it is more than just a machine. It is a rebellion against the tyranny of distance, a whisper of freedom in a world that seeks to confine us.\n\nI bought one myself, a steel horse with gears that clicked like the bones of a long-dead beast.  It transformed my world.  The twenty-five-minute slog to Thomas became a five-minute sprint. A fleeting pleasure, a stolen moment of grace. \n\nBut the roads, they are not kind. Pollock Road, a ribbon of asphalt that cuts through the heart of the campus, a shortcut that feels like a hazard.  It demands attention, vigilance, a refusal to be consumed by the chaos.\n\nWalking, it is a different kind of journey. A time for reflection, for the slow unfolding of thoughts. But time is a thief, and I have little to spare.  \n\nThe bicycle, it is my salvation. My chariot of fire, my escape from the tedium of endless motion. It is a reminder that there is beauty in the mundane, that even in the heart of this sprawling, grasping city, there is still a place for the wind in our hair and the sun on our faces."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust of the road clung to my boots, a gritty echo of the wasteland. It was in the dirt, in the spines of the wind-whipped trees, that I saw it first, a truth clear and cold:  the world was broken, piece by piece, the seams splitting open. I saw it in the way folks huddled, eyes downcast, faces etched with a weariness deeper than any sun could scorch. \n\nAnd I knew then, in the marrow of my bones, that service was the only prayer left. Not the kind whispered in pews, but the kind lived out, hands calloused and worn, tending to the hurt places. This ain't no fancy notion, see. This is the gospel I preach, the creed I live by. Respect for the broken, the forgotten, the ones society casts aside. \n\nIt ain't easy, this work. It claws at you, under your skin, in the hollow places. But it's in those dark corners, where shadows gather and whispers turn to screams, that you find the truest measure of a man. It's in the eyes of a child, scared and lost, that you see the reflection of a world gone wrong.  \n\nI wasn't raised with silver spoons.  I seen folks fall, seen families crumble, seen the rot seep into the heart of things. College didn't offer answers, just more questions. But then, one day, I met a boy, scared and alone, caught in a web woven with pain. It was like a mirror, reflecting the darkness back at me.  And I knew, with a certainty that burned hotter than any sun, that this was my path.\n\nI ain't one for empty words, for promises whispered on the wind. I believe in action, in the weight of a hand reaching out, in the quiet strength of a voice saying, \"You ain't alone.\" I believe in the power of connection, of finding light in the darkest corners.",
            "The air hung heavy with the dust of a dying world. This paper wrestles with the ghosts of sleep, the demons of insomnia, as they haunt the landscapes of both body and mind. There are two maps we must follow to understand this darkness: the map of biology, charting the terrain of genes and the flesh; and the map of culture, tracing the shadows cast by society, race, and circumstance. We'll lay bare the bones of each model, examining the research they offer, the truths they illuminate, and the mysteries they leave unsaid.\n\nInsomnia, a thief in the night, steals the solace of sleep, leaving behind a hollow ache in its wake. It can be a solitary beast, a primary disorder, or a harbinger of deeper troubles, a symptom of mental anguish or the weight of physical illness. It claws its way into our lives through the Dyssomnias, the Parasomnias, and the lingering tentacles of other ailments. \n\nThe biological model, like a surgeon dissecting the human machine, probes for the roots of sleeplessness in the very fabric of our being.  It whispers of genes passed down through generations, of the rhythmic dance of neurotransmitters in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a lone sentinel guarding the gates to slumber.  There are stories, for example, of neurons bathed in the glow of orexin, their whispers controlling the flow of wakefulness and rest. Studies on mice, those creatures so often our proxies in unraveling the mysteries of life, suggest that the GABAB receptor plays a pivotal role in this dance.  When activated, it ushers in the embrace of sleep.  But what if this receptor falters, its whispers silenced, its embrace withdrawn?  Could it be that the very blueprint of our being, etched in our genes, holds the key to our sleepless nights?\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. The sociocultural model, a cartographer of human experience, reminds us that our sleep is also shaped by the world around us.  It speaks of the tapestry woven by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and the ever-shifting sands of time.  It tells us that the shadows of our past, the burdens we bear, the anxieties that gnaw at our souls, all contribute to the symphony of sleeplessness.\n\nThese two maps, the biological and the sociocultural, offer glimpses into the labyrinth of insomnia. They show us that sleep is not merely a biological imperative but a cultural construct, a delicate dance between our genes and our environment.",
            "The wind rattled the bones of the world, carrying whispers of a sound not heard but felt - a sound that lived in the marrow of things. This was the land of the unheard. Here, the silence was a living presence, a shroud wrapped tight around the ears. It was the silence of the empty road stretching into the gray dust, the silence of the wind whistling through the canyons of broken buildings, the silence of a world that had forgotten how to speak. This was Central Auditory Processing Disorder. Not a failure of the ear, but a failure of the mind to hear, a failure to make sense of the symphony of sounds.\n\nThe ears worked, but the music died in the labyrinthine halls of the brain. Words blurred, sounds tangled, and the world became a cacophony of half-heard whispers.  It was a battlefield, this place where sound went to die. The boy with the quiet eyes, the teacher saw it in his struggle, in the way he turned his head, straining to catch the lost syllables, in the way he stumbled over words like they were stones on a treacherous path.\n\nThe teacher, a weathered hand in a glove of worn leather, knew the signs. The child who seemed to be daydreaming, the one who couldn't follow directions, the one who struggled with rhyming games and word searches.  They were the echoes, the ghosts of sound, lost in the static of their own minds. \n\nThere were no tests for this, no maps to guide them through the maze. Only observation, intuition, and a desperate hope to find the missing notes, the fragments of sound that the world denied them.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, speaks of a truth: disguise, though it can weave a web of deceit for a time,  eventually unravels, leaving the wearer bare. A man or woman can lose themselves in the borrowed skin, a hollow echo of what they once were.  To shed the guise, to reclaim one's true face, is to risk the sting of exposure, the chill of alienation.  For some, the world may accept the revelation, shrug and move on. But others, their trust broken,  will recoil, their eyes filled with the ice of betrayal.\n\nThe pretense of gender, a particularly treacherous game, lays bare the heart of the matter. Why, one must ask, would a soul choose to abandon their own identity, to walk in the shadow of another?  In Viola's case, the answer lies in the harsh realities of a world hostile to women. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"  (5.1.247-249 )  A stranger in a strange land, she dons the armor of masculinity, seeking safety in a man's guise. But this protection comes at a price. The embrace of sisterhood, a lifeline for women, is severed. She walks alone.  And worse, Olivia, blinded by the mask, falls in love with the illusion, mistaking Cesario for the man he is not.  \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138)  \n\nAnd what of the unspoken desires that simmer beneath the surface? Orsino, the Duke, drawn to Cesario, cries out, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261) Is Olivia's love a reflection of her own hidden yearnings, or a mockery of societal expectations?  Twelfth Night, a mirror to the age, offers a glimpse into the complexities of the human heart, where deception can both reveal and conceal the truth.  Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a shallowness that mocks genuine love. She treats Cesario/Viola as a family member, a distant echo of the passion she once held.  \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The dust clung to everything in South West Africa, a shroud over the land that choked the sun and settled deep in the bones.  The German Reich had carved its mark on these bones too, a bloody brand seared into the flesh of the land.  They spoke of genocide, of the Ovaherero and Nama decimated, their names whispered like curses on the wind.  But empires, like men, are composed of more than nightmares.  There were others, too, those who sought knowledge, who yearned to unravel the secrets of the world.  They came to the colony, these men of learning, seeking to impose order on the chaos, to bring light to the darkness.\n\nAnd the light they brought was uneven, fractured by the harsh realities of the land and the men who ruled it. In East Africa, the Germans, like iron-wrought hands, reached out and built schools, fostering a literate generation. But here, in this desolate land, they turned their backs. The task of education, that vital spark of civilization, was left to the missionaries, frail flickering candles in the vast expanse of ignorance. \n\nThe government, its heart cold and calculating, poured its resources into educating its own, building schools for the white men who claimed ownership of this land.  The native Africans, their voices drowned out by the clatter of progress, were left to wander in the shadows.\n\nThe echoes of this neglect reverberated long after the German flag had been lowered.  While other colonies boasted of educated Africans, here, in this land of dust and despair, the majority remained untouched, shrouded in the veil of illiteracy.\n\nThis is the story of South West Africa, a story of contrasts and contradictions.

            "The music they called Popular, in the hundred years since its birth, had birthed so many sounds, so many names, it was like trying to catalog the stars. Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk - each a constellation in its own right, each with its own nebulae of subgenres swirling beneath. But Heavy Metal, born of the rock that came before, clawed its way up, a beast with a heart of fire and a tongue of steel. Forty years it had raged, and within that time, it had become a galaxy unto itself.\n\nIt was expressive, this metal. The darkness it wore was a cloak, a shield, but within it, a storm of emotion roiled. Joy and rage, despair and defiance, all given voice in the clang of guitars and the thunder of drums. It was diverse, too, a tapestry woven from a thousand threads. From the moment it first took hold, folks began to see the potential, the ways to twist and bend it to their will. Subgenres bloomed, each a unique flower in the metal garden, and still, the growth continued.\n\nToday, the metal landscape is a sprawling wilderness. The lines blur, the boundaries fade. So many branches, so many riffs, so many voices, it's hard to say where metal truly begins and ends. But to understand the music that fills the airwaves now, the music that seeps into your bones, you have to understand its origins. It started with a spark, a fire in the heart of rebellion, and grew into a tidal wave.\n\nMetal is a movement, not just a genre. It's a hunger for something more, a yearning for the raw, the real. More bass, more volume, more fury. Less pretense, more soul poured into every note. It's a music of grit and grind, where the musicians are masters of their instruments, their fingers dancing across strings like wraiths.\n\nAnd it's a music born of darkness, a child of the night. It's haunted by the ghosts of drugs and despair, echoes of a psychedelic era where boundaries were broken and reality itself was questioned. It has its roots in the Romantic era's obsession with the dark side of the human experience. Lyrics like those penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter\" speak to this darkness, a descent into madness, a glimpse into the abyss.\n\nThis song, with its swirling, discordant melody and its lyrics that speak of chaos and confusion, it's a harbinger of things to come. It's a bridge between the light and the darkness, a turning point in music history. The Beatles, those icons of pop, dared to explore the shadows, to confront the darkness within. They surprised the world, and in doing so, they unleashed a force that would change music forever.",
            "The canvas breathes the silence of a man's longing.  Henri Rousseau, before the world knew surreal dreamscapes, he was painting his own. The Dream, that picture from ‘10, it ain’t just a woman awestruck by some fantastical land. It’s Rousseau himself, reaching for something just out of grasp. Recognition, acceptance, the whispered praise of the art world he hungered for.  A hunger born in the heart of a man with no fancy schooling, a customs man, a gabelou they called him, toiling away till forty.  He dreamt of brushstrokes that spoke, not the gruff strokes of a man who’d seen worlds beyond canvas.\n\nHis life, it was a canvas itself. Born in Laval, his father a man of trade, he found no solace in hammers and nails.  He yearned for color, for light, for stories whispered on the wind.  Then came the deaths, the toll of loved ones, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a soul heavy with grief.  Painting, it became his refuge, a way to mend the broken pieces.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the ones who romanticized the peasant life on canvas.  He was the peasant, the man in the street, his dreams as raw and real as the paint he bled onto the cloth. He saw the world with eyes that yearned for something more, something beyond the mundane drudgery of his days.\n\nThe art world, it was a beast with sharp teeth and a hunger for the new, the different.  And Rousseau, he was a man who craved its approval. He saw the giants of the time, Matisse, Picasso, their names whispered in hushed tones, their works hung in gilded galleries. He wanted that, that recognition, that validation.\n\nBut there was a struggle within him, a battle between conformity and individuality. Should he mimic the styles he admired, the ones that pleased the critics, or should he stay true to his own vision, even if it meant remaining in the shadows?  The Dream, it was a reflection of that struggle, a woman lost in a world of her own making, searching for something, yet afraid to reach out.",
            "The world’s sharp thinkers, they say, see a kinship between good and beauty. Truth and grace, they whisper, bound by some unseen thread. Keats himself, in his ode to the Grecian urn, puts it plain: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much in this life, facts and figures, lessons hard-won. But beauty and rightness, these things, they seem to find us, not the other way around. They’re whispered in the dark, not taught in classrooms.  Both, in their way, try to name the unnameable. We study art and morals, seeking to explain what makes a song sing or an action just. But the heart of it, the core, it shimmers just beyond the reach of words.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa, for instance. We dissect her, praise her brushstrokes, her pose, the way light catches her smile. But do we truly touch the soul of that painting? No. There’s a place beneath the surface, a space where words fail and a hush falls. It’s the same with right and wrong. We build codes, pronounce judgments, but at the heart of it, there’s a feeling, a knowing that transcends the rules. Flannery O’Connor, her words like shards of glass, saw this truth:  “A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Literature, like morality, it aches with a depth that language can’t fully grasp. Wittgenstein, he understood this too, saying, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.”\n\nThis is the power of art and morality, the thing that binds them. They reach us in a way that defies logic, in a realm where feeling reigns.  McKean, he said it right, “Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”  And those values, they echo the deepest parts of ourselves, the whispers of our souls.  They are the truth, the beauty, the only things that truly matter.",
            "The land they called Germany now, it held itself up stiff and strong. A country stitched together from the shadows of the Alps in München to the stark bones of the Baltic in Kiel. One culture ran through it all, from the cobbled streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden crouched upon the Elbe. It was a culture born of many pieces, of tribes long gone, each one leaving its mark upon the land. \n\nGermania, the name itself echoed with the ghosts of those ancient peoples. Where it came from, who first spoke it, that was a question gnawed at by scholars and whispered by the wind. Tacitus, he wrote of the Tungrians, a tribe that called themselves Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls.  Caesar, the Roman, he called them “Germanus,” a word taken from the mouths of the Gauls themselves, a way to set them apart, the conquered and the unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor, in the tongue of the Gauls. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of them in the Gallic Wars, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers say it came from the spear they wielded, the ger, or perhaps from the Irish word “garim,” meaning \"to shout,\" a people known for their voices, loud and raw. The truth, like the wind, it shifts and blows, leaving only whispers in its wake.\n\nTacitus, he wrote of them as a people untouched, pure, untouched by the tide of migration. He painted a picture of a land where the sky was harsh, the land wild, and the people fierce. He wondered why anyone would leave the warmth of Rome for such a place, for Germania. A land where the wind carried the ghosts of battles long past. \n\nAnd the Romans, they came and went, taking what they could, leaving their mark on the land, but never truly settling. They traded, they fought, they took their spoils, and then they returned to their own empire, leaving the Germans to their own fate. \n\nBut the Germans, they were a people of the land, they knew it like the back of their hand. They traded their goods, their skills, and sometimes, their blood, serving in the Roman legions. They were a people woven from the threads of many stories, their past a tapestry of shadows and light, waiting to be unraveled.",
            "Downward, the stare. A blankness. Comprehension, a hard glint in the eye, but no feeling. Just the slow, methodical turning of the mind, dissecting the scene. Thoughts, fleeting shadows, flitting in and out of consciousness, never quite taking hold. A clean, cold efficiency, like a knife slicing through air. \n\nThere'd been that book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a man who knew, or thought he knew, about art. It'd promised to unlock the secrets, to teach the mind how to see. How to strip away the clutter, the overwhelming detail, and find the essence.  To see a bowl of fruit not as a bowl of fruit, but as a simple arrangement of shapes, a study in light and shadow.\n\nHe looked down at the scene before him, but the artist's frame wouldn't come.  The world was too much, too raw, too full of the things that lived and died and rotted. Picasso, Monet, the Renaissance masters, they'd all had their colors, their phases, their stories. His would be different. His would be brown. \n\nThe hand reached out, a thief in the night, grasping the implement of creation. Muscles tensed, a tremor ran through the arm, and the hand plunged into the swirling depths.  Water, clear and cold, embraced the hand, a mirror reflecting the image of a soul drowning in its own grime.  A moment of stillness, then a spasm, a flailing, a desperate attempt to make something, anything, out of the formless void. \n\nThe mop, a limp appendage held in a trembling hand, the green tie a noose around the neck.  Eyes fixed on the unholy offering, a monument to human waste, a silent scream of disgust.  A flush, a sigh, a futile attempt at purification.  The toilet paper, a flimsy shield against the horrors, wrapped around the hand like a shroud.",
            "The road bleeds young.  Takes them like a hawk in the sky, those eyes bright and eager behind the wheel.  The doctors say it's the way their brains are wired, still soft, still forming.  They call it \"risk-taking\" but it's more like a hunger, a need to be seen, to feel alive.  And the road, it just swallows them whole.\n\nThey say it's the inexperience too, the lack of miles under their belts.  They don't know the feel of the asphalt, the whispers of the wind through the trees, the way the rain can turn a highway into a river of glass.  They think they're invincible, these young drivers, until they're not.\n\nAnd they go with their peers, close huddled in the car, like lambs to the slaughter.  They laugh and they sing, oblivious to the danger.  One wrong move, one moment of distraction, and it's over.\n\nCalifornia tried to stop it, these provisional licenses, curfews, passenger limits.  But it's a band-aid on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they're not ready.  Not for the responsibility, not for the weight of the world on their shoulders.  There's a man, Zuckerman, says even eighteen is too young.  Says their brains are still learning, still forming.  That the need for thrills, the hunger for danger, it's hardwired.\n\nSo what do we do?  Push them into the fire, let them learn the hard way?  Or do we wait?  Wait until their brains are forged, until the recklessness fades, until the road no longer beckons them like a siren song?\n\nThey're coming, these young drivers, millions of them.  The Baby Boomers' children, ready to take their place on the asphalt.  And if we don't do something, if we don't protect them, if we don't teach them the respect the road demands, then the road will keep taking them.  One by one.\n\nWe need to make a stand.  We need to tell them, \"No.\"  Not yet.  Not until you're ready.",
            "The Library of Congress holds a collection of Edison's early films, ghosts flickering across time. Fifteen trick films, a history lesson in illusions, from 1895 to 1901.  I watched them, each one a whispered secret of a vanishing age.  Most clung to the old ways, bound by a poetics of artifice. \n\nTheir stage was the frame, a proscenium arch barring the way to anything else. No wandering eye of the camera, no movement beyond the rigid confines. Long shots, medium shots, that was all they knew. Like a play, the audience was meant to see it all at once, no closer, no further.  \n\nThe actors, confined by this stage, danced a slow, sideways jig. Their steps like shadows across a dusty floorboard.  In “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), they come and go, flitting across the frame like startled birds, but never truly leaving.  \n\nClose-ups, the intimate whispers of film, were absent. No probing gaze into the depths of a soul. The camera held aloof, a silent judge, seeing it all, but never truly touching.\n\nAnd the films themselves, short bursts of conjured magic, lived and died within a single shot. A minute, maybe less, a fleeting glimpse into a world constructed of smoke and mirrors.  The story, if there was one, unfolded in a quick flash, like a magician's hand, revealing a secret then whisking it away.\n\nBut there were exceptions, whispers of change in the wind. The very notion of a \"shot\" could be stretched, manipulated.  \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895)  a prime example. The severed head, a shock of darkness, appearing and disappearing, a trick played on the eye. A single “shot,” but a whisper of a thousand fragmented moments, stitched together to weave a spell.",
            "The man John Taylor,  he came from Carolina,  a man of the soil,  a farmer. But the land, it didn't just feed him, it shaped him. Shaped him into a man who spoke out,  his voice ringing with the conviction of a man who'd seen the earth bleed and the sky bleed too.  He believed in the Republic,  believed in men free to tend their own furrows,  free from the grasping tendrils of government. \n\nThis belief,  it was the seed from which all his other thoughts grew.  Sovereignty,  the Constitution,  even the courts,  all were filtered through this lens,  this agrarian vision of a world where the soil was king and the man was its steward. He saw a chance in these new United States,  a chance to build something true, something untainted by the old ways.  No ancient gods, no feudal chains, just men and the land, bound by a contract forged in the sweat of their brows. He believed in rights,  natural rights,  rights that belonged to every man simply by virtue of being born. He believed these rights were a chain,  each one linked to the others,  and if one broke,  the whole chain would snap.  And government,  it was like a hungry beast,  always ready to snatch at those chains, to pull men down from their rightful place.\n\nHe saw the good and the bad in men,  a duality woven into the fabric of their being.  He spoke of it often, this duality,  how government,  being man-made,  would inevitably reflect that duality.  He called for a government that acknowledged this truth,  a government that protected the good and contained the bad. A government that fostered the land,  protected property,  and kept greed in check. He believed a government run by men,  even the best of men, would always be susceptible to the lure of power,  that their hands would reach for more than they were given.  But he also believed that men,  in their hearts,  yearned for something more than power. They yearned for freedom,  for the chance to live their lives according to their own lights.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution,  a strict constructionist,  believing that the government should only have the powers explicitly granted to it. Anything more,  he argued,  was a slippery slope,  a path leading to tyranny. He saw the danger in a large,  powerful Federal government,  a government that could easily become despotic,  a government that would drain the lifeblood from the land and the people. \n\nHe looked to the Declaration of Independence,  to the words that declared the United States a union of sovereign states,  and saw in it a blueprint for a government that respected the autonomy of its people. It was a government of,  by,  and for the people,  not a government that ruled over them. The government,  he believed,  was a mere servant,  a tool to be used to protect the rights of the individual,  not a master to be obeyed.",
            "The numbers in the white-light box, Figure 17, told a story. A steep drop in the third month. A kind of falling away. Disheartening, it was. Why it happened, hard to say. Winter's grip on the campus, cold and unforgiving, likely kept folks from biking or walking. December, the semester's end, a blur of deadlines and papers and packing things away. The commuter log, maybe, a thing left behind in the rush. Then the holidays, a season of lights and tinsel and a break from the grind. A long month of stillness. Classes resumed in January, but the numbers stayed low. February, a mystery.\n\nMaybe, like a fire, the project burned bright at first, then settled into embers. A natural thing. To fight that, we cooked up the Carpool Challenge, a blaze of competition in March. It worked, the numbers climbed again. But the fight, it was there. Holding onto the flame, against the seasons, against the pull of routine.\n\nThe truth is, folks love their cars. The freedom, the independence, it's woven into the fabric of things. To get them to leave it behind, you gotta offer something more. We gave out goodies, gift certificates for coffee and meals and massages, even a bookstore or two. Bigger prizes, though, might have done more. A bike, a hybrid, even a sleek electric car, that might have pulled folks in. The prizes, they stayed the same, a steady drip. But imagine, a gradual escalation. A whisper of a bike in December, then a hybrid in January, the electric car a prize for the bold in February. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen.",
            "The ticker, IHF, it whispers on the wire, a cage for a phantom.  An ETF, they call it, a security, a basket of hopes woven from the threads of a hundred companies.  Like a spider’s web, it catches the market’s fly, but with less grace, less artistry.  They say it tracks an index, mimics the dance of the market, but what market? The one where men in suits whisper numbers and fortunes are lost and found like stray dogs in the night?\n\nThis IHF, it promises diversification, a shield against the storm.  But is it a shield or a shroud? It offers the liquidity of a single stock, the bite of a quick trade, the comfort of owning a sliver of a thousand dreams. But at what cost?\n\nThey speak of expense ratios, of commissions paid, of the cold hand of the market taking its due.  They speak of benefits, but benefits for whom?  The men in suits, the ones with eyes like vultures, circling the carcass of the unwary?\n\nThe ten who hold the reins, the ten who form the backbone of this beast – they’re the ones to watch.  Sixty-three percent, they say, of the IHF’s weight rests on their shoulders.  A kingmaker’s dominion, a cabal of shadows.\n\nThey dangle a promise of returns, a whisper of a higher yield, a lower beta.  But is it truth or a siren’s song, luring the innocent to their doom?  The numbers, they dance and swirl, a hypnotic waltz of percentages and probabilities.  But the heart, the human heart, it knows better.\n\nThe true test lies not in the cold logic of the spreadsheet, but in the fire of experience.  To own the ten, to hold them in your hand, not as a fraction, not as a shadow, but as whole, living things.  That is the only true measure.",
            "The land of dreams, a place Poe called Thulé. A word borrowed, he said, from the ancients, from Virgil’s pen. An island north, they said, beyond the known world, where the Greeks had set its edge. But the whispers of a darker source, a Germanic one, echo in the shadows. Poe, a man steeped in the lore of the Germans, a kinship with their words and their ways.\n\nSome say he was a student of Goethe, a shadow walker in the woods of his imagination. Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of the inkwell, sees the kinship in the lines of Poe’s “Politian” and Goethe’s “Mignon,” a weaving of echoes and similarities.\n\nGoethe, the master of words, the weaver of “Faust,” a tale spun in two parts, darkness and light. In the second, a poem called “The King of Thulé.” A king, bereft of his queen, drinks deep from a goblet gifted by her hand. Grief consumes him, a slow tide pulling him under. He, too, seeks the edge of the world, a cliff overlooking the sea. He casts the goblet, a symbol of his loss, into the waves, closes his eyes, and joins the darkness.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land,” a landscape of shadows, a king haunted by the ghosts of his past, a world drained of color, of joy. One might see in this king a reflection of Poe himself, a doppelganger, a mirror held up to his own sorrow, his own escape into the bottle. And the words “Thulé,” echoed in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” like a whispered warning from the abyss.\n\nThulé, a bookend in Poe’s poem, a haunting refrain. A land of dreams, a place of loss, a path to the edge. \n\nPoe, a man who walked in the shadows, who knew the heart of darkness, who found solace in the company of ghosts. He found in Goethe, a kindred spirit, a fellow traveler on the road to the unknown.",
            "The law in this here California, it says a customer can get more than just pocket change if they fall and break their bones over a spilled applesauce.  It speaks of 'punitive damages' - a fancy name for making the store pay extra, real extra, for being careless. But to get those, the customer, Miss Palmer, she gotta prove the store manager, Mr. Martin, didn't just make a mistake, he was downright mean.  \n\nNow, a judge ain't gonna toss this claim out quick, not on account of a spill and a broken back. To get those punitive damages, Miss Palmer gotta show that Mr. Martin knew good and well that not cleanin' up that mess could hurt somebody, but he done it anyway, on purpose. Like he was willfully blind, seein' the danger but choosin' to ignore it. \n\nSee, she's gonna say that Mr. Martin should have known better.  He'd been told about spills before - other folks had slipped and fallen. It happened more than once, in fact. Six times in the year before Miss Palmer went tumblin' down. And yet, he dismissed it, said he was too busy eatin' his dinner. \n\nNow, whether the judge sees his actions as downright despicable, that's a tougher sell. But with all those accidents, it's a story that might stick.\n\nIt all happened on a Wednesday, October 13th, 5:00 p.m. Rich Wayne, a fella workin' at the store, told Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill.  Mr. Martin, he just said, \"Dinner break, gotta eat.\" Then, 15 minutes later, Mary Haddigan, another employee, gave him the same heads-up, same answer. \n\nAnd then, at half past five, Miss Palmer came along, slipped, and went down hard.

            "The dust of four years settled on the classroom, the air still thick with the heat of debate.  Islam. The word itself hung heavy, a question mark in the air. Was it a religion of peace, or a wellspring of violence? The question, it seemed, only deepened in the wake of the falling towers, a knife twisting in the gut of a nation. The airwaves, once choked with suspicion, now whispered of tolerance, of understanding. A black man named Obama, with a name that tasted of the East, rose to the highest office. A world turned, it seemed, on its axis.\n\nThe Prophet's story, though, that was a different beast. It clung to me, a whisper in the dark. The man I'd imagined, the sword-wielding conqueror, the one who forced his faith upon the world, was gone. In his place stood a figure of meekness, a martyr misunderstood, drawing people to him like moths to a flame. A whisper of doubt flickered. Was this the truth, or a carefully crafted image?\n\nThe parallels with the life of Jesus, they haunted me. The loaves and fishes, multiplied on command, echoed through the ages, a story spun for both.  Was this a subtle theft, a borrowing of divinity, a way to elevate Muhammad to the same plane as Christ? The thought sat like a stone in my stomach. \n\nThen there were the stories, whispered from one man to another, each retelling a blur of hearsay.  These were supposed to be testaments, proof of the Prophet's truth, but they felt hollow, lacking the weight of direct experience.  \n\nBut the thing that gnawed at me the most was the portrait they painted of Muhammad.  A gentle soul, wise and humble, a beacon of light. History, though, whispered a different tale, a story of conquest and violence.  A man, perhaps, who used his faith to build an empire.  Did the faithful know this history?  Or had they chosen to embrace a myth, a carefully curated image of their prophet?",
            "The dust of the world settled on the bones of what Jesus preached.  His voice, once a clarion call, faded to a whisper in the wind of time.  Christianity, born in his image,  grew, twisted, and spread, a vine choking the saplings of his original intent.  The world turned, a wheel ever grinding, and the light of progress cast long shadows on the past.\n\nOld ways clung to the bones of men, resistant to the wind of change. But the tide was turning.  A hunger stirred, a yearning for something lost.  A thirst for the pure spring of Jesus' words, unmuddied by the centuries of accretion.\n\nLike a slow, inexorable flood, this yearning would rise.  It would wash over the land, erasing the mortar of dogma, stone by stone, layer by layer.  The churches, those grand monuments to tradition, would stand watch as the tide receded, revealing a truth buried beneath the silt of time.\n\nA new dawn would break, a return to the source.  A world where the echoes of Jesus' voice rang clear, unburdened by the weight of centuries.  The churches, though still standing, would become vessels for this new understanding, their sermons echoing the simplicity of the original message.\n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the faithful would gather, not as denominations, but as a single, unified voice.  Differences would dissolve, replaced by a shared understanding, a common ground forged in the crucible of history.\n\nHistory itself seemed to turn in cycles, a slow, relentless dance of progress and regress.  Like the Roman Empire, once the persecutor, now the convert, the world would turn again.  The chains of the past would loosen, the shackles of tradition would fall away, and the world would be reborn in the image of the carpenter's son.  The path to this future was paved with a single, unwavering truth: a willingness to see Jesus' words not as literal pronouncements, but as a timeless reflection of the human spirit.\n\nAnd then, as always, there was the beginning, the source, the echo that resonated through the ages.  Judaism, the wellspring of faith, where monotheism took root, where the scriptures whispered promises of a coming savior.",

The owners, they saw the workers not as men, but as cogs, expendable parts in a machine built only for profit. \n\nSinclair, he saw it.

The line between man and beast blurred in those factories, a butcher's shop more than a place of work.\n\nThe men, they worked till they bled, till their hands were raw and their backs bent double.  For what? A pittance, a cruel joke in the face of the wealth the owners amassed.  A day's notice, that's all it took to cast them out, adrift in a sea of poverty.  \n\nNo laws to shield them, no hand to lift them. Unions, they promised help, but proved to be wolves in sheep's clothing, leeches feeding on the misery they claimed to fight.\n\nPackingtown, it was a cage, a prison of brick and steel. The workers, they were slaves in a gilded cage, their lives consumed by the insatiable hunger of the machine.  They toiled, they suffered, they died, all for the sake of the owners' insatiable desire for more.  \n\nSinclair, he saw the darkness, the gnawing hunger at the heart of man.

A man obsessed with the shimmer of things, with the allure of the spectral green light across the bay. But Fitzgerald, he didn't stop there. He layered his story with shades of gray, of white, of a fading pink, each color a ghost story whispering in the dark.\n\nWhite, that spectral purity, it clung to Daisy like a shroud. White flannels, white dresses, white faces. A uniformity that suffocated the soul. Like the endless expanse of the city, cold and sterile. Gray, it seeped into the edges of things, the forgotten faces in the crowd, the names scrawled on Nick’s timetable. A dull ache of emptiness, the weight of forgotten dreams.\n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of these colors. He used them to tell a story of a man chasing a ghost, a phantom of a love lost in the bleak landscape of the past. Daisy, she was the epitome of this white-washed illusion, a beautiful shell, empty and hollow. And Gatsby, he was the fool who chased the mirage, a man consumed by the grayness, the endless pursuit of an unattainable dream.",
            "The land sits heavy, a sun-baked weight in the San Diego hills.  A hundred and sixty acres of chaparral, brush choked with the ghosts of forgotten ranch hands and the whispers of a time before man. Tomatoes and lemons, they call it a bounty, but the land knows other truths.  There's a hunger here, a gnawing in the dust, that can't be fed by the sun alone. \n\nThe oaks stand sentinel, their gnarled limbs clawing at a sky bleached white by the endless sun.  The air hangs thick with the scent of sage and dust, a shroud over the bones of this forgotten place.  They say the earth remembers.  And this land, it remembers the rasp of hoof on parched earth, the crackle of a flint fire, the slow, steady pulse of a life lived closer to the marrow.\n\nThey talk of organic, of a market hungry for the purity of the soil, the unsullied taste of a tomato kissed by the sun.  But the money, it's a fickle thing, doesn't come easy in these parts. The whispers in the wind speak of a different kind of wealth, the wealth of the wild, the whispers of a kangaroo rat darting through the brush, the mournful call of a frog lost in the twilight.\n\nThere's a plan, they say, a blueprint for salvation.  A web spun to protect the creatures of this forgotten land, to thread them back into the tapestry of life. But words on paper are brittle things, easily torn by the harsh winds of reality.\n\nThis land, it holds its secrets close, buried beneath layers of dust and time. It craves a different kind of stewardship, a touch that doesn't seek to exploit, but to understand, to listen to the whispers of the wind and the rustle of the sage.  The true wealth lies not in profit, but in the quiet communion with the earth, in the dance of life and death under the relentless gaze of the sun.",
            "The wind folded across the table, a silent thing, carrying with it the dust of a thousand reckonings.  Culture, it whispered, a scalpel carving through bone and sinew, a blade that could break or build a man. It weren't some static thing, some painted signpost on the road. It was the hollowness in a man’s eye, the way he held his hand, the story etched in the lines of his face.  You couldn't squeeze it into a box, label it and hang it on a wall.  To say \"all Russians were stubborn\" or \"all Japanese accommodating\" was to spit on the wind, a truth as fleeting as smoke. \n\nIt was the unspoken things that mattered. The weight of history in a handshake. The way a silence stretched, thick and heavy, between two men.  It was in the way a man's eyes held yours, searching, measuring, seeing not just your face but the ghost of your soul. \n\nYou approached a foreign land, a foreign culture, with your own baggage, your own ghosts. You saw it through the lens of your own experience, but that was a flawed lens, cracked and stained. It was a dance, a delicate balance of respect and mistrust. You had to learn their language, not just the words, but the silences between them, the unspoken rules, the hidden meanings.  You had to understand their gods, their demons, their fears. \n\nAnd you had to be willing to let go of your own.",
            "The fool, the Psalm says, he's said it in his heart: \"There is no God.\"  That's where Anselm starts, with that empty space, that echoing silence where God ought to be. And Aquinas, too, he sees that same emptiness, though he sets about filling it not with faith, but with reason.  They both aim for the same target, this God of the Bible, this God of the Book, and the question hangs: who hits the bullseye?  \n\nBut first, a reckoning. To compare their shots, we have to assume they both believe in the same target.  A God shaped by scripture, a God with the attributes laid out in those ancient pages. Anything else, any other God, would be a phantom, a shadow in the distance, not worthy of this kind of scrutiny. \n\nAnselm, he speaks of God as something already known, a truth nestled deep in the mind.  He says, look within, and you'll find him. This is a God not of the stars or the stones, but of the soul, a God glimpsed in the quiet spaces between thought and feeling.  He calls it faith, this knowing without proof, this acceptance of the unseen.  \n\nAquinas, he wants something more solid, something you can touch, something that doesn't rely on whispers in the dark.  He builds his case on five pillars: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony.  Each one, a brick in the wall, a step towards proving God's existence through logic, through the observable world. No need for blind leaps, no need for faith. Just reason, pure and simple.\n\nBut both men, they wrestle with the same question, the same fundamental mystery.  And neither, perhaps, provides a final answer.  Anselm's God is a whisper in the soul, a truth too vast to grasp with the mind alone.  Aquinas' God is a construct, a masterpiece of logic, but is it enough to satisfy the human heart?",

A name that would echo through the years, a whisper on the wind. He cast aside the trappings of kingship, sought solace in the quiet spaces between breaths. His words, they became the bedrock of a faith. Theravada, they called it, the oldest, truest path. Twenty-five hundred years, the sun has risen and set on its tenets. Yet, the world shifts, the light changes.\n\nEven in the land of Lanka, where the waters are cut each year in a silent ceremony, a ritual born not of Buddha's own tongue, but of time and circumstance. Monks and laymen alike, they gather, a river of devotion flowing in a current not hewn by the Buddha himself. The differences, they seep into the very marrow of the faith. From the outward forms, to the heart of what it means to be free.\n\nTo understand this, we must speak of forces. Internal and external. The whispers of dissent within the fold, the echoes of change from outside its walls. Hostile forces, they seek to wound, to diminish. Benign, they tread lightly, unaware of the ripples they cast.\n\nThe core of Theravada, it lies in the refuge of the triple gem. The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the spoken word, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma. Metaphysics, the nature of reality, the dance between impermanence and suffering. Anatta, the absence of a permanent self. Dukkha, the inherent pain of existence. Anicca, the constant flux of all things.\n\nThe cycle of birth and death, Sansara, it grinds on. Fueled by lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion. But through understanding, through the four noble truths, we can break free. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Samudaya, the cause of suffering, attachment. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering. Magga, the path to liberation. The eightfold path, a map to navigate the treacherous terrain of the mind.\n\nThese are the seeds planted by the Buddha. They have taken root in the fertile ground of countless hearts. But the wind of change blows, and the landscape shifts.",
            "The land to the south, it bled. An old wound, festering for nigh on sixty years. The Mexicans and the Americans, locked in a dance of hatred and hunger, from the year of the Alamo's fall to the dawn of the new century.  They drank from the same cup, but each held it with a hand stained with blood. \n\nThe war, that was its high tide. A storm of steel and fire, swallowing land and lives.  Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed whole by the belly of the American beast. But the hunger didn't end there. Disputes, skirmishes, whispers of war on the wind, they followed like a shroud.  \n\nBorder towns bled, lawless places where men walked with the scent of gunpowder on their breath and the ghosts of vengeance in their eyes. A tangled knot of religion, culture, and greed, drawn tight by the lines on a map.  The Americans, they saw their own god in their borders, a god with an insatiable appetite.  The Mexicans, they clung to their faith, their heritage, their land, a bulwark against the tide.  \n\nLike two wolves circling a lone carcass, the nations snarled and spat.  The Americans, they looked south and saw opportunity, a land ripe for the taking.  The Mexicans, they looked north and saw a predator, its eyes fixed on their flesh.\n\nPletcher, he wrote about this, about Mexico and Cuba, two specters haunting the American dream.  He saw the same hunger in their eyes, the same thirst for power. A thirst that could never be quenched.\n\nAnd the dust, the endless dust, it settled on their bones, a testament to the price of rivalry. The soil of the Southwest, red with the blood of heroes and outlaws, a silent witness to a war that never truly ended.",
            "The sickness came on like a thief in the night, fifteen years gone now. Took hold of a nurse, the sort of woman who’d always believed in the certainties of sickness and healing. “Always work,” they’d told her, “always a need.” So she’d traded dreams of science and stories for the sterile hum of the hospital. But dreams can desert a man, even in broad daylight. \n\nForty-six, alone, and the world gone gray.  No savings, no safety net, only the gnawing certainty of empty cupboards and a body that betrayed her. Fifteen years on the bones of Social Security,  barely scraping by.  Nothing left but the hollow whisper of what might have been. Every day a struggle, a whisper of doubt echoing in the silence. Nothing certain anymore.  \n\nExcept this:  she wouldn’t have made it without the ghosts of her kin, the few true friends scattered like embers in the wind. Strong?  A laugh rattling in the throat when disaster knocks. The world cracks, and you feel the tremor in your own bones. \n\nBig government, they say, the answer to everything. But the mortar cracks, the walls crumble, and you’re left with the echo of its promises. Better, she thought, to look to the faces around you,  the hands that offer warmth.  To learn the language of asking, of sharing the burden.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism, the soul of this country.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn't traverse the wilderness alone. They shared the burden, the fear, the hope. Compassion, respect, those were the tools that built this land, not the iron fist of self-reliance.\n\nPrepare, yes, be ready. A kit, candles, and a whispered prayer for strength. Preserve the harvest, learn the language of the earth. But more than that, learn the language of your neighbor.  Build bridges, not walls. For when the wind blows cold, it's the warmth of another soul that will keep you from freezing.",
            "The question of why organisms take the forms they do, why evolution bends one way or another, has haunted thinkers for generations.  Even now, as we wield the tools of mathematics, we're only beginning to glimpse the intricate dance of form and function.  As D’Arcy Thompson wrote in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  He might say the same today. Yet, in recent years, we've begun to see how math can illuminate the grand story of life. We've used it to map the growth and lineage of mollusks, their shells whispering secrets of time and change (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own work seeks to unravel the mysteries of evolution in a small group of snails called Prunum. \n\nImagine a shell, a spiral journey through space and time. Each loop, a whorl, encircling a central column, the columella. The speed of this spiral, the size of each whorl, the delicate suture that marks their boundaries – these are the threads that weave the tapestry of form. We use X-rays to capture the geometry of these shells, to translate the whispers of bone into the language of numbers.  We feed these numbers into powerful computers, crafting models to explore the vast possibilities of shell shape. What are the limits of change? What forces drive evolution?\n\nAnd then we turn to the living world, to experiments and observations, to see how our models match the reality of Prunum. A shell is more than just a pretty thing; it’s a chronicle of growth, a record of the journey through time. We seek to read this chronicle, to understand the forces that shaped it, and to unravel the grand narrative of life etched in stone.",
            "The dead hung heavy in the air, a stillness settling over Indonesia's children.  The numbers, they told a story of a slow bleed. Ten years, and the toll on the young remained a stagnant pool.  The world cried out for progress, for the Millennium's promises to bloom, but the blossoms here wilted. Water and sanitation, they'd reached for those stars, but the children, the mothers, they were left in the shadows, clinging to a dwindling hope.\n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, seventy-two percent they said. But a midwife's hand, though gentle, can't mend a broken moon.  Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the dead of night, and those numbers, they whispered of a system failing, not a victory.\n\nDiarrhea, the children's scourge, claimed its share, and the seeking of help, it dwindled.  Post-natal care, a ghost in the night, its absence a heavy shroud.\n\nThe steel kiss of the surgeon's blade, a cesarean, a rare bloom at four percent.  But the city's light, it held the promise, seven percent, while the villages, shrouded in darkness, clung to a meager two.  A chasm yawned between them, a gulf of access, a testament to a system that favored the fortunate few.\n\nThe poorest, they reached out with empty hands, a twenty-seven percent gap, a silent scream lost in the din of indifference.  Their burdens weighed heavy, out-of-pocket costs, a wall of stone, barring them from the sanctuary of care.\n\nThe question hung in the air, a shroud of despair:  should they patch the holes, program by program, or build a bridge, a sturdy foundation for a system whole?  The allure of quick fixes, of targeted interventions, it was strong.  But the siren song of progress often drowned out the whispers of long-term gain.\n\nResources, they were fleeting, diverted like water seeking the lowest ground.  And the human heart, it too, followed the lure of abundance, leaving behind the neglected fields of care.  Duplication, a shadow twin, stalked the corridors of aid, a web of paperwork, a testament to a system that had forgotten the art of simple compassion.\n\nThe dead, they watched, their silence a stark reminder.  The children, they waited, their hope a fragile candle in the wind.  The question remained, unanswered:  would they build a system worthy of their lives?",
            "The shadow of Victorian convention fell long over the literature of the time, its tendrils reaching into every corner, every detail a testament to the grandeur and despair of the aristocracy. Yet, even in the heart of this gilded cage, two novels dared to break free, to burrow beneath the surface, to whisper of secrets and shadows. \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" – tales spun not from silk and satin but from the grit and grime of the human soul. \n\nThey are haunted by a strange and unsettling mystery, a flicker of the bizarre that shimmers beneath the surface of polite society. This darkness, this deviant whisper, serves to amplify the characters, to expose the raw nerves beneath their skin, laying bare the tangled knots of their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels weave their mysteries into the fabric of dreams, weaving tapestries of the subconscious, where reality bends and breaks. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these visions are a window into Oliver's soul, a reflection of his pain, his confusion, his growing awareness of the darkness that surrounds him.  The shooting that haunts him, revisited in a dreamlike haze, is a wound that refuses to heal.  He relives it, trapped in a maelstrom of senses, the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away a chilling reminder of his lack of control. The pain is not singular, but a constant ache, a throbbing reminder of his vulnerability. The question lingers: whose will brought about this misfortune? Is it his own, or is he a pawn in a larger, more sinister game?  \n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" the dreamlike quality takes on a more spectral form, a haunting presence that lingers at the edges of perception. Night, in its \"dreadful silence\" and \"fleeting hours,\" becomes a canvas for unspoken desires and buried secrets.\n\nThe very essence of these novels lies in their ability to transcend the conventions of their time. They dare to explore the dark corners of the human heart, to expose the fragility of innocence, the corrosive power of love and revenge. They are testaments to the enduring power of storytelling, to the human need to confront the shadows within.",
            "The air in the room hung thick with dust motes, each one a miniature sun caught in the weak rays slanting through the grimy windows.  The boy, no more than a wisp of a thing, sat hunched over a worn page, the words swimming before his eyes like drowned things. A whisper of a sigh escaped his lips. He was lost, adrift in a sea of letters that held no meaning. \n\nI’d seen it before, this look of bewilderment, this struggle against a language that felt as foreign as any tongue spoken on a distant shore. Adrian, they called him. A name like a melody in a language I barely understood. He spoke English, sure, but in that way a bird might mimic human speech – a shadow of the real thing.  It wasn’t until his mother came, her face etched with worry lines and her eyes filled with a silent plea, that the truth dawned on me.  \n\nShe spoke no English, only the guttural cadences of her native tongue. We exchanged words, fractured and halting, like two ships passing in the night, each searching for a common harbor. And then it hit me, a stark revelation in the dusty afternoon light: Adrian wasn’t failing to read, he was failing to decipher a foreign script. He knew the sounds, the rhythms, but not the code, the map that unlocked the secrets of the letters.\n\nIt was a simple truth, hidden in plain sight. And in that moment, I knew I had to help.  It wasn't a solution as grand as a restructuring of the entire educational system, nor a magical elixir to erase the language barrier. It was a one-on-one battle, a slow and careful teaching of the alphabet, of the sounds that formed words, of the stories that lay embedded in the spaces between those letters.\n\nAdrian’s struggle, I realized, was a reflection of a larger truth.  Here, in this land woven with the threads of a thousand languages, we face a challenge not of weakness, but of understanding. The path forward is not a single road, but a winding path through a thousand valleys, each one demanding a different approach, a different bridge to be built. Dual language programs, immersion, tutors, ESL classes — these are not competing forces, but threads in a tapestry, each one contributing to the whole.\n\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in the recognition that language is not merely a tool for communication, but a gateway to understanding, a portal to the soul. Whether it’s the lilting cadences of Spanish, the guttural rasp of Arabic, or the crisp pronouncements of English, each language carries within it a universe of stories, of history, of human experience. \n\nAnd to deny a child the opportunity to unlock those universes, to navigate those landscapes of words, is to deny them a part of their heritage, a part of their humanity.",
            "The rain fell hard against the tin roof, drumming a steady rhythm like the blood in a dead man's ears. He sat on the porch, a cigarette burning in his hand, the smoke twisting into the grey air. His father, skin stretched thin over bone, stared out at the yard, the rain blurring the edges of the world.\n\n\"What's your favorite bird?\" he'd asked, voice raspy, like dry leaves skittering across gravel.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" the old man said, eyes still fixed on the downpour.  He didn't turn, didn't look at him. \n\nThey sat in silence, the only sound the rain and the rasp of his father's breath.  \n\nThey were both haunted by something, something bigger than themselves, bigger than words.  Some folks called it God.  Others, ghosts.  He knew his father hadn't spoken of it in years.  He'd tried to find answers, to fill the void with something else.  Church, books, fleeting love affairs.  Nothing stuck. He was a hollow man, searching for something to hold onto in a world that didn't seem to care.\n\nHis father's hand, thin as a willow branch, reached out and rested on his knee. It was a gesture of comfort, of connection, fleeting as a butterfly's wing.  \n\n\"There's a darkness out there,\" his father said, his voice barely a whisper.  \"It's always been there.  But sometimes, it's closer.\"\n\nThe rain fell harder, the wind picking up, whipping the leaves against the old house.  \n\nThe old man's hand tightened on his knee, his grip fading like a dying ember. \n\n\nHe knew then that the darkness was closer now. \n\nHe'd asked his father about God, about the meaning of it all, but the answers had always been elusive, shrouded in the same fog that now hung over his soul.  Now, he understood.  There were some things you didn't ask.  Some questions best left unanswered.\n\n\n\nThe phone call came in December. Five days after his birthday. The doctor's voice, flat and clinical, told him the fight was over. His father was gone.\n\nHe didn't go to the funeral. Couldn't.  He couldn't bear to see the empty chair, the vacant space where his father's spirit had once resided.",
            "The notion of the Gothic novel is, in its essence and its name, a contradiction, a paradox of “Old-New,” as Ian Watt puts it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*. This mode of storytelling has been disparaged, lauded, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its “terrible sublime” (Burke). Horace Walpole, in *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the Gothic, wove together threads of \"ancient\" romantic tales and the “new” mimicry of nature found in burgeoning novels, creating a genre unto itself, a new way of telling stories. He dubbed it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic derives its power from echoes of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even at the time of *The Castle of Otranto*'s publication, the word \"Gothic\" carried a weight, used to describe a multitude of peoples, styles, and eras. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated, a shadow of the \"modern\" advancements in society and literature. The merging of the theatricality of \"Gothic\" with the novel's form, allowing for a more intimate glimpse into the minds of its characters, is what has allowed it to endure, remaining both outdated and strangely new to readers separated from its time of origin.\n\nOne of the most persistent themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in *The Castle of Otranto*. Chivalry is particularly potent for Gothic writers because of what it represented: the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, proficient—and the perceived lack of that ideal in the society they observed (particularly by Walpole). The use of chivalric concepts and manners romanticizes the \"Gothic past\" (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism) and attempts to elevate the present. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have, consciously or unconsciously, believed that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" embodied in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals who made up his present society. This concept is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.\n\nThe reader is presented with Frederic's chivalric traits before even meeting him: \n\nThe description paints Frederic with traditional chivalric imagery; he's a prince, he's suffered, been marked by tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The road stretched ahead, a ribbon of gray dust under a sky the color of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and silent, eyes fixed on the ground. They moved through the skeletal remains of a world stripped bare, the wind a rasping sigh through the empty husks of buildings.  This was the way now, a slow procession of broken things, a symphony of loss played on the strings of a long-dead sun. \n\nSupply, they called it – the way the scattered scraps of life found their way from one hand to the next, a chain forged in necessity. It was a damn fool thing, this chain. A web spun by men who thought they could control the world, but the world had other plans. \n\nMen like Oliver, with his words about \"efficiency\" and \"customer satisfaction,\" words that echoed hollowly in this wasteland. What use were customers when the world itself was dying? What good was a well-oiled machine when the fuel was gone?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand in his, a small anchor in the swirling emptiness. There was a time, he remembered, when the world had been different. A time when the very air thrummed with possibility. A time when men built things, not just moved them. A time when there were forests, and rivers, and laughter that rang clear as a bell.\n\nHe stopped, the wind whipping at his face, the taste of dust and ash on his tongue.  He looked at the boy, his face pale against the grayness, his eyes wide with a question he wouldn't ask. \"They say,\" he said, his voice a rasp, \"that the chain won't break. That it stretches from hand to hand, from one end of the world to the other.\" \n\nHe looked out at the wasteland, at the broken, twisted remains of what had once been. \"But,\" he said, \"I think maybe it's already broken.\"",
            "The sign creaked in the wind.  A single word, scrawled in a wavering hand: \"Hitler.\" Below it, a name: \"Burma.\" The girl stood alone, a figure swallowed by the dust and the sun. Ellen Page, they called her. Juno, the picture on the screen, a name whispered in the dark.  But here, in this place where the air hung thick and the shadows stretched long, she was just a girl with a sign.\n\nBurma. A land of jade and monsoon rains, a land where the mountains bled into the sky and the river snaked through the heart of the jungle. A land ruled by men who wore shadows for clothes and fear for a crown. They came to power in the blood of a coup, a whisper in the night that choked the life from the land.\n\nThey had tried to speak. The monks, cloaked in saffron, their voices rising like a prayer against the storm. A revolution whispered in the wind, a tide of voices demanding change. The \"Saffron Revolution,\" they called it. A flicker of hope in the darkness. \n\nBut the shadows had teeth. The army came, a tide of steel and fire. They burned the temples, crushed the whispers, drowned the prayers in blood.  \n\nThe girl on the corner, her face etched with the weariness of the world, knew this story. She knew of Kenji Nagai, his camera a witness to the violence, his life snuffed out by the shadows. She knew of Colonel Hla Win, his voice a ghost from the past, whispering of bodies counted in thousands. \n\nThis was not new. It was the story of empires, the story of power, the story of men who claimed to rule in the name of God, who choked the light from the world. \n\nShe thought of Tiananmen Square, the ghosts of students and intellectuals swallowed by the smoke.  She thought of Rwanda, a genocide painted in blood and tears. She remembered Hitler, his name a hiss in the dark, a nightmare that echoed through time. \n\nThe girl with the sign felt the weight of history on her shoulders. She was a single voice in the wind, a flicker of defiance against the shadows. But even a single voice, she knew, could change the world.",
            "The man sat hunched over the worn piano, his fingers tracing the dust motes dancing in the weak, yellow light.  Duke Ellington. His name hung in the air, a ghost in the room, like the scent of pipe tobacco and the memory of a long-gone rain.  The man knew the music, every note, every inflection.  He’d heard it in the smoke-filled clubs, in the shadows of the streets, in the hollow spaces of his own heart.  Ellington’s sound, it clung to him like a shroud.  Longevity, they called it.  But it was more than that. It was a shaping, a molding of sound, of men, into something greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe piano itself, a relic from a time before the ash, whispered its own stories.  Each key a weathered finger bone, each note a sigh escaping a silenced world.  Ellington’s touch, his presence, lingered in the wood, in the ivory, in the very silence between the notes.  He’d built an orchestra, not just a band, not just a collection of sounds.  He’d built a world.\n\nThe man closed his eyes, heard the muted trumpet wail, the clarinet sing, the bass rumble like a distant storm.  He saw the faces, etched in memory, the sweat on their brows, the fire in their eyes.  They were gone now, swallowed by the dust, but their music, their spirit, lived on.\n\nEllington understood the language of the soul.  He knew how to coax it out, how to shape it, how to give it voice.  He took the rough, the broken, the forgotten, and wove it into something beautiful, something lasting.\n\nHe’d learned to make the voice itself an instrument.  A growl, a whisper, a moan, a cry.  He’d used it to tell stories, to evoke emotions, to paint pictures with sound.  The man could hear it now, in the wind whistling through the empty streets, in the crackling of the dying fire.\n\nEllington’s music was a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.  Even in the face of oblivion, of silence, of ash, the music lived on.  It was a lifeline, a beacon in the darkness, a reminder that even in the ruins, something beautiful could still be found.",
            "The want gnawed at her, a hunger never satisfied. It started young, a flicker at fourteen, a fire by seventeen. Not for things, no. This was something deeper, a longing for a touch, a connection. Boys came and went, clumsy, fumbling things, drawn to her light but never finding purchase. She watched them, this parade of would-be suitors, and wondered at their effort, their desperate need to possess. But none held her. None stirred the emptiness within.  \n\nDays at home were quiet, a tapestry woven with the gentle rhythms of her parents' lives. They were good people, their love a constant, unspoken presence.  But she, she thrummed with a different energy, a restless spirit that chafed against their calm.\n\nNot today. Today, the air hung heavy, charged with an unseen tension. A scream, sharp and sudden, shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice thin and strained.  “Mom?” she called, fear a cold fist clenching her heart.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, crumpled and pale, clutching her side. \"Ow,\" her mother gasped, each syllable a shard of pain. \"Sweetheart... hospital...\"\n\n\"Hold on, Mom, I'm getting help.\" \n\nShe lifted her mother, the weight of her a familiar comfort, and carried her to the car. The hospital reeked of antiseptic and despair, but she felt only a fierce, unyielding purpose. She deposited her mother into the waiting hands of doctors, their faces grim, their movements swift.\n\nIt was a fall, a simple misstep from a rickety stool. A vase, a foolish reach. But now, the world tilted on its axis, the certainty of their tranquil life shattered.",
            "The dust settled on a world choked by its own making.  A sun, pale and wan, hung low in a sky like old parchment. This wasn't a world of green fields and plump harvests. This was a world where the earth itself had yielded its bounty to ash. But there, amongst the ruins, a way of life clung on. A way of life measured not in calories and cholesterol, but in the slow, measured rhythm of survival. They called it the Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of the old life, a memory of sun-drenched orchards and olive groves.  Here, in this desolate landscape,  it was a testament, a defiance, a prayer against the coming night.\n\n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this \"aMed\" diet, a scorecard of sustenance in a world where hunger gnawed at the edges of every day. It meant turning to the earth, to the sturdy roots and the green shoots, to the fish that swam in the few remaining pools of water. It meant favoring the fat of the olive, the oil that seeped from the earth like a promise. And it meant turning away from the flesh of the beast, from the things that choked the air with their putrescence.  \n\nThey had followed these women, these daughters of the earth, for twenty years.  Seven thousand, almost eight thousand, souls strong. Each one a story, a testament to the enduring spirit. Each one a voice whispering against the wind, a voice that spoke of resilience, of hope, of a life lived in the face of oblivion.\n\nThe women, their hands calloused, their eyes weary, filled out their records, their voices echoing in the stillness. They spoke of their meals, their days, their lives. They spoke of their losses, their triumphs, their fears. And through it all, they spoke of the aMed diet, a beacon in the darkness, a lifeline in a sea of despair.\n\n\nThey watched, these researchers, these chroniclers of the human spirit. They saw the women age, saw their faces etched with the lines of sorrow and the wrinkles of wisdom. They saw their bodies weaken, their limbs grow frail. But they also saw something else. They saw a strength that defied the odds, a spirit that refused to be broken. They saw the aMed diet, not just as a set of dietary recommendations, but as a symbol of hope, a testament to the enduring power of the human will.\n\nAnd in the end, as the dust settled and the sun dipped below the horizon, they knew. They knew that these women, these daughters of the earth, had given them a gift. They had given them a glimpse into the heart of humanity, a glimpse into the depths of human resilience. They had shown them that even in the face of oblivion, there was beauty, there was hope, there was life.",
            "The year was 2007. A sickness came down on the land, a fever dream of paper and ink. Houses, once symbols of hope, turned brittle and hollow. The towers of commerce, once monuments to man's ambition, shuddered and cracked. Men in suits, their faces pale and slick with sweat, whispered of numbers that meant nothing and things that didn't exist.  The air itself seemed to crackle with the avarice of it all.\n\nThey called it a crisis, a financial one, but it was more than that. It was the rot at the heart of things, the festering wound of greed that had been allowed to fester for too long. The politicians, with their empty promises and their hands outstretched for more, had fanned the flames. They'd loosened the reins, let the wolves in, and now the wolves were feasting.\n\nThe banks, fattened on easy money and reckless lending, had handed out loans like candy to anyone who'd ask. They built castles on sand, mortgages to folks who couldn't afford the shoes on their feet. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those ghostly specters of government oversight, swallowed it all, repackaging the poison and selling it to anyone who'd buy.\n\nAnd the people, blinded by the glitter and the promises of easy wealth, danced on the edge of the abyss. They bought more than they could afford, houses that were cobwebs spun from air. But the air would run out, the cobwebs would unravel, and the ground would open up to swallow them whole.\n\nIt was a slow burn, a gathering storm. And then, in the dead of night, it broke. The bubble burst. The wolves howled. And the people, they screamed. The towers crumbled, the houses fell, and the wolves feasted.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where the words turn to dust and the reader's eyes glaze over. Where characters stand around swapping backstories like old rugs at a pawn shop.  Dr. Merlin, she's seen it all. She's heard the complaints, the sighs of boredom, the slams of laptop lids in frustrated retreat. \n\nExposition ain't your friend. It's the slow, creeping fog that smothers the spark of the story.  We all know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But sometimes, even veterans of the word wars stumble into the quicksand of too much telling.\n\nThink of it like this: exposition is the character standing in the middle of the dusty road, spitting out a laundry list of facts about his past instead of showing you, the reader, who he is.  He tells you he's a former soldier, a failed poet, a lover of cheap whiskey and melancholic blues. You hear the words, but you don't *feel* him. You don't see the weariness etched in his eyes, the tremor in his hand, the way his soul clings to the last embers of a long-dead dream.\n\nTake that example of the heroine, heartbroken and mourning her murdered husband.  She doesn't need to spend two pages recounting their love story. Instead, let her actions speak. Show her clutching his worn shirt, her fingers tracing the familiar scent of woodsmoke and leather. Let her gaze linger on his empty chair, her tears falling onto a half-read book.\n\nGive the reader a glimpse of their bond through stolen glances, whispered secrets, shared laughter.  Let their love story unfold in the spaces between the words, in the unspoken language of shared memories and silent grief. \n\nDon't just tell the story.

            "The flickering box in the corner spat out its news, faces washed in the pale light of the screen. A man from Ashley, Ohio, a name like a rusted hinge – Shad Hostettler – had plunged a blade into his wife.  They showed his picture, a face slack with something feral. The newsman spoke of multiples wounds, of arrest, but the details, like dust, settled quickly. Two minutes, that’s all it got. \n\nThen, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, riddled with lead in the shadows of Sharon Woods. No name, no face for the boy, just the echo of a gunshot and the swift, cold touch of a SWAT team. They said the neighborhood was “rough,” a word that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken things. \n\nA bullet hole, a ghost in the skin of a hovering metal bird, a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 whispering its death song.  A five thousand dollar reward, a desperate plea for whispers in the dark.\n\nThe weatherman, a man with slicked-back hair and a practiced smile, promised rain and heat. A tease, a distraction.\n\nThen, the robbery. A man, they said, dark-skinned, a shadow in a hoodie. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the darkness, the blackness, the weight of it all.\n\nA drug kingpin from Texas, Rene Rodriguez, a name that tasted of sin and exile. He was sentenced to “three hundred” months, a number that hung heavy in the air. Hispanic, they said, a detail that had no business there.",
            "The bond between brothers, it cuts deep. Unflinching, unyielding. A knot of things tangled tight: love, hate, envy, a touch of something mean. They see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror. A truth laid bare when the dark comes. And that truth, it comes with a price. The cost of knowing. The cost of seeing.\n\nYou can't look into a brother's eyes without seeing your own face staring back. Not the face the world sees, but the one you try to hide. The one that bleeds out in your actions, in the dust your footsteps leave behind. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk a path choked with weeds and tangled vines. The air thick with the heat of a summer that will soon turn cold. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, set by pride and shadowed by a darkness neither can name. The scorn, the fierce love, the bitter undercurrents, they all rise to the surface in the end. One brother walks away from the wreckage, the other lost to the unforgiving swamp.  \n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, the narrator. He is a boy consumed by pride, a heart hardened by a need to be seen, to be strong. He wants a companion who can keep pace, a mirror reflecting his own image back to him. But Doodle, his younger brother, is born frail, a fragile bird with wings too weak to fly. This pain, this frustration, it festers and grows. It poisons the air between them, thick as the humid summer air. \n\nThe narrator's actions, his every thought, are driven by this wounded pride. He wants Doodle to be what he is not. He wants him to be strong, to be like him. He tries to force it, to mold him into his own image. But Doodle, he is a wild thing, a fragile bloom struggling to survive in a world that seeks to crush him.\n\nAnd in the end, the swamp claims what it always claims. The fragile, the broken, the ones who cannot keep pace. The narrator, he is left with the echo of his brother's laughter, the taste of guilt on his tongue, and the knowledge that some bonds, no matter how strong, can be broken.",
            "The gray matter, it thinks. A tangle of wires and whispers, a storm of lightning in the skull. Used to be they said the mind was a wax tablet, smooth and blank. Then a scroll, a book. Now they say a machine. A damned contraption of levers and gears.  They miss the point.\n\nThe senses, they come first. Sight, sound, touch, all bleeding into the darkness.  The world, a symphony of whispers, a language of flesh and shadow.  The brain, it sorts it out.  Bottom-up, they call it. Bricks laid one by one, a tower rising in the mind. But there's a hand guiding the work. A watchful eye.\n\nTop-down they call it.  A knowingness, a darkness that sees before the light.  A knowing that the box is black, not because it is black, but because it must be. \n\nThe mind, it filters.  A sieve through which the world is poured.  The unimportant falls away, the vital clings.  A name in the roar of the crowd, a blade of grass in the dust, a truth whispered in the dark.\n\nBut what is truth?  A memory, a ghost of what was. A story told and retold, each telling a little different.  Remember, they say.  Forgetting is a wound that never heals.  But remembering, that's a kind of forgetting too.  The past, it slips through the fingers, like smoke.\n\nThe mind, it stores.  In the crevices of the brain, in the echoes of synapses.  A library of moments, a graveyard of dreams.  But even memories fade.  The book, it falls apart, the words blur.  Only shadows remain.\n\nHow is it organized?  A web, they say.  Connections, threads spun from thought to thought.  A map of the mind, a labyrinth of the soul.  But maps lie.  And souls, they are not maps.\n\nThe mind, it is a mystery.  A dark, unknowable place.  And the more we think we understand it, the more we realize how little we know.",
            "The man with eyes like old obsidian watched the smoke curl from the boy's cigarette. A pale ghost in the dusk. Huxley, he said, a name like dust on a windswept plain.  He spoke of a world gone soft, of flesh puppets dancing to the tune of progress. A world traded its soul for a cheap and fleeting pleasure.  \n\nHe tapped the worn paperback in his hand.  Brave New World. A world where they manufactured happiness, where the individual was a ghost in a machine.  They preached community but lived in cages of their own making.  \n\n\"He saw it coming,\" the man rasped, his voice a dry whisper. \"The trap, the gilded cage. The hunger for more, the endless consuming.  The machine grinding on.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, tracing the words on the faded cover.  \"They forgot what it meant to feel. To be truly alive.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the man sighed, his gaze fixed on the dying embers of their fire. \"They traded their souls for a bowl of synthetic gruel.  And Huxley, he knew the cost.\"\n\nThe wind picked up, a low moan through the skeletal trees.   \n\n\"He saw the world turning cold, abandoned by God. A graveyard of bones, built on the backs of the forgotten.\"  \n\nThe boy shivered, pulling his worn coat tighter. \n\n\"He saw us coming,\" the man said, his voice a harsh whisper. \"He saw the darkness gathering.\"  He looked at the boy, his eyes burning with a strange light. \"And he warned us.\"",
            "The dust of time clung to the bricks of this town, this University Park. Two years I'd walked these streets, four and a half semesters maybe, counting the slow bleed of days into each other. The campus sprawled like a wounded animal, its limbs stretching ever outward.  East Halls, they called it, where I'd first been caged like a youth.  A world away, it seemed, from the heart of things - Willard, a name that echoed with the ghosts of a thousand lectures, the Creamery, a monument to sweetness and regret, the new health services building, a testament to the fragility of our bodies. \n\nBack then, the land between East Halls and the rest was a wasteland, empty and untamed. Now it was choked with concrete and purpose-built dreams. A sprawling labyrinth of asphalt and brick. Getting from one place to another, it felt like traversing a continent. \n\nAn old dog, a man not much older than myself, told me a story. Said the East Halls had once been a distant outpost, separated by acres of silence.  Now, the silence was gone, replaced by the hum of progress, the clatter of hurried steps.\n\nI thought about it, about the time it took to get from one side of this campus to the other.  A walk to Willard from the east could be a pilgrimage, a test of endurance. Twenty-five minutes, maybe more. The wind a bitter slap against my face, the rain a cold shroud.\n\nA friend, a man who had learned the language of the road again after years of silence, spoke of the bicycle. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his voice weary with the wisdom of experience.\n\nHe was right. A bicycle, it is more than just a machine. It is a rebellion against the tyranny of distance, a whisper of freedom in a world that seeks to confine us.\n\nI bought one myself, a steel horse with gears that clicked like the bones of a long-dead beast.  It transformed my world.  The twenty-five-minute slog to Thomas became a five-minute sprint. A fleeting pleasure, a stolen moment of grace. \n\nBut the roads, they are not kind. Pollock Road, a ribbon of asphalt that cuts through the heart of the campus, a shortcut that feels like a hazard.  It demands attention, vigilance, a refusal to be consumed by the chaos.\n\nWalking, it is a different kind of journey. A time for reflection, for the slow unfolding of thoughts. But time is a thief, and I have little to spare.  \n\nThe bicycle, it is my salvation. My chariot of fire, my escape from the tedium of endless motion. It is a reminder that there is beauty in the mundane, that even in the heart of this sprawling, grasping city, there is still a place for the wind in our hair and the sun on our faces."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust of the road clung to my boots, a gritty echo of the wasteland. It was in the dirt, in the spines of the wind-whipped trees, that I saw it first, a truth clear and cold:  the world was broken, piece by piece, the seams splitting open. I saw it in the way folks huddled, eyes downcast, faces etched with a weariness deeper than any sun could scorch. \n\nAnd I knew then, in the marrow of my bones, that service was the only prayer left. Not the kind whispered in pews, but the kind lived out, hands calloused and worn, tending to the hurt places. This ain't no fancy notion, see. This is the gospel I preach, the creed I live by. Respect for the broken, the forgotten, the ones society casts aside. \n\nIt ain't easy, this work. It claws at you, under your skin, in the hollow places. But it's in those dark corners, where shadows gather and whispers turn to screams, that you find the truest measure of a man. It's in the eyes of a child, scared and lost, that you see the reflection of a world gone wrong.  \n\nI wasn't raised with silver spoons.  I seen folks fall, seen families crumble, seen the rot seep into the heart of things. College didn't offer answers, just more questions. But then, one day, I met a boy, scared and alone, caught in a web woven with pain. It was like a mirror, reflecting the darkness back at me.  And I knew, with a certainty that burned hotter than any sun, that this was my path.\n\nI ain't one for empty words, for promises whispered on the wind. I believe in action, in the weight of a hand reaching out, in the quiet strength of a voice saying, \"You ain't alone.\" I believe in the power of connection, of finding light in the darkest corners.",
            "The air hung heavy with the dust of a dying world. This paper wrestles with the ghosts of sleep, the demons of insomnia, as they haunt the landscapes of both body and mind. There are two maps we must follow to understand this darkness: the map of biology, charting the terrain of genes and the flesh; and the map of culture, tracing the shadows cast by society, race, and circumstance. We'll lay bare the bones of each model, examining the research they offer, the truths they illuminate, and the mysteries they leave unsaid.\n\nInsomnia, a thief in the night, steals the solace of sleep, leaving behind a hollow ache in its wake. It can be a solitary beast, a primary disorder, or a harbinger of deeper troubles, a symptom of mental anguish or the weight of physical illness. It claws its way into our lives through the Dyssomnias, the Parasomnias, and the lingering tentacles of other ailments. \n\nThe biological model, like a surgeon dissecting the human machine, probes for the roots of sleeplessness in the very fabric of our being.  It whispers of genes passed down through generations, of the rhythmic dance of neurotransmitters in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a lone sentinel guarding the gates to slumber.  There are stories, for example, of neurons bathed in the glow of orexin, their whispers controlling the flow of wakefulness and rest. Studies on mice, those creatures so often our proxies in unraveling the mysteries of life, suggest that the GABAB receptor plays a pivotal role in this dance.  When activated, it ushers in the embrace of sleep.  But what if this receptor falters, its whispers silenced, its embrace withdrawn?  Could it be that the very blueprint of our being, etched in our genes, holds the key to our sleepless nights?\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. The sociocultural model, a cartographer of human experience, reminds us that our sleep is also shaped by the world around us.  It speaks of the tapestry woven by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and the ever-shifting sands of time.  It tells us that the shadows of our past, the burdens we bear, the anxieties that gnaw at our souls, all contribute to the symphony of sleeplessness.\n\nThese two maps, the biological and the sociocultural, offer glimpses into the labyrinth of insomnia. They show us that sleep is not merely a biological imperative but a cultural construct, a delicate dance between our genes and our environment.",
            "The wind rattled the bones of the world, carrying whispers of a sound not heard but felt - a sound that lived in the marrow of things. This was the land of the unheard. Here, the silence was a living presence, a shroud wrapped tight around the ears. It was the silence of the empty road stretching into the gray dust, the silence of the wind whistling through the canyons of broken buildings, the silence of a world that had forgotten how to speak. This was Central Auditory Processing Disorder. Not a failure of the ear, but a failure of the mind to hear, a failure to make sense of the symphony of sounds.\n\nThe ears worked, but the music died in the labyrinthine halls of the brain. Words blurred, sounds tangled, and the world became a cacophony of half-heard whispers.  It was a battlefield, this place where sound went to die. The boy with the quiet eyes, the teacher saw it in his struggle, in the way he turned his head, straining to catch the lost syllables, in the way he stumbled over words like they were stones on a treacherous path.\n\nThe teacher, a weathered hand in a glove of worn leather, knew the signs. The child who seemed to be daydreaming, the one who couldn't follow directions, the one who struggled with rhyming games and word searches.  They were the echoes, the ghosts of sound, lost in the static of their own minds. \n\nThere were no tests for this, no maps to guide them through the maze. Only observation, intuition, and a desperate hope to find the missing notes, the fragments of sound that the world denied them.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, speaks of a truth: disguise, though it can weave a web of deceit for a time,  eventually unravels, leaving the wearer bare. A man or woman can lose themselves in the borrowed skin, a hollow echo of what they once were.  To shed the guise, to reclaim one's true face, is to risk the sting of exposure, the chill of alienation.  For some, the world may accept the revelation, shrug and move on. But others, their trust broken,  will recoil, their eyes filled with the ice of betrayal.\n\nThe pretense of gender, a particularly treacherous game, lays bare the heart of the matter. Why, one must ask, would a soul choose to abandon their own identity, to walk in the shadow of another?  In Viola's case, the answer lies in the harsh realities of a world hostile to women. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"  (5.1.247-249 )  A stranger in a strange land, she dons the armor of masculinity, seeking safety in a man's guise. But this protection comes at a price. The embrace of sisterhood, a lifeline for women, is severed. She walks alone.  And worse, Olivia, blinded by the mask, falls in love with the illusion, mistaking Cesario for the man he is not.  \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138)  \n\nAnd what of the unspoken desires that simmer beneath the surface? Orsino, the Duke, drawn to Cesario, cries out, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261) Is Olivia's love a reflection of her own hidden yearnings, or a mockery of societal expectations?  Twelfth Night, a mirror to the age, offers a glimpse into the complexities of the human heart, where deception can both reveal and conceal the truth.  Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a shallowness that mocks genuine love. She treats Cesario/Viola as a family member, a distant echo of the passion she once held.  \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The dust clung to everything in South West Africa, a shroud over the land that choked the sun and settled deep in the bones.  The German Reich had carved its mark on these bones too, a bloody brand seared into the flesh of the land.  They spoke of genocide, of the Ovaherero and Nama decimated, their names whispered like curses on the wind.  But empires, like men, are composed of more than nightmares.  There were others, too, those who sought knowledge, who yearned to unravel the secrets of the world.  They came to the colony, these men of learning, seeking to impose order on the chaos, to bring light to the darkness.\n\nAnd the light they brought was uneven, fractured by the harsh realities of the land and the men who ruled it. In East Africa, the Germans, like iron-wrought hands, reached out and built schools, fostering a literate generation. But here, in this desolate land, they turned their backs. The task of education, that vital spark of civilization, was left to the missionaries, frail flickering candles in the vast expanse of ignorance. \n\nThe government, its heart cold and calculating, poured its resources into educating its own, building schools for the white men who claimed ownership of this land.  The native Africans, their voices drowned out by the clatter of progress, were left to wander in the shadows.\n\nThe echoes of this neglect reverberated long after the German flag had been lowered.  While other colonies boasted of educated Africans, here, in this land of dust and despair, the majority remained untouched, shrouded in the veil of illiteracy.\n\nThis is the story of South West Africa, a story of contrasts and contradictions.  A story of a land scarred by violence and a people yearning for knowledge.  A story whispered in the wind, carried on the back of the dust.",
            "The music they called Popular, in the hundred years since its birth, had birthed so many sounds, so many names, it was like trying to catalog the stars. Rap, Rock, Country, Jazz, Folk - each a constellation in its own right, each with its own nebulae of subgenres swirling beneath. But Heavy Metal, born of the rock that came before, clawed its way up, a beast with a heart of fire and a tongue of steel. Forty years it had raged, and within that time, it had become a galaxy unto itself.\n\nIt was expressive, this metal. The darkness it wore was a cloak, a shield, but within it, a storm of emotion roiled. Joy and rage, despair and defiance, all given voice in the clang of guitars and the thunder of drums. It was diverse, too, a tapestry woven from a thousand threads. From the moment it first took hold, folks began to see the potential, the ways to twist and bend it to their will. Subgenres bloomed, each a unique flower in the metal garden, and still, the growth continued.\n\nToday, the metal landscape is a sprawling wilderness. The lines blur, the boundaries fade. So many branches, so many riffs, so many voices, it's hard to say where metal truly begins and ends. But to understand the music that fills the airwaves now, the music that seeps into your bones, you have to understand its origins. It started with a spark, a fire in the heart of rebellion, and grew into a tidal wave.\n\nMetal is a movement, not just a genre. It's a hunger for something more, a yearning for the raw, the real. More bass, more volume, more fury. Less pretense, more soul poured into every note. It's a music of grit and grind, where the musicians are masters of their instruments, their fingers dancing across strings like wraiths.\n\nAnd it's a music born of darkness, a child of the night. It's haunted by the ghosts of drugs and despair, echoes of a psychedelic era where boundaries were broken and reality itself was questioned. It has its roots in the Romantic era's obsession with the dark side of the human experience. Lyrics like those penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter\" speak to this darkness, a descent into madness, a glimpse into the abyss.\n\nThis song, with its swirling, discordant melody and its lyrics that speak of chaos and confusion, it's a harbinger of things to come. It's a bridge between the light and the darkness, a turning point in music history. The Beatles, those icons of pop, dared to explore the shadows, to confront the darkness within. They surprised the world, and in doing so, they unleashed a force that would change music forever.",
            "The canvas breathes the silence of a man's longing.  Henri Rousseau, before the world knew surreal dreamscapes, he was painting his own. The Dream, that picture from ‘10, it ain’t just a woman awestruck by some fantastical land. It’s Rousseau himself, reaching for something just out of grasp. Recognition, acceptance, the whispered praise of the art world he hungered for.  A hunger born in the heart of a man with no fancy schooling, a customs man, a gabelou they called him, toiling away till forty.  He dreamt of brushstrokes that spoke, not the gruff strokes of a man who’d seen worlds beyond canvas.\n\nHis life, it was a canvas itself. Born in Laval, his father a man of trade, he found no solace in hammers and nails.  He yearned for color, for light, for stories whispered on the wind.  Then came the deaths, the toll of loved ones, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a soul heavy with grief.  Painting, it became his refuge, a way to mend the broken pieces.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the ones who romanticized the peasant life on canvas.  He was the peasant, the man in the street, his dreams as raw and real as the paint he bled onto the cloth. He saw the world with eyes that yearned for something more, something beyond the mundane drudgery of his days.\n\nThe art world, it was a beast with sharp teeth and a hunger for the new, the different.  And Rousseau, he was a man who craved its approval. He saw the giants of the time, Matisse, Picasso, their names whispered in hushed tones, their works hung in gilded galleries. He wanted that, that recognition, that validation.\n\nBut there was a struggle within him, a battle between conformity and individuality. Should he mimic the styles he admired, the ones that pleased the critics, or should he stay true to his own vision, even if it meant remaining in the shadows?  The Dream, it was a reflection of that struggle, a woman lost in a world of her own making, searching for something, yet afraid to reach out.",
            "The world’s sharp thinkers, they say, see a kinship between good and beauty. Truth and grace, they whisper, bound by some unseen thread. Keats himself, in his ode to the Grecian urn, puts it plain: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much in this life, facts and figures, lessons hard-won. But beauty and rightness, these things, they seem to find us, not the other way around. They’re whispered in the dark, not taught in classrooms.  Both, in their way, try to name the unnameable. We study art and morals, seeking to explain what makes a song sing or an action just. But the heart of it, the core, it shimmers just beyond the reach of words.\n\nTake the Mona Lisa, for instance. We dissect her, praise her brushstrokes, her pose, the way light catches her smile. But do we truly touch the soul of that painting? No. There’s a place beneath the surface, a space where words fail and a hush falls. It’s the same with right and wrong. We build codes, pronounce judgments, but at the heart of it, there’s a feeling, a knowing that transcends the rules. Flannery O’Connor, her words like shards of glass, saw this truth:  “A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Literature, like morality, it aches with a depth that language can’t fully grasp. Wittgenstein, he understood this too, saying, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.”\n\nThis is the power of art and morality, the thing that binds them. They reach us in a way that defies logic, in a realm where feeling reigns.  McKean, he said it right, “Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”  And those values, they echo the deepest parts of ourselves, the whispers of our souls.  They are the truth, the beauty, the only things that truly matter.",
            "The land they called Germany now, it held itself up stiff and strong. A country stitched together from the shadows of the Alps in München to the stark bones of the Baltic in Kiel. One culture ran through it all, from the cobbled streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden crouched upon the Elbe. It was a culture born of many pieces, of tribes long gone, each one leaving its mark upon the land. \n\nGermania, the name itself echoed with the ghosts of those ancient peoples. Where it came from, who first spoke it, that was a question gnawed at by scholars and whispered by the wind. Tacitus, he wrote of the Tungrians, a tribe that called themselves Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls.  Caesar, the Roman, he called them “Germanus,” a word taken from the mouths of the Gauls themselves, a way to set them apart, the conquered and the unconquered. Some say it meant neighbor, in the tongue of the Gauls. Caesar, in his own words, wrote of them in the Gallic Wars, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers say it came from the spear they wielded, the ger, or perhaps from the Irish word “garim,” meaning \"to shout,\" a people known for their voices, loud and raw. The truth, like the wind, it shifts and blows, leaving only whispers in its wake.\n\nTacitus, he wrote of them as a people untouched, pure, untouched by the tide of migration. He painted a picture of a land where the sky was harsh, the land wild, and the people fierce. He wondered why anyone would leave the warmth of Rome for such a place, for Germania. A land where the wind carried the ghosts of battles long past. \n\nAnd the Romans, they came and went, taking what they could, leaving their mark on the land, but never truly settling. They traded, they fought, they took their spoils, and then they returned to their own empire, leaving the Germans to their own fate. \n\nBut the Germans, they were a people of the land, they knew it like the back of their hand. They traded their goods, their skills, and sometimes, their blood, serving in the Roman legions. They were a people woven from the threads of many stories, their past a tapestry of shadows and light, waiting to be unraveled.",
            "Downward, the stare. A blankness. Comprehension, a hard glint in the eye, but no feeling. Just the slow, methodical turning of the mind, dissecting the scene. Thoughts, fleeting shadows, flitting in and out of consciousness, never quite taking hold. A clean, cold efficiency, like a knife slicing through air. \n\nThere'd been that book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a man who knew, or thought he knew, about art. It'd promised to unlock the secrets, to teach the mind how to see. How to strip away the clutter, the overwhelming detail, and find the essence.  To see a bowl of fruit not as a bowl of fruit, but as a simple arrangement of shapes, a study in light and shadow.\n\nHe looked down at the scene before him, but the artist's frame wouldn't come.  The world was too much, too raw, too full of the things that lived and died and rotted. Picasso, Monet, the Renaissance masters, they'd all had their colors, their phases, their stories. His would be different. His would be brown. \n\nThe hand reached out, a thief in the night, grasping the implement of creation. Muscles tensed, a tremor ran through the arm, and the hand plunged into the swirling depths.  Water, clear and cold, embraced the hand, a mirror reflecting the image of a soul drowning in its own grime.  A moment of stillness, then a spasm, a flailing, a desperate attempt to make something, anything, out of the formless void. \n\nThe mop, a limp appendage held in a trembling hand, the green tie a noose around the neck.  Eyes fixed on the unholy offering, a monument to human waste, a silent scream of disgust.  A flush, a sigh, a futile attempt at purification.  The toilet paper, a flimsy shield against the horrors, wrapped around the hand like a shroud.",
            "The road bleeds young.  Takes them like a hawk in the sky, those eyes bright and eager behind the wheel.  The doctors say it's the way their brains are wired, still soft, still forming.  They call it \"risk-taking\" but it's more like a hunger, a need to be seen, to feel alive.  And the road, it just swallows them whole.\n\nThey say it's the inexperience too, the lack of miles under their belts.  They don't know the feel of the asphalt, the whispers of the wind through the trees, the way the rain can turn a highway into a river of glass.  They think they're invincible, these young drivers, until they're not.\n\nAnd they go with their peers, close huddled in the car, like lambs to the slaughter.  They laugh and they sing, oblivious to the danger.  One wrong move, one moment of distraction, and it's over.\n\nCalifornia tried to stop it, these provisional licenses, curfews, passenger limits.  But it's a band-aid on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they're not ready.  Not for the responsibility, not for the weight of the world on their shoulders.  There's a man, Zuckerman, says even eighteen is too young.  Says their brains are still learning, still forming.  That the need for thrills, the hunger for danger, it's hardwired.\n\nSo what do we do?  Push them into the fire, let them learn the hard way?  Or do we wait?  Wait until their brains are forged, until the recklessness fades, until the road no longer beckons them like a siren song?\n\nThey're coming, these young drivers, millions of them.  The Baby Boomers' children, ready to take their place on the asphalt.  And if we don't do something, if we don't protect them, if we don't teach them the respect the road demands, then the road will keep taking them.  One by one.\n\nWe need to make a stand.  We need to tell them, \"No.\"  Not yet.  Not until you're ready.",
            "The Library of Congress holds a collection of Edison's early films, ghosts flickering across time. Fifteen trick films, a history lesson in illusions, from 1895 to 1901.  I watched them, each one a whispered secret of a vanishing age.  Most clung to the old ways, bound by a poetics of artifice. \n\nTheir stage was the frame, a proscenium arch barring the way to anything else. No wandering eye of the camera, no movement beyond the rigid confines. Long shots, medium shots, that was all they knew. Like a play, the audience was meant to see it all at once, no closer, no further.  \n\nThe actors, confined by this stage, danced a slow, sideways jig. Their steps like shadows across a dusty floorboard.  In “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), they come and go, flitting across the frame like startled birds, but never truly leaving.  \n\nClose-ups, the intimate whispers of film, were absent. No probing gaze into the depths of a soul. The camera held aloof, a silent judge, seeing it all, but never truly touching.\n\nAnd the films themselves, short bursts of conjured magic, lived and died within a single shot. A minute, maybe less, a fleeting glimpse into a world constructed of smoke and mirrors.  The story, if there was one, unfolded in a quick flash, like a magician's hand, revealing a secret then whisking it away.\n\nBut there were exceptions, whispers of change in the wind. The very notion of a \"shot\" could be stretched, manipulated.  \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895)  a prime example. The severed head, a shock of darkness, appearing and disappearing, a trick played on the eye. A single “shot,” but a whisper of a thousand fragmented moments, stitched together to weave a spell.",
            "The man John Taylor,  he came from Carolina,  a man of the soil,  a farmer. But the land, it didn't just feed him, it shaped him. Shaped him into a man who spoke out,  his voice ringing with the conviction of a man who'd seen the earth bleed and the sky bleed too.  He believed in the Republic,  believed in men free to tend their own furrows,  free from the grasping tendrils of government. \n\nThis belief,  it was the seed from which all his other thoughts grew.  Sovereignty,  the Constitution,  even the courts,  all were filtered through this lens,  this agrarian vision of a world where the soil was king and the man was its steward. He saw a chance in these new United States,  a chance to build something true, something untainted by the old ways.  No ancient gods, no feudal chains, just men and the land, bound by a contract forged in the sweat of their brows. He believed in rights,  natural rights,  rights that belonged to every man simply by virtue of being born. He believed these rights were a chain,  each one linked to the others,  and if one broke,  the whole chain would snap.  And government,  it was like a hungry beast,  always ready to snatch at those chains, to pull men down from their rightful place.\n\nHe saw the good and the bad in men,  a duality woven into the fabric of their being.  He spoke of it often, this duality,  how government,  being man-made,  would inevitably reflect that duality.  He called for a government that acknowledged this truth,  a government that protected the good and contained the bad. A government that fostered the land,  protected property,  and kept greed in check. He believed a government run by men,  even the best of men, would always be susceptible to the lure of power,  that their hands would reach for more than they were given.  But he also believed that men,  in their hearts,  yearned for something more than power. They yearned for freedom,  for the chance to live their lives according to their own lights.\n\nHe was a man of the Constitution,  a strict constructionist,  believing that the government should only have the powers explicitly granted to it. Anything more,  he argued,  was a slippery slope,  a path leading to tyranny. He saw the danger in a large,  powerful Federal government,  a government that could easily become despotic,  a government that would drain the lifeblood from the land and the people. \n\nHe looked to the Declaration of Independence,  to the words that declared the United States a union of sovereign states,  and saw in it a blueprint for a government that respected the autonomy of its people. It was a government of,  by,  and for the people,  not a government that ruled over them. The government,  he believed,  was a mere servant,  a tool to be used to protect the rights of the individual,  not a master to be obeyed.",
            "The numbers in the white-light box, Figure 17, told a story. A steep drop in the third month. A kind of falling away. Disheartening, it was. Why it happened, hard to say. Winter's grip on the campus, cold and unforgiving, likely kept folks from biking or walking. December, the semester's end, a blur of deadlines and papers and packing things away. The commuter log, maybe, a thing left behind in the rush. Then the holidays, a season of lights and tinsel and a break from the grind. A long month of stillness. Classes resumed in January, but the numbers stayed low. February, a mystery.\n\nMaybe, like a fire, the project burned bright at first, then settled into embers. A natural thing. To fight that, we cooked up the Carpool Challenge, a blaze of competition in March. It worked, the numbers climbed again. But the fight, it was there. Holding onto the flame, against the seasons, against the pull of routine.\n\nThe truth is, folks love their cars. The freedom, the independence, it's woven into the fabric of things. To get them to leave it behind, you gotta offer something more. We gave out goodies, gift certificates for coffee and meals and massages, even a bookstore or two. Bigger prizes, though, might have done more. A bike, a hybrid, even a sleek electric car, that might have pulled folks in. The prizes, they stayed the same, a steady drip. But imagine, a gradual escalation. A whisper of a bike in December, then a hybrid in January, the electric car a prize for the bold in February. Maybe then the numbers wouldn't have fallen.",
            "The ticker, IHF, it whispers on the wire, a cage for a phantom.  An ETF, they call it, a security, a basket of hopes woven from the threads of a hundred companies.  Like a spider’s web, it catches the market’s fly, but with less grace, less artistry.  They say it tracks an index, mimics the dance of the market, but what market? The one where men in suits whisper numbers and fortunes are lost and found like stray dogs in the night?\n\nThis IHF, it promises diversification, a shield against the storm.  But is it a shield or a shroud? It offers the liquidity of a single stock, the bite of a quick trade, the comfort of owning a sliver of a thousand dreams.

An island north, they said, beyond the known world, where the Greeks had set its edge. But the whispers of a darker source, a Germanic one, echo in the shadows. Poe, a man steeped in the lore of the Germans, a kinship with their words and their ways.\n\nSome say he was a student of Goethe, a shadow walker in the woods of his imagination. Karl J. Arndt, a scholar of the inkwell, sees the kinship in the lines of Poe’s “Politian” and Goethe’s “Mignon,” a weaving of echoes and similarities.\n\nGoethe, the master of words, the weaver of “Faust,” a tale spun in two parts, darkness and light. In the second, a poem called “The King of Thulé.” A king, bereft of his queen, drinks deep from a goblet gifted by her hand. Grief consumes him, a slow tide pulling him under. He, too, seeks the edge of the world, a cliff overlooking the sea. He casts the goblet, a symbol of his loss, into the waves, closes his eyes, and joins the darkness.\n\nPoe’s “Dream-Land,” a landscape of shadows, a king haunted by the ghosts of his past, a world drained of color, of joy. One might see in this king a reflection of Poe himself, a doppelganger, a mirror held up to his own sorrow, his own escape into the bottle. And the words “Thulé,” echoed in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” like a whispered warning from the abyss.\n\nThulé, a bookend in Poe’s poem, a haunting refrain. A land of dreams, a place of loss, a path to the edge. \n\nPoe, a man who walked in the shadows, who knew the heart of darkness, who found solace in the company of ghosts.

            "The law in this here California, it says a customer can get more than just pocket change if they fall and break their bones over a spilled applesauce.  It speaks of 'punitive damages' - a fancy name for making the store pay extra, real extra, for being careless. But to get those, the customer, Miss Palmer, she gotta prove the store manager, Mr. Martin, didn't just make a mistake, he was downright mean.  \n\nNow, a judge ain't gonna toss this claim out quick, not on account of a spill and a broken back. To get those punitive damages, Miss Palmer gotta show that Mr. Martin knew good and well that not cleanin' up that mess could hurt somebody, but he done it anyway, on purpose. Like he was willfully blind, seein' the danger but choosin' to ignore it. \n\nSee, she's gonna say that Mr. Martin should have known better.  He'd been told about spills before - other folks had slipped and fallen. It happened more than once, in fact. Six times in the year before Miss Palmer went tumblin' down. And yet, he dismissed it, said he was too busy eatin' his dinner. \n\nNow, whether the judge sees his actions as downright despicable, that's a tougher sell. But with all those accidents, it's a story that might stick.\n\nIt all happened on a Wednesday, October 13th, 5:00 p.m. Rich Wayne, a fella workin' at the store, told Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill.  Mr. Martin, he just said, \"Dinner break, gotta eat.\" Then, 15 minutes later, Mary Haddigan, another employee, gave him the same heads-up, same answer. \n\nAnd then, at half past five, Miss Palmer came along, slipped, and went down hard.  Back cracked.  Now she's suing the store for all the pain and heartache, and maybe even some extra punishment, for the store's careless ways.",
            "The dust of four years settled on the classroom, the air still thick with the heat of debate.  Islam. The word itself hung heavy, a question mark in the air. Was it a religion of peace, or a wellspring of violence? The question, it seemed, only deepened in the wake of the falling towers, a knife twisting in the gut of a nation. The airwaves, once choked with suspicion, now whispered of tolerance, of understanding. A black man named Obama, with a name that tasted of the East, rose to the highest office. A world turned, it seemed, on its axis.\n\nThe Prophet's story, though, that was a different beast. It clung to me, a whisper in the dark. The man I'd imagined, the sword-wielding conqueror, the one who forced his faith upon the world, was gone. In his place stood a figure of meekness, a martyr misunderstood, drawing people to him like moths to a flame. A whisper of doubt flickered. Was this the truth, or a carefully crafted image?\n\nThe parallels with the life of Jesus, they haunted me. The loaves and fishes, multiplied on command, echoed through the ages, a story spun for both.  Was this a subtle theft, a borrowing of divinity, a way to elevate Muhammad to the same plane as Christ? The thought sat like a stone in my stomach. \n\nThen there were the stories, whispered from one man to another, each retelling a blur of hearsay.  These were supposed to be testaments, proof of the Prophet's truth, but they felt hollow, lacking the weight of direct experience.  \n\nBut the thing that gnawed at me the most was the portrait they painted of Muhammad.  A gentle soul, wise and humble, a beacon of light. History, though, whispered a different tale, a story of conquest and violence.  A man, perhaps, who used his faith to build an empire.  Did the faithful know this history?  Or had they chosen to embrace a myth, a carefully curated image of their prophet?",
            "The dust of the world settled on the bones of what Jesus preached.  His voice, once a clarion call, faded to a whisper in the wind of time.  Christianity, born in his image,  grew, twisted, and spread, a vine choking the saplings of his original intent.  The world turned, a wheel ever grinding, and the light of progress cast long shadows on the past.\n\nOld ways clung to the bones of men, resistant to the wind of change. But the tide was turning.  A hunger stirred, a yearning for something lost.  A thirst for the pure spring of Jesus' words, unmuddied by the centuries of accretion.\n\nLike a slow, inexorable flood, this yearning would rise.  It would wash over the land, erasing the mortar of dogma, stone by stone, layer by layer.  The churches, those grand monuments to tradition, would stand watch as the tide receded, revealing a truth buried beneath the silt of time.\n\nA new dawn would break, a return to the source.  A world where the echoes of Jesus' voice rang clear, unburdened by the weight of centuries.  The churches, though still standing, would become vessels for this new understanding, their sermons echoing the simplicity of the original message.\n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the faithful would gather, not as denominations, but as a single, unified voice.  Differences would dissolve, replaced by a shared understanding, a common ground forged in the crucible of history.\n\nHistory itself seemed to turn in cycles, a slow, relentless dance of progress and regress.  Like the Roman Empire, once the persecutor, now the convert, the world would turn again.  The chains of the past would loosen, the shackles of tradition would fall away, and the world would be reborn in the image of the carpenter's son.  The path to this future was paved with a single, unwavering truth: a willingness to see Jesus' words not as literal pronouncements, but as a timeless reflection of the human spirit.\n\nAnd then, as always, there was the beginning, the source, the echo that resonated through the ages.  Judaism, the wellspring of faith, where monotheism took root, where the scriptures whispered promises of a coming savior.",
            "The smoke, it rose black against the sky like a shroud.  The factories, they breathed it out, this river of soot, staining the world with the greed that fueled them. Men, they craved only more, always more, and they'd grind the life out of anything to get it. The owners, they saw the workers not as men, but as cogs, expendable parts in a machine built only for profit. \n\nSinclair, he saw it. He painted a picture of Packingtown, a place where the stench of blood and decay hung thick in the air.  A place where men, their bodies broken and spirits crushed, toiled for scraps of their lives.  The line between man and beast blurred in those factories, a butcher's shop more than a place of work.\n\nThe men, they worked till they bled, till their hands were raw and their backs bent double.  For what? A pittance, a cruel joke in the face of the wealth the owners amassed.  A day's notice, that's all it took to cast them out, adrift in a sea of poverty.  \n\nNo laws to shield them, no hand to lift them. Unions, they promised help, but proved to be wolves in sheep's clothing, leeches feeding on the misery they claimed to fight.\n\nPackingtown, it was a cage, a prison of brick and steel. The workers, they were slaves in a gilded cage, their lives consumed by the insatiable hunger of the machine.  They toiled, they suffered, they died, all for the sake of the owners' insatiable desire for more.  \n\nSinclair, he saw the darkness, the gnawing hunger at the heart of man. He showed the world the beast within, the beast that feasts on the weak and spits on the fallen.",
            "The world of men, it’s painted in colors, each shade a whispered truth. Fitzgerald, he knew this. He knew how to stain the canvas of his story with hues that bled into the reader’s soul, leaving a taste of ash and regret on the tongue. Take his Gatsby. A man obsessed with the shimmer of things, with the allure of the spectral green light across the bay. But Fitzgerald, he didn't stop there. He layered his story with shades of gray, of white, of a fading pink, each color a ghost story whispering in the dark.\n\nWhite, that spectral purity, it clung to Daisy like a shroud. White flannels, white dresses, white faces. A uniformity that suffocated the soul. Like the endless expanse of the city, cold and sterile. Gray, it seeped into the edges of things, the forgotten faces in the crowd, the names scrawled on Nick’s timetable. A dull ache of emptiness, the weight of forgotten dreams.\n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of these colors. He used them to tell a story of a man chasing a ghost, a phantom of a love lost in the bleak landscape of the past. Daisy, she was the epitome of this white-washed illusion, a beautiful shell, empty and hollow. And Gatsby, he was the fool who chased the mirage, a man consumed by the grayness, the endless pursuit of an unattainable dream.",
            "The land sits heavy, a sun-baked weight in the San Diego hills.  A hundred and sixty acres of chaparral, brush choked with the ghosts of forgotten ranch hands and the whispers of a time before man. Tomatoes and lemons, they call it a bounty, but the land knows other truths.  There's a hunger here, a gnawing in the dust, that can't be fed by the sun alone. \n\nThe oaks stand sentinel, their gnarled limbs clawing at a sky bleached white by the endless sun.  The air hangs thick with the scent of sage and dust, a shroud over the bones of this forgotten place.  They say the earth remembers.  And this land, it remembers the rasp of hoof on parched earth, the crackle of a flint fire, the slow, steady pulse of a life lived closer to the marrow.\n\nThey talk of organic, of a market hungry for the purity of the soil, the unsullied taste of a tomato kissed by the sun.  But the money, it's a fickle thing, doesn't come easy in these parts. The whispers in the wind speak of a different kind of wealth, the wealth of the wild, the whispers of a kangaroo rat darting through the brush, the mournful call of a frog lost in the twilight.\n\nThere's a plan, they say, a blueprint for salvation.  A web spun to protect the creatures of this forgotten land, to thread them back into the tapestry of life. But words on paper are brittle things, easily torn by the harsh winds of reality.\n\nThis land, it holds its secrets close, buried beneath layers of dust and time. It craves a different kind of stewardship, a touch that doesn't seek to exploit, but to understand, to listen to the whispers of the wind and the rustle of the sage.  The true wealth lies not in profit, but in the quiet communion with the earth, in the dance of life and death under the relentless gaze of the sun.",
            "The wind folded across the table, a silent thing, carrying with it the dust of a thousand reckonings.  Culture, it whispered, a scalpel carving through bone and sinew, a blade that could break or build a man. It weren't some static thing, some painted signpost on the road. It was the hollowness in a man’s eye, the way he held his hand, the story etched in the lines of his face.  You couldn't squeeze it into a box, label it and hang it on a wall.  To say \"all Russians were stubborn\" or \"all Japanese accommodating\" was to spit on the wind, a truth as fleeting as smoke. \n\nIt was the unspoken things that mattered. The weight of history in a handshake. The way a silence stretched, thick and heavy, between two men.  It was in the way a man's eyes held yours, searching, measuring, seeing not just your face but the ghost of your soul. \n\nYou approached a foreign land, a foreign culture, with your own baggage, your own ghosts. You saw it through the lens of your own experience, but that was a flawed lens, cracked and stained. It was a dance, a delicate balance of respect and mistrust. You had to learn their language, not just the words, but the silences between them, the unspoken rules, the hidden meanings.  You had to understand their gods, their demons, their fears. \n\nAnd you had to be willing to let go of your own.",
            "The fool, the Psalm says, he's said it in his heart: \"There is no God.\"  That's where Anselm starts, with that empty space, that echoing silence where God ought to be. And Aquinas, too, he sees that same emptiness, though he sets about filling it not with faith, but with reason.  They both aim for the same target, this God of the Bible, this God of the Book, and the question hangs: who hits the bullseye?  \n\nBut first, a reckoning. To compare their shots, we have to assume they both believe in the same target.  A God shaped by scripture, a God with the attributes laid out in those ancient pages. Anything else, any other God, would be a phantom, a shadow in the distance, not worthy of this kind of scrutiny. \n\nAnselm, he speaks of God as something already known, a truth nestled deep in the mind.  He says, look within, and you'll find him. This is a God not of the stars or the stones, but of the soul, a God glimpsed in the quiet spaces between thought and feeling.  He calls it faith, this knowing without proof, this acceptance of the unseen.  \n\nAquinas, he wants something more solid, something you can touch, something that doesn't rely on whispers in the dark.  He builds his case on five pillars: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony.  Each one, a brick in the wall, a step towards proving God's existence through logic, through the observable world. No need for blind leaps, no need for faith. Just reason, pure and simple.\n\nBut both men, they wrestle with the same question, the same fundamental mystery.  And neither, perhaps, provides a final answer.  Anselm's God is a whisper in the soul, a truth too vast to grasp with the mind alone.  Aquinas' God is a construct, a masterpiece of logic, but is it enough to satisfy the human heart?",
            "The dust of ages, it clung thick to the bones of the world. A prince, they called him. Born in the shadow of the fifth century, a man marked for something more. Buddha. A name that would echo through the years, a whisper on the wind. He cast aside the trappings of kingship, sought solace in the quiet spaces between breaths. His words, they became the bedrock of a faith. Theravada, they called it, the oldest, truest path. Twenty-five hundred years, the sun has risen and set on its tenets. Yet, the world shifts, the light changes.\n\nEven in the land of Lanka, where the waters are cut each year in a silent ceremony, a ritual born not of Buddha's own tongue, but of time and circumstance. Monks and laymen alike, they gather, a river of devotion flowing in a current not hewn by the Buddha himself. The differences, they seep into the very marrow of the faith. From the outward forms, to the heart of what it means to be free.\n\nTo understand this, we must speak of forces. Internal and external. The whispers of dissent within the fold, the echoes of change from outside its walls. Hostile forces, they seek to wound, to diminish. Benign, they tread lightly, unaware of the ripples they cast.\n\nThe core of Theravada, it lies in the refuge of the triple gem. The Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the spoken word, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma. Metaphysics, the nature of reality, the dance between impermanence and suffering. Anatta, the absence of a permanent self. Dukkha, the inherent pain of existence. Anicca, the constant flux of all things.\n\nThe cycle of birth and death, Sansara, it grinds on. Fueled by lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion. But through understanding, through the four noble truths, we can break free. Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Samudaya, the cause of suffering, attachment. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering. Magga, the path to liberation. The eightfold path, a map to navigate the treacherous terrain of the mind.\n\nThese are the seeds planted by the Buddha. They have taken root in the fertile ground of countless hearts. But the wind of change blows, and the landscape shifts.",
            "The land to the south, it bled. An old wound, festering for nigh on sixty years. The Mexicans and the Americans, locked in a dance of hatred and hunger, from the year of the Alamo's fall to the dawn of the new century.  They drank from the same cup, but each held it with a hand stained with blood. \n\nThe war, that was its high tide. A storm of steel and fire, swallowing land and lives.  Texas, the Southwest, all swallowed whole by the belly of the American beast. But the hunger didn't end there. Disputes, skirmishes, whispers of war on the wind, they followed like a shroud.  \n\nBorder towns bled, lawless places where men walked with the scent of gunpowder on their breath and the ghosts of vengeance in their eyes. A tangled knot of religion, culture, and greed, drawn tight by the lines on a map.  The Americans, they saw their own god in their borders, a god with an insatiable appetite.  The Mexicans, they clung to their faith, their heritage, their land, a bulwark against the tide.  \n\nLike two wolves circling a lone carcass, the nations snarled and spat.  The Americans, they looked south and saw opportunity, a land ripe for the taking.  The Mexicans, they looked north and saw a predator, its eyes fixed on their flesh.\n\nPletcher, he wrote about this, about Mexico and Cuba, two specters haunting the American dream.  He saw the same hunger in their eyes, the same thirst for power. A thirst that could never be quenched.\n\nAnd the dust, the endless dust, it settled on their bones, a testament to the price of rivalry. The soil of the Southwest, red with the blood of heroes and outlaws, a silent witness to a war that never truly ended.",
            "The sickness came on like a thief in the night, fifteen years gone now. Took hold of a nurse, the sort of woman who’d always believed in the certainties of sickness and healing. “Always work,” they’d told her, “always a need.” So she’d traded dreams of science and stories for the sterile hum of the hospital. But dreams can desert a man, even in broad daylight. \n\nForty-six, alone, and the world gone gray.  No savings, no safety net, only the gnawing certainty of empty cupboards and a body that betrayed her. Fifteen years on the bones of Social Security,  barely scraping by.  Nothing left but the hollow whisper of what might have been. Every day a struggle, a whisper of doubt echoing in the silence. Nothing certain anymore.  \n\nExcept this:  she wouldn’t have made it without the ghosts of her kin, the few true friends scattered like embers in the wind. Strong?  A laugh rattling in the throat when disaster knocks. The world cracks, and you feel the tremor in your own bones. \n\nBig government, they say, the answer to everything. But the mortar cracks, the walls crumble, and you’re left with the echo of its promises. Better, she thought, to look to the faces around you,  the hands that offer warmth.  To learn the language of asking, of sharing the burden.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism, the soul of this country.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn't traverse the wilderness alone. They shared the burden, the fear, the hope. Compassion, respect, those were the tools that built this land, not the iron fist of self-reliance.\n\nPrepare, yes, be ready. A kit, candles, and a whispered prayer for strength. Preserve the harvest, learn the language of the earth. But more than that, learn the language of your neighbor.  Build bridges, not walls. For when the wind blows cold, it's the warmth of another soul that will keep you from freezing.",
            "The question of why organisms take the forms they do, why evolution bends one way or another, has haunted thinkers for generations.  Even now, as we wield the tools of mathematics, we're only beginning to glimpse the intricate dance of form and function.  As D’Arcy Thompson wrote in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  He might say the same today. Yet, in recent years, we've begun to see how math can illuminate the grand story of life. We've used it to map the growth and lineage of mollusks, their shells whispering secrets of time and change (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own work seeks to unravel the mysteries of evolution in a small group of snails called Prunum. \n\nImagine a shell, a spiral journey through space and time. Each loop, a whorl, encircling a central column, the columella. The speed of this spiral, the size of each whorl, the delicate suture that marks their boundaries – these are the threads that weave the tapestry of form. We use X-rays to capture the geometry of these shells, to translate the whispers of bone into the language of numbers.  We feed these numbers into powerful computers, crafting models to explore the vast possibilities of shell shape. What are the limits of change? What forces drive evolution?\n\nAnd then we turn to the living world, to experiments and observations, to see how our models match the reality of Prunum. A shell is more than just a pretty thing; it’s a chronicle of growth, a record of the journey through time. We seek to read this chronicle, to understand the forces that shaped it, and to unravel the grand narrative of life etched in stone.",
            "The dead hung heavy in the air, a stillness settling over Indonesia's children.  The numbers, they told a story of a slow bleed. Ten years, and the toll on the young remained a stagnant pool.  The world cried out for progress, for the Millennium's promises to bloom, but the blossoms here wilted. Water and sanitation, they'd reached for those stars, but the children, the mothers, they were left in the shadows, clinging to a dwindling hope.\n\nThey spoke of skilled birth attendants, seventy-two percent they said. But a midwife's hand, though gentle, can't mend a broken moon.  Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the dead of night, and those numbers, they whispered of a system failing, not a victory.\n\nDiarrhea, the children's scourge, claimed its share, and the seeking of help, it dwindled.  Post-natal care, a ghost in the night, its absence a heavy shroud.\n\nThe steel kiss of the surgeon's blade, a cesarean, a rare bloom at four percent.  But the city's light, it held the promise, seven percent, while the villages, shrouded in darkness, clung to a meager two.  A chasm yawned between them, a gulf of access, a testament to a system that favored the fortunate few.\n\nThe poorest, they reached out with empty hands, a twenty-seven percent gap, a silent scream lost in the din of indifference.  Their burdens weighed heavy, out-of-pocket costs, a wall of stone, barring them from the sanctuary of care.\n\nThe question hung in the air, a shroud of despair:  should they patch the holes, program by program, or build a bridge, a sturdy foundation for a system whole?  The allure of quick fixes, of targeted interventions, it was strong.  But the siren song of progress often drowned out the whispers of long-term gain.\n\nResources, they were fleeting, diverted like water seeking the lowest ground.  And the human heart, it too, followed the lure of abundance, leaving behind the neglected fields of care.  Duplication, a shadow twin, stalked the corridors of aid, a web of paperwork, a testament to a system that had forgotten the art of simple compassion.\n\nThe dead, they watched, their silence a stark reminder.  The children, they waited, their hope a fragile candle in the wind.  The question remained, unanswered:  would they build a system worthy of their lives?",
            "The shadow of Victorian convention fell long over the literature of the time, its tendrils reaching into every corner, every detail a testament to the grandeur and despair of the aristocracy. Yet, even in the heart of this gilded cage, two novels dared to break free, to burrow beneath the surface, to whisper of secrets and shadows. \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" – tales spun not from silk and satin but from the grit and grime of the human soul. \n\nThey are haunted by a strange and unsettling mystery, a flicker of the bizarre that shimmers beneath the surface of polite society. This darkness, this deviant whisper, serves to amplify the characters, to expose the raw nerves beneath their skin, laying bare the tangled knots of their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels weave their mysteries into the fabric of dreams, weaving tapestries of the subconscious, where reality bends and breaks. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these visions are a window into Oliver's soul, a reflection of his pain, his confusion, his growing awareness of the darkness that surrounds him.  The shooting that haunts him, revisited in a dreamlike haze, is a wound that refuses to heal.  He relives it, trapped in a maelstrom of senses, the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away a chilling reminder of his lack of control. The pain is not singular, but a constant ache, a throbbing reminder of his vulnerability. The question lingers: whose will brought about this misfortune? Is it his own, or is he a pawn in a larger, more sinister game?  \n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" the dreamlike quality takes on a more spectral form, a haunting presence that lingers at the edges of perception. Night, in its \"dreadful silence\" and \"fleeting hours,\" becomes a canvas for unspoken desires and buried secrets.\n\nThe very essence of these novels lies in their ability to transcend the conventions of their time. They dare to explore the dark corners of the human heart, to expose the fragility of innocence, the corrosive power of love and revenge. They are testaments to the enduring power of storytelling, to the human need to confront the shadows within.",
            "The air in the room hung thick with dust motes, each one a miniature sun caught in the weak rays slanting through the grimy windows.  The boy, no more than a wisp of a thing, sat hunched over a worn page, the words swimming before his eyes like drowned things. A whisper of a sigh escaped his lips. He was lost, adrift in a sea of letters that held no meaning. \n\nI’d seen it before, this look of bewilderment, this struggle against a language that felt as foreign as any tongue spoken on a distant shore. Adrian, they called him. A name like a melody in a language I barely understood. He spoke English, sure, but in that way a bird might mimic human speech – a shadow of the real thing.  It wasn’t until his mother came, her face etched with worry lines and her eyes filled with a silent plea, that the truth dawned on me.  \n\nShe spoke no English, only the guttural cadences of her native tongue. We exchanged words, fractured and halting, like two ships passing in the night, each searching for a common harbor. And then it hit me, a stark revelation in the dusty afternoon light: Adrian wasn’t failing to read, he was failing to decipher a foreign script. He knew the sounds, the rhythms, but not the code, the map that unlocked the secrets of the letters.\n\nIt was a simple truth, hidden in plain sight. And in that moment, I knew I had to help.  It wasn't a solution as grand as a restructuring of the entire educational system, nor a magical elixir to erase the language barrier. It was a one-on-one battle, a slow and careful teaching of the alphabet, of the sounds that formed words, of the stories that lay embedded in the spaces between those letters.\n\nAdrian’s struggle, I realized, was a reflection of a larger truth.  Here, in this land woven with the threads of a thousand languages, we face a challenge not of weakness, but of understanding. The path forward is not a single road, but a winding path through a thousand valleys, each one demanding a different approach, a different bridge to be built. Dual language programs, immersion, tutors, ESL classes — these are not competing forces, but threads in a tapestry, each one contributing to the whole.\n\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in the recognition that language is not merely a tool for communication, but a gateway to understanding, a portal to the soul. Whether it’s the lilting cadences of Spanish, the guttural rasp of Arabic, or the crisp pronouncements of English, each language carries within it a universe of stories, of history, of human experience. \n\nAnd to deny a child the opportunity to unlock those universes, to navigate those landscapes of words, is to deny them a part of their heritage, a part of their humanity.",
            "The rain fell hard against the tin roof, drumming a steady rhythm like the blood in a dead man's ears. He sat on the porch, a cigarette burning in his hand, the smoke twisting into the grey air. His father, skin stretched thin over bone, stared out at the yard, the rain blurring the edges of the world.\n\n\"What's your favorite bird?\" he'd asked, voice raspy, like dry leaves skittering across gravel.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" the old man said, eyes still fixed on the downpour.  He didn't turn, didn't look at him. \n\nThey sat in silence, the only sound the rain and the rasp of his father's breath.  \n\nThey were both haunted by something, something bigger than themselves, bigger than words.  Some folks called it God.  Others, ghosts.  He knew his father hadn't spoken of it in years.  He'd tried to find answers, to fill the void with something else.  Church, books, fleeting love affairs.  Nothing stuck. He was a hollow man, searching for something to hold onto in a world that didn't seem to care.\n\nHis father's hand, thin as a willow branch, reached out and rested on his knee. It was a gesture of comfort, of connection, fleeting as a butterfly's wing.  \n\n\"There's a darkness out there,\" his father said, his voice barely a whisper.  \"It's always been there.  But sometimes, it's closer.\"\n\nThe rain fell harder, the wind picking up, whipping the leaves against the old house.  \n\nThe old man's hand tightened on his knee, his grip fading like a dying ember. \n\n\nHe knew then that the darkness was closer now. \n\nHe'd asked his father about God, about the meaning of it all, but the answers had always been elusive, shrouded in the same fog that now hung over his soul.  Now, he understood.  There were some things you didn't ask.  Some questions best left unanswered.\n\n\n\nThe phone call came in December. Five days after his birthday. The doctor's voice, flat and clinical, told him the fight was over. His father was gone.\n\nHe didn't go to the funeral. Couldn't.  He couldn't bear to see the empty chair, the vacant space where his father's spirit had once resided.",
            "The notion of the Gothic novel is, in its essence and its name, a contradiction, a paradox of “Old-New,” as Ian Watt puts it in *The Rise of the Gothic Novel*. This mode of storytelling has been disparaged, lauded, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its “terrible sublime” (Burke). Horace Walpole, in *The Castle of Otranto*, the progenitor of the Gothic, wove together threads of \"ancient\" romantic tales and the “new” mimicry of nature found in burgeoning novels, creating a genre unto itself, a new way of telling stories. He dubbed it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic derives its power from echoes of medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even at the time of *The Castle of Otranto*'s publication, the word \"Gothic\" carried a weight, used to describe a multitude of peoples, styles, and eras. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated, a shadow of the \"modern\" advancements in society and literature. The merging of the theatricality of \"Gothic\" with the novel's form, allowing for a more intimate glimpse into the minds of its characters, is what has allowed it to endure, remaining both outdated and strangely new to readers separated from its time of origin.\n\nOne of the most persistent themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in *The Castle of Otranto*. Chivalry is particularly potent for Gothic writers because of what it represented: the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, proficient—and the perceived lack of that ideal in the society they observed (particularly by Walpole). The use of chivalric concepts and manners romanticizes the \"Gothic past\" (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism) and attempts to elevate the present. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have, consciously or unconsciously, believed that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" embodied in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals who made up his present society. This concept is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.\n\nThe reader is presented with Frederic's chivalric traits before even meeting him: \n\nThe description paints Frederic with traditional chivalric imagery; he's a prince, he's suffered, been marked by tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The road stretched ahead, a ribbon of gray dust under a sky the color of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and silent, eyes fixed on the ground. They moved through the skeletal remains of a world stripped bare, the wind a rasping sigh through the empty husks of buildings.  This was the way now, a slow procession of broken things, a symphony of loss played on the strings of a long-dead sun. \n\nSupply, they called it – the way the scattered scraps of life found their way from one hand to the next, a chain forged in necessity. It was a damn fool thing, this chain. A web spun by men who thought they could control the world, but the world had other plans. \n\nMen like Oliver, with his words about \"efficiency\" and \"customer satisfaction,\" words that echoed hollowly in this wasteland. What use were customers when the world itself was dying? What good was a well-oiled machine when the fuel was gone?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand in his, a small anchor in the swirling emptiness. There was a time, he remembered, when the world had been different. A time when the very air thrummed with possibility. A time when men built things, not just moved them. A time when there were forests, and rivers, and laughter that rang clear as a bell.\n\nHe stopped, the wind whipping at his face, the taste of dust and ash on his tongue.  He looked at the boy, his face pale against the grayness, his eyes wide with a question he wouldn't ask. \"They say,\" he said, his voice a rasp, \"that the chain won't break. That it stretches from hand to hand, from one end of the world to the other.\" \n\nHe looked out at the wasteland, at the broken, twisted remains of what had once been. \"But,\" he said, \"I think maybe it's already broken.\"",
            "The sign creaked in the wind.  A single word, scrawled in a wavering hand: \"Hitler.\" Below it, a name: \"Burma.\" The girl stood alone, a figure swallowed by the dust and the sun. Ellen Page, they called her. Juno, the picture on the screen, a name whispered in the dark.  But here, in this place where the air hung thick and the shadows stretched long, she was just a girl with a sign.\n\nBurma. A land of jade and monsoon rains, a land where the mountains bled into the sky and the river snaked through the heart of the jungle. A land ruled by men who wore shadows for clothes and fear for a crown. They came to power in the blood of a coup, a whisper in the night that choked the life from the land.\n\nThey had tried to speak. The monks, cloaked in saffron, their voices rising like a prayer against the storm. A revolution whispered in the wind, a tide of voices demanding change. The \"Saffron Revolution,\" they called it. A flicker of hope in the darkness. \n\nBut the shadows had teeth. The army came, a tide of steel and fire. They burned the temples, crushed the whispers, drowned the prayers in blood.  \n\nThe girl on the corner, her face etched with the weariness of the world, knew this story. She knew of Kenji Nagai, his camera a witness to the violence, his life snuffed out by the shadows. She knew of Colonel Hla Win, his voice a ghost from the past, whispering of bodies counted in thousands. \n\nThis was not new. It was the story of empires, the story of power, the story of men who claimed to rule in the name of God, who choked the light from the world. \n\nShe thought of Tiananmen Square, the ghosts of students and intellectuals swallowed by the smoke.  She thought of Rwanda, a genocide painted in blood and tears. She remembered Hitler, his name a hiss in the dark, a nightmare that echoed through time. \n\nThe girl with the sign felt the weight of history on her shoulders. She was a single voice in the wind, a flicker of defiance against the shadows. But even a single voice, she knew, could change the world.",
            "The man sat hunched over the worn piano, his fingers tracing the dust motes dancing in the weak, yellow light.  Duke Ellington. His name hung in the air, a ghost in the room, like the scent of pipe tobacco and the memory of a long-gone rain.  The man knew the music, every note, every inflection.  He’d heard it in the smoke-filled clubs, in the shadows of the streets, in the hollow spaces of his own heart.  Ellington’s sound, it clung to him like a shroud.  Longevity, they called it.  But it was more than that. It was a shaping, a molding of sound, of men, into something greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe piano itself, a relic from a time before the ash, whispered its own stories.  Each key a weathered finger bone, each note a sigh escaping a silenced world.  Ellington’s touch, his presence, lingered in the wood, in the ivory, in the very silence between the notes.  He’d built an orchestra, not just a band, not just a collection of sounds.  He’d built a world.\n\nThe man closed his eyes, heard the muted trumpet wail, the clarinet sing, the bass rumble like a distant storm.  He saw the faces, etched in memory, the sweat on their brows, the fire in their eyes.  They were gone now, swallowed by the dust, but their music, their spirit, lived on.\n\nEllington understood the language of the soul.  He knew how to coax it out, how to shape it, how to give it voice.  He took the rough, the broken, the forgotten, and wove it into something beautiful, something lasting.\n\nHe’d learned to make the voice itself an instrument.  A growl, a whisper, a moan, a cry.  He’d used it to tell stories, to evoke emotions, to paint pictures with sound.  The man could hear it now, in the wind whistling through the empty streets, in the crackling of the dying fire.\n\nEllington’s music was a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.  Even in the face of oblivion, of silence, of ash, the music lived on.  It was a lifeline, a beacon in the darkness, a reminder that even in the ruins, something beautiful could still be found.",
            "The want gnawed at her, a hunger never satisfied. It started young, a flicker at fourteen, a fire by seventeen. Not for things, no. This was something deeper, a longing for a touch, a connection. Boys came and went, clumsy, fumbling things, drawn to her light but never finding purchase. She watched them, this parade of would-be suitors, and wondered at their effort, their desperate need to possess. But none held her. None stirred the emptiness within.  \n\nDays at home were quiet, a tapestry woven with the gentle rhythms of her parents' lives. They were good people, their love a constant, unspoken presence.  But she, she thrummed with a different energy, a restless spirit that chafed against their calm.\n\nNot today. Today, the air hung heavy, charged with an unseen tension. A scream, sharp and sudden, shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice thin and strained.  “Mom?” she called, fear a cold fist clenching her heart.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, crumpled and pale, clutching her side. \"Ow,\" her mother gasped, each syllable a shard of pain. \"Sweetheart... hospital...\"\n\n\"Hold on, Mom, I'm getting help.\" \n\nShe lifted her mother, the weight of her a familiar comfort, and carried her to the car. The hospital reeked of antiseptic and despair, but she felt only a fierce, unyielding purpose. She deposited her mother into the waiting hands of doctors, their faces grim, their movements swift.\n\nIt was a fall, a simple misstep from a rickety stool. A vase, a foolish reach. But now, the world tilted on its axis, the certainty of their tranquil life shattered.",
            "The dust settled on a world choked by its own making.  A sun, pale and wan, hung low in a sky like old parchment. This wasn't a world of green fields and plump harvests. This was a world where the earth itself had yielded its bounty to ash. But there, amongst the ruins, a way of life clung on. A way of life measured not in calories and cholesterol, but in the slow, measured rhythm of survival. They called it the Mediterranean Diet, a whisper of the old life, a memory of sun-drenched orchards and olive groves.  Here, in this desolate landscape,  it was a testament, a defiance, a prayer against the coming night.\n\n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this \"aMed\" diet, a scorecard of sustenance in a world where hunger gnawed at the edges of every day. It meant turning to the earth, to the sturdy roots and the green shoots, to the fish that swam in the few remaining pools of water. It meant favoring the fat of the olive, the oil that seeped from the earth like a promise. And it meant turning away from the flesh of the beast, from the things that choked the air with their putrescence.  \n\nThey had followed these women, these daughters of the earth, for twenty years.  Seven thousand, almost eight thousand, souls strong. Each one a story, a testament to the enduring spirit. Each one a voice whispering against the wind, a voice that spoke of resilience, of hope, of a life lived in the face of oblivion.\n\nThe women, their hands calloused, their eyes weary, filled out their records, their voices echoing in the stillness. They spoke of their meals, their days, their lives. They spoke of their losses, their triumphs, their fears. And through it all, they spoke of the aMed diet, a beacon in the darkness, a lifeline in a sea of despair.\n\n\nThey watched, these researchers, these chroniclers of the human spirit. They saw the women age, saw their faces etched with the lines of sorrow and the wrinkles of wisdom. They saw their bodies weaken, their limbs grow frail. But they also saw something else. They saw a strength that defied the odds, a spirit that refused to be broken. They saw the aMed diet, not just as a set of dietary recommendations, but as a symbol of hope, a testament to the enduring power of the human will.\n\nAnd in the end, as the dust settled and the sun dipped below the horizon, they knew. They knew that these women, these daughters of the earth, had given them a gift. They had given them a glimpse into the heart of humanity, a glimpse into the depths of human resilience. They had shown them that even in the face of oblivion, there was beauty, there was hope, there was life.",
            "The year was 2007. A sickness came down on the land, a fever dream of paper and ink. Houses, once symbols of hope, turned brittle and hollow. The towers of commerce, once monuments to man's ambition, shuddered and cracked. Men in suits, their faces pale and slick with sweat, whispered of numbers that meant nothing and things that didn't exist.  The air itself seemed to crackle with the avarice of it all.\n\nThey called it a crisis, a financial one, but it was more than that. It was the rot at the heart of things, the festering wound of greed that had been allowed to fester for too long. The politicians, with their empty promises and their hands outstretched for more, had fanned the flames. They'd loosened the reins, let the wolves in, and now the wolves were feasting.\n\nThe banks, fattened on easy money and reckless lending, had handed out loans like candy to anyone who'd ask. They built castles on sand, mortgages to folks who couldn't afford the shoes on their feet. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those ghostly specters of government oversight, swallowed it all, repackaging the poison and selling it to anyone who'd buy.\n\nAnd the people, blinded by the glitter and the promises of easy wealth, danced on the edge of the abyss. They bought more than they could afford, houses that were cobwebs spun from air. But the air would run out, the cobwebs would unravel, and the ground would open up to swallow them whole.\n\nIt was a slow burn, a gathering storm. And then, in the dead of night, it broke. The bubble burst. The wolves howled. And the people, they screamed. The towers crumbled, the houses fell, and the wolves feasted.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where the words turn to dust and the reader's eyes glaze over. Where characters stand around swapping backstories like old rugs at a pawn shop.  Dr. Merlin, she's seen it all. She's heard the complaints, the sighs of boredom, the slams of laptop lids in frustrated retreat. \n\nExposition ain't your friend. It's the slow, creeping fog that smothers the spark of the story.  We all know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But sometimes, even veterans of the word wars stumble into the quicksand of too much telling.\n\nThink of it like this: exposition is the character standing in the middle of the dusty road, spitting out a laundry list of facts about his past instead of showing you, the reader, who he is.  He tells you he's a former soldier, a failed poet, a lover of cheap whiskey and melancholic blues. You hear the words, but you don't *feel* him. You don't see the weariness etched in his eyes, the tremor in his hand, the way his soul clings to the last embers of a long-dead dream.\n\nTake that example of the heroine, heartbroken and mourning her murdered husband.  She doesn't need to spend two pages recounting their love story. Instead, let her actions speak. Show her clutching his worn shirt, her fingers tracing the familiar scent of woodsmoke and leather. Let her gaze linger on his empty chair, her tears falling onto a half-read book.\n\nGive the reader a glimpse of their bond through stolen glances, whispered secrets, shared laughter.  Let their love story unfold in the spaces between the words, in the unspoken language of shared memories and silent grief. \n\nDon't just tell the story.  Let the story breathe, let it bleed, let it live.",
            "The flickering box in the corner spat out its news, faces washed in the pale light of the screen. A man from Ashley, Ohio, a name like a rusted hinge – Shad Hostettler – had plunged a blade into his wife.  They showed his picture, a face slack with something feral. The newsman spoke of multiples wounds, of arrest, but the details, like dust, settled quickly. Two minutes, that’s all it got. \n\nThen, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, riddled with lead in the shadows of Sharon Woods. No name, no face for the boy, just the echo of a gunshot and the swift, cold touch of a SWAT team. They said the neighborhood was “rough,” a word that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken things. \n\nA bullet hole, a ghost in the skin of a hovering metal bird, a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 whispering its death song.  A five thousand dollar reward, a desperate plea for whispers in the dark.\n\nThe weatherman, a man with slicked-back hair and a practiced smile, promised rain and heat. A tease, a distraction.\n\nThen, the robbery. A man, they said, dark-skinned, a shadow in a hoodie. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the darkness, the blackness, the weight of it all.\n\nA drug kingpin from Texas, Rene Rodriguez, a name that tasted of sin and exile. He was sentenced to “three hundred” months, a number that hung heavy in the air. Hispanic, they said, a detail that had no business there.",
            "The bond between brothers, it cuts deep. Unflinching, unyielding. A knot of things tangled tight: love, hate, envy, a touch of something mean. They see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror. A truth laid bare when the dark comes. And that truth, it comes with a price. The cost of knowing. The cost of seeing.\n\nYou can't look into a brother's eyes without seeing your own face staring back. Not the face the world sees, but the one you try to hide. The one that bleeds out in your actions, in the dust your footsteps leave behind. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk a path choked with weeds and tangled vines. The air thick with the heat of a summer that will soon turn cold. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, set by pride and shadowed by a darkness neither can name. The scorn, the fierce love, the bitter undercurrents, they all rise to the surface in the end. One brother walks away from the wreckage, the other lost to the unforgiving swamp.  \n\nThe story unfolds through the eyes of the older brother, the narrator. He is a boy consumed by pride, a heart hardened by a need to be seen, to be strong. He wants a companion who can keep pace, a mirror reflecting his own image back to him. But Doodle, his younger brother, is born frail, a fragile bird with wings too weak to fly. This pain, this frustration, it festers and grows. It poisons the air between them, thick as the humid summer air. \n\nThe narrator's actions, his every thought, are driven by this wounded pride. He wants Doodle to be what he is not. He wants him to be strong, to be like him. He tries to force it, to mold him into his own image. But Doodle, he is a wild thing, a fragile bloom struggling to survive in a world that seeks to crush him.\n\nAnd in the end, the swamp claims what it always claims. The fragile, the broken, the ones who cannot keep pace. The narrator, he is left with the echo of his brother's laughter, the taste of guilt on his tongue, and the knowledge that some bonds, no matter how strong, can be broken.",
            "The gray matter, it thinks. A tangle of wires and whispers, a storm of lightning in the skull. Used to be they said the mind was a wax tablet, smooth and blank. Then a scroll, a book. Now they say a machine. A damned contraption of levers and gears.  They miss the point.\n\nThe senses, they come first. Sight, sound, touch, all bleeding into the darkness.  The world, a symphony of whispers, a language of flesh and shadow.  The brain, it sorts it out.  Bottom-up, they call it. Bricks laid one by one, a tower rising in the mind. But there's a hand guiding the work. A watchful eye.\n\nTop-down they call it.  A knowingness, a darkness that sees before the light.  A knowing that the box is black, not because it is black, but because it must be. \n\nThe mind, it filters.  A sieve through which the world is poured.  The unimportant falls away, the vital clings.  A name in the roar of the crowd, a blade of grass in the dust, a truth whispered in the dark.\n\nBut what is truth?  A memory, a ghost of what was. A story told and retold, each telling a little different.  Remember, they say.  Forgetting is a wound that never heals.  But remembering, that's a kind of forgetting too.  The past, it slips through the fingers, like smoke.\n\nThe mind, it stores.  In the crevices of the brain, in the echoes of synapses.  A library of moments, a graveyard of dreams.  But even memories fade.  The book, it falls apart, the words blur.  Only shadows remain.\n\nHow is it organized?  A web, they say.  Connections, threads spun from thought to thought.  A map of the mind, a labyrinth of the soul.  But maps lie.  And souls, they are not maps.\n\nThe mind, it is a mystery.  A dark, unknowable place.  And the more we think we understand it, the more we realize how little we know.",
            "The man with eyes like old obsidian watched the smoke curl from the boy's cigarette. A pale ghost in the dusk. Huxley, he said, a name like dust on a windswept plain.  He spoke of a world gone soft, of flesh puppets dancing to the tune of progress. A world traded its soul for a cheap and fleeting pleasure.  \n\nHe tapped the worn paperback in his hand.  Brave New World. A world where they manufactured happiness, where the individual was a ghost in a machine.  They preached community but lived in cages of their own making.  \n\n\"He saw it coming,\" the man rasped, his voice a dry whisper. \"The trap, the gilded cage. The hunger for more, the endless consuming.  The machine grinding on.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, tracing the words on the faded cover.  \"They forgot what it meant to feel. To be truly alive.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the man sighed, his gaze fixed on the dying embers of their fire. \"They traded their souls for a bowl of synthetic gruel.  And Huxley, he knew the cost.\"\n\nThe wind picked up, a low moan through the skeletal trees.   \n\n\"He saw the world turning cold, abandoned by God. A graveyard of bones, built on the backs of the forgotten.\"  \n\nThe boy shivered, pulling his worn coat tighter. \n\n\"He saw us coming,\" the man said, his voice a harsh whisper. \"He saw the darkness gathering.\"  He looked at the boy, his eyes burning with a strange light. \"And he warned us.\"",
            "The dust of time clung to the bricks of this town, this University Park. Two years I'd walked these streets, four and a half semesters maybe, counting the slow bleed of days into each other. The campus sprawled like a wounded animal, its limbs stretching ever outward.  East Halls, they called it, where I'd first been caged like a youth.  A world away, it seemed, from the heart of things - Willard, a name that echoed with the ghosts of a thousand lectures, the Creamery, a monument to sweetness and regret, the new health services building, a testament to the fragility of our bodies. \n\nBack then, the land between East Halls and the rest was a wasteland, empty and untamed. Now it was choked with concrete and purpose-built dreams. A sprawling labyrinth of asphalt and brick. Getting from one place to another, it felt like traversing a continent. \n\nAn old dog, a man not much older than myself, told me a story. Said the East Halls had once been a distant outpost, separated by acres of silence.  Now, the silence was gone, replaced by the hum of progress, the clatter of hurried steps.\n\nI thought about it, about the time it took to get from one side of this campus to the other.  A walk to Willard from the east could be a pilgrimage, a test of endurance. Twenty-five minutes, maybe more. The wind a bitter slap against my face, the rain a cold shroud.\n\nA friend, a man who had learned the language of the road again after years of silence, spoke of the bicycle. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his voice weary with the wisdom of experience.\n\nHe was right. A bicycle, it is more than just a machine. It is a rebellion against the tyranny of distance, a whisper of freedom in a world that seeks to confine us.\n\nI bought one myself, a steel horse with gears that clicked like the bones of a long-dead beast.  It transformed my world.  The twenty-five-minute slog to Thomas became a five-minute sprint. A fleeting pleasure, a stolen moment of grace. \n\nBut the roads, they are not kind. Pollock Road, a ribbon of asphalt that cuts through the heart of the campus, a shortcut that feels like a hazard.  It demands attention, vigilance, a refusal to be consumed by the chaos.\n\nWalking, it is a different kind of journey. A time for reflection, for the slow unfolding of thoughts. But time is a thief, and I have little to spare.  \n\nThe bicycle, it is my salvation. My chariot of fire, my escape from the tedium of endless motion. It is a reminder that there is beauty in the mundane, that even in the heart of this sprawling, grasping city, there is still a place for the wind in our hair and the sun on our faces."
