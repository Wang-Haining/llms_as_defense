            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The road stretched bleak and gray, a ribbon of ash against the dying light.  Like the boy himself, it was thin and fragile, haunted by the ghosts of what had been.  He'd walk it for him, mile by mile, if it took a lifetime.  His education, a road paved with good intent, led him here, to this desolate place.  He'd heard the whispers, seen the shadows of neglect, the cracks in the foundation of families.  It was a sickness in the marrow of things, a slow rot that devoured innocence.  \n\nHe'd seen it in the eyes of that boy, the one who'd sought refuge in his friend's home, a sanctuary built on shaky ground.  The boy's silence spoke volumes, his fear a palpable thing in the stale summer air.  The parents, cloaked in their own justifications, blind to the damage they wrought. The boy needed a haven, a place where his voice could be heard, where the tremor in his hands wouldn't be dismissed as weakness. That's where he came in.  \n\nHe'd learned the language of brokenness, the code of the abandoned, the whispers of the unseen. His psychology degree, a shield against the darkness, had given him the tools, the understanding. But it was more than that. It was a fire, a burning need to mend the jagged edges of lives torn apart.\n\nHe believed in service, in the quiet dignity of respect, in the unwavering compass of ethical conduct.  These weren't just words, but the very bedrock of his being.  He'd learned from the ashes of his own past, the scars etched deep, the lessons forged in pain.\n\nSocial justice, a flickering flame in a world shrouded in darkness.  It was a fight, a battle against the tide of complacency, the apathy that masked the suffering of the voiceless.  He saw it in the faces of the forgotten, the marginalized, the ones who dared to be different.  He'd stood with them, his voice a defiant echo against the silence.  He'd fight for them, for the boy on the couch, for a world where every soul mattered. \n\nThis was his calling, his destiny.  He would walk the path, however long, however arduous, until the road to justice was paved with hope.",
            "The dark came down slow, a shroud over the land. This was a story of sleep, or the lack of it. A sickness of the mind, they called it, insomnia. Some said it was in the blood, a shadow passed down from father to son, a ghost in the genes. Others said it was the world that wore you down, the weight of it pressing on your chest, the endless grind of living. \n\nThey talked of models, of biology and society, of how the body and the world conspired to steal your rest. They spoke of neurons firing in the dark, of chemicals in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a silent conductor orchestrating the symphony of sleep.

What of the woman whose mind raced, a torrent of thoughts flooding her like a rising tide? The world wasn't just made of genes and chemicals. It was made of stories, of fear and hope, of love and loss. The world could crack a man's soul, steal his peace, and leave him hollow and empty.\n\nThey spoke of race, of poverty, of the burden of history, of how the world's injustices could wear a man down, keep him from finding solace in sleep.

            "The whispering dark of the mind, that’s what this is. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it.  A snag in the way the world speaks, the way the sounds get sorted and understood. The ears hear, sure, but the message gets lost somewhere between the soundwaves and the meanings. A wilderness in the mind, where words scatter and confusion takes root. They call it CAPD, or APD, but it’s a name for a silence, a hollowness where meaning should be. \n\nThey’ve been picking at the edges of this silence for decades, these doctors and researchers. Back in the fifties, they called it “auditory imperception,” a faint echo in the halls of understanding. They started prodding and poking, trying to find the source of the deafness in the soul. Kimura, Bocca, Calearo, names whispered in hushed tones in the halls of science, trying to map the terrain of this hidden darkness.\n\nAnd the darkness shows itself in a thousand ways.  Lost in the echo chamber of the mind, a child might not know where a sound is coming from, or which voice is speaking. Words blend together, a river of sound with no banks, no shores.

Some days, sound is a jumble, a dense fog that obscures meaning.\n\nFinding this silence, this deafness in the soul, it’s a slow, careful process.

They are all trapped, bound by a lie they cannot escape.\n\nThe play asks a question: can we ever truly know who another is, or are we always seeing a reflection in a distorted mirror? And can we ever forgive ourselves, or those we love, for the masks they wear? These are the questions that linger, long after the curtain falls.",
            "The dust hung heavy in the air, the color of bone.  German rule, they said.  Brutal. The Ovaherero, the Nama, gone.  Swallowed by the dust like ash in a dying fire. But a shadow can't be measured by the length of its darkness.  This empire, it stretched across continents, held together by iron and greed, a tapestry woven with threads of blood and sweat.  And within that tapestry, the threads of education ran different.  \n\nIn Tanganyika, the British walked in and found a people literate, a people reading. The Germans, they'd planted seeds there, watered them with knowledge. Kamerun too, whispers say, flourished under their tutelage.  But in this land, South West Africa, a different story unfolded.  A barren land, harsh and unforgiving, mirroring the spirit of the men who held dominion over it. \n\nHere, the schools were not the province of the state, no, that was left to the missionaries, these men with their Bibles and their hunger for souls.  The government, they poured resources into the education of their own, building schools, shaping minds in their own image.  But for the natives, for the black men and women, the path to literacy was a dusty, forgotten trail. \n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other German colonies boasted educated Africans, here, the vast majority remained silent, illiterate, swallowed by the silence of their own ignorance. \n\nWhat brought about this stark contrast? What drove the Germans to this systematic neglect? This paper seeks to delve into the heart of this paradox, to expose the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial masters, the fear and the prejudice that shaped this desolate landscape of learning.  \n\nThe records tell their stories, these dusty tomes written in languages both familiar and foreign. They speak of schools and systems, of progress and neglect, of the clash of cultures and the triumph of blindness.  Cohen, he wrote about this, about the stark difference between East and West Africa. He saw the settlers, the driving force behind this educational apartheid, the key to understanding this land's silent sorrow.\n\nThis land, South West Africa, a land of harsh beauty, a land where the sun beat down mercilessly, where the wind carried the whispers of forgotten languages. The white men, they came seeking gold and opportunity, a land to claim as their own.  But they overlooked the people, the living souls who inhabited this land. They saw them as obstacles, as shadows to be ignored.",
            "The dust of a hundred years has settled on the music, blurring the lines between genres. A hundred years of names piled high, each one a branch on the sprawling, thorny tree of Popular Music: Rock, Folk, Jazz, Country, Rap - a lexicon of sound, and beneath each branch, a thousand more.  Heavy Metal, born in the grimy crucible of the last forty years, is a testament to that chaos, a symphony of shadows and screams.\n\nIt’s a music of excess, a music of depth. It cuts, it bleeds, it aches with a raw intensity that bleeds from the depths of the soul. It is not a gentle music, but a music that wrestles with the darkness, that stares into the abyss and screams back.   \n\nFrom the beginning, the seeds of rebellion were sown. The first tendrils of Metal snaked out, branching into a thousand unholy offshoots. Subgenres, sub-subgenres, a hydra of sound, each one a reflection of some hidden terror, some unspoken truth. \n\nNow, the forest is choked with the tangled undergrowth of Metal’s progeny.  It has swallowed whole the traditions of other genres, twisting them into something new, something savage. Its roots run deep, drawing sustenance from the primal darkness that whispers at the edge of our dreams.\n\nBut to truly understand this beast, to grasp the essence of its fury, one must first go back to its source.  Go back to the moment when darkness gave birth to sound, when chaos became a symphony.\n\nFor Metal is not merely a genre, it is a movement. A movement fueled by a hunger for something more, something real, something primal. A movement born of drugs, of despair, of the desperate need to express the darkness that festers within us all. \n\nIt is a music that sings of anger, of pain, of the fragility of existence. It is a music that does not shy away from the shadows, but embraces them. \n\nAnd in those shadows, in the heart of the storm, we find the true soul of Metal.",
            "The man in the smoky room, the one they called Rousseau, he'd been painting his dreams for years. Not the kind that come in the dead of night, but the ones that woke him with the rasp of want. Dreams of color, of light, of a canvas that breathed back at him. A dream of seeing his name etched in the annals of art, not the back of some dusty ledger. But the world, it spat on dreams like a dog on a bone.  \n\nHe'd been a customs man, a gabelou they called him, a tollkeeper on the edge of things.  The work kept him fed, but it choked his soul. He yearned to paint, to build worlds with brushstrokes and pigment, to show them what lay hidden beneath the surface of things. He started late, a man pushing forty with calloused hands and a heart full of longing.\n\nHe'd seen the work of those fine artists, the ones who flitted about Paris like moths to a flame. They painted with ease, with a confidence he could only dream of. He yearned to be like them, to be recognized, to be heard. But his work, it was different. Raw. Unpolished. A whisper in a shout.\n\nHe painted his dreams, the ones that haunted him, the ones that both terrified and comforted him. He painted jungles teeming with life, women draped in moonlight, landscapes that stretched out into eternity. He painted what he saw, what he felt, what he yearned for.\n\nBut the art world, it was a cold mistress. She demanded conformity, obedience. She wanted artists who followed the rules, who painted what she told them to paint. And Rousseau, he refused. He painted his truth, his own vision of the world. \n\nHis \"Dream,\" that's what they called it. A woman lost in a world of fantasy, a world of his own making. A world where the impossible was real, where the mundane was magical. He poured his heart and soul into that painting, his longing, his frustration, his defiance. \n\nHe knew they wouldn't understand. He knew they'd scorn him, dismiss him as a naive fool. But he didn't care. He painted for himself, for the sake of the dream. Because in the end, it was his dream, and his alone.",
            "The air  hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A truth hung there too, unspoken, a thing that sat heavy in the chest like a stone. The old men, the thinkers, they'd said it for years – that beauty and truth were two sides of the same coin, bound together by some unseen thread.  Like Keats in his poems, they'd whispered of beauty as truth, and truth as beauty.  But what did it mean? What did it mean to know a truth so deep it felt like a wound, a truth so raw it bled into the very fabric of your being?\n\nWe learn things, sure. We cram facts and figures into our heads, soak up knowledge like a sponge. But these truths, these ethical knots, these aesthetic pangs, they weren't learned things. They burrowed into you, took root, bloomed in the dark places of the soul. We try to explain them, dissect them, analyze them like specimens under a glass.  We talk about brushstrokes and bone structures, moral codes and personal narratives.  But it's not enough. Something always remains, a shadow across the light, an echo in the silence.  \n\nTake a picture, for instance.  You can break down the composition, the light, the shadows. You can say it's a masterpiece or a sham, a snapshot of a moment in time. But that doesn't tell you why it grabs you by the throat and squeezes, why it leaves you breathless and hollow-eyed. It's that something else, the ineffable, the unspoken. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, sometimes the truth is just too big to say. It has to be told, woven into a story, a tapestry of words that bleeds with feeling.  And like Wittgenstein, I believe there are truths that can't be spoken, only felt.  They're out there, in the liminal spaces, the spaces between the lines, the spaces where the soul breathes. \n\nMaybe that's why art and ethics are so intertwined. Because they both speak to that ultimate truth, the one that lies just beyond our grasp.  They show us the world, not as it is, but as it could be, as it might have been, as it yearns to be. They teach us to see the beauty in the broken, the meaning in the meaningless, the hope in the ashes.",
            "The wind scrapes across the plains of Germany.  A cold wind. A wind that whispers stories of iron and fire, of tribes that fought beneath a sky the color of pewter.  From the shadowed Alps where Munich stands, its breath held tight against the chill, to the salt-laced air of Kiel on the Baltic, it carries the same scent:  a blend of earth and ash, of ancient wood smoke.  The Rhine winds through Köln, a serpent of silver, and the Saxon city of Dresden, born on the Elbe, echoes its song. This is a land conjoined from fragments, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, woven together by the threads of time.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost on the wind, clings to the land like the scent of pine needles.  Its meaning, lost in the mists of ages, is a bone gnawed clean by time. Tacitus, that chronicler of shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that had crossed the Rhine, leaving behind a trail of fire and steel. Their battles with the Gauls, he wrote, were like storms, their fury a tide that swept across the land. Caesar, the Roman eagle, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicle of conquest. He used it to mark the boundary between the conquered and the unconquered, a line drawn in blood and iron. Some whisper that the word came from the Gauls themselves, a word that carried the sting of fear, a sound that meant \"those who dwell beyond the river.\" Others say it came from the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon that danced in the hands of warriors, a whisper of death on the wind.  \n\nTacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched by the tide of civilization.  He saw them as primordial, untouched by the migrations and wars that shaped the world. Their lands, he wrote, were wild, their skies a canvas of storms, their faces etched with the harsh beauty of the north.  Who would leave the warmth of Rome, the comfort of vast cities, for the harsh embrace of Germania? Only those who were born of its soil, who knew its secrets, who spoke its language.\n\nRome, for all its might, never fully conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking riches and glory, but they never truly possessed its heart. They traded with the tribes, they fought with them, and they took what they could, but in the end, they retreated, leaving behind a land that remained stubbornly free.  \n\nAnd so, Germania lived on. A land of forests and mountains, of rivers and plains, a land of indomitable spirit. A land whose story is still being written.",
            "The water stared back, a mirror of the abyss in my gut. Brown. Just brown.  No swirls, no play of light.  It was a truth laid bare, a solid, unyielding thing.  Thoughts, like flies, buzzed around the edges, skittering and fleeting.  None of them settled.  This wasn't art. It wasn't even the beginning of a story. More like the end.  The final, ugly scene.\n\nI'd read somewhere, maybe in one of those art books, about how to see. To strip things down. To find the essential line, the core of the thing.  Like a frame around a bowl of fruit, they said.  But there was no frame for this. Just the brown, and the stink. \n\nPicasso, Monet, they all had their colors. Their worlds.  My world was brown.  This brown.  The brown of regret, the brown of failure.\n\nMy hand gripped the handle, knuckles white.  Muscle memory took over, a practiced movement. But this time, it felt wrong.  The water stirred, a ripple of disgust. A piece broke free, a dark, shapeless thing.  It drifted, then sank.  I tried again. The flush, a weak sigh.  Still there.\n\nThe mop lay limp in my hand, a useless white flag.  A green tie choked me, a symbol of some forgotten occasion.  I stared at the brown, my mind a blank slate.  No thoughts, no inspiration, just the weight of it.\n\nThe toilet paper, a thin sheet of hope, felt flimsy against the cold porcelain.  I wrapped it, layer by layer, a shroud.  My hand, buried deep, felt the slickness, the cold.  A mother's touch, they said, but this wasn't love.  It was resignation.\n\nThe brown held fast.",
            "The road is a graveyard for boys.  A blacktop river choked with the bones of youth. Too many of them, slick and young, behind the wheel, their eyes bright with the recklessness of a dawn that never comes. It's in their blood, this need for speed, this hunger for the open road. The doctors say their minds ain't built for it, that the circuits ain't fused, the wires ain't set. But they crave it all the same, the rush, the feeling of being untouchable. And they die for it, these boys, in a thousand twisted heaps of metal and glass.\n\nCalifornia, they say, tried to hold them back, to clip their wings with their licenses, to make them wait, to teach them patience. But patience ain't a virtue these young ones understand. They're driven by something else, something primal, something that whispers in their ears, urging them forward, whispering of freedom and of escape.\n\nZuckerman, the psychologist, he knows. He sees it in their eyes,  the glint of the abyss, the yearning for the fall. They want to feel alive, to test the boundaries, to see how close they can get to the edge before they lose their grip.\n\nAnd the edge is always there, waiting. A curve in the road, a patch of black ice, a reckless passenger, a sudden phone call. All it takes is a moment, a split second, and the world can be turned upside down.\n\nThey say millions more are coming, these children of the boomers, ready to take their place behind the wheel. They'll learn the same lessons, the hard way, the way all their predecessors have.\n\nMaybe there's a way to stop it, to turn the tide. Maybe there's a way to teach them to wait, to find their freedom in other ways, to understand the weight of the responsibility they carry. \n\nBut for now, the road remains a graveyard.  And the boys keep coming, drawn to its seductive danger, their hearts beating a reckless rhythm against the cold steel of their fate.",
            "In the dim glow of the Library of Congress archives, I sifted through Edison's dusty films, a collection of trickery from the nascent days of cinema. Fifteen flickers of artifice, cobbled together between '95 and '01. Illusions spun from the alchemy of editing, each frame a whisper of magic. My gaze fell upon these early attempts, seeking the poetics woven into their silent narratives. Some adhered to the stark simplicity of the time, others dared to breach the boundaries.\n\nThese phantoms of the silver screen, they were tethered to their stage. A proscenium arch framing each tableau, the camera a watchful eye, unmoving, fixed in its gaze. A stage borrowed from the theatre, a legacy of vaudeville, a whisper of the magic lantern. Figures danced within this confined space, confined to movements side to side, their paths never leading toward or away from the lens.  \n\nConsider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a 1900 apparition. Actors enter from the right, their journey confined to the horizontal plane, vanishing off-screen, leaving the camera behind, uncaring.\n\nLong shots, and occasionally a glimpse of the medium, were the only windows into this world. Close-ups? A foreign concept, unheard of in these spectral halls. A relic of the stage, where the entire tableau unfolded before the audience, framed by the proscenium's embrace.\n\nEach trick, a self-contained unit. One thought, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting breath in time. A vaudeville skit, a magic trick, a vanishing act, all compressed into a silent symphony. A single concept, a single shot, a single breath. But trickery, as it is wont to do, hides its seams. One conceptual shot, a phantom in the viewer's eye, may be a tapestry woven from multiple threads, each frame a stitch in the illusion.\n\nObserve \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a film from 1895. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, the moment where the severed head appears, a phantom born of artifice.",
            "The wind scoured the plains of Carolina, a constant, bleak presence. John Taylor, a man forged in the crucible of soil and sun, knew its bite as well as he knew the feel of weathered wood beneath his calloused hands.  He was a man of words, a man of purpose, his life a testament to the grit of the land he tilled. But his mind was a fortress, its walls built of conviction and the unwavering belief in a government that served the land, not the other way around.  He saw himself as a shepherd, guiding the flock of men toward a pasture of liberty, a land where the tiller of the soil held dominion.\n\nThis land, this republic, was a blank canvas, a chance to paint a masterpiece of freedom. He'd seen the rot of old ways, the shackles of tradition holding men down like bound cattle. He believed in the inherent goodness of man, a spark that needed only the right conditions to ignite.  But that spark, he knew, could also be twisted, consumed by greed and ambition. \n\nThat's why he fought for a government as lean and unforgiving as the winter winds, a government that kept its distance, allowing men to shape their own destinies.  He saw the danger in a leviathan, its tentacles reaching into every corner of life, smothering the very soul of independence.  He believed in a Constitution that was a sacred covenant, its words etched not in stone, but in the blood and sweat of men who yearned for freedom.  The Declaration, a beacon in the night, its light guiding them toward a future where the individual mattered, where the land was not a prize to be plundered but a birthright to be cherished.\n\n\n\nHe saw the world in shades of black and white, good and evil, a constant struggle between the two.  He saw the inherent flaws in man, the lust for power that gnawed at the heart of every leader, but he also saw the potential for greatness, the yearning for a world where every man could stand tall, unburdened by the yoke of tyranny.  He knew that the path was fraught with peril, that the wolves of despotism prowled the shadows, waiting to devour the innocent. But he clung to the belief that man, in his own time, could rise above his baser instincts and build a world worthy of the sacrifices made by those who came before.",
            "A cold wind blew through the pines. The figures in the logs, they dropped like stones in the third month. A sudden, hard fall. Disheartening. Winter had come to the campus, a gray pall with the onset of frost. Fewer bicycles, fewer walkers on the road. December, the semester's end. The air thick with the scent of burnt sugar and the hollowness of empty halls. A time for books, for packing, for goodbyes.  Maybe the log slips had fallen from minds preoccupied with the year's leaving. And then, the holidays, a long exhale, a silence. The campus, nearly a ghost town, students scattered to their homes, the faculty gone. January, the new year, a thin sliver of light cutting through the darkness. Then February, a hollow month, a gray echo. \n\nThe project, a bright spark at first, a flare in the darkness. But the flame flickers, its light dimming. To fight this, they conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of fire in March. The logs, they rose again, a brief resurgence. \n\nThe truth is, this battle was fought on two fronts. One, the natural ebb and flow of fervor. The other, the hold of the car, a deep-rooted comfort in a land where freedom is measured in miles driven. A siren song.  \n\nTo entice, they offered gifts: tokens of appreciation, whispers of reward.  Gift certificates to local haunts, places of comfort and respite. But what if they'd offered more? A bicycle, a hybrid's sleek promise, the silent hum of an electric dream? Would that have held the line, kept the logs full? Perhaps.\n\nThe prizes, they remained constant throughout the project. A steady hand, a steady reward. But what if they had evolved, grown in value with the passing months? A promise of greater things, a crescendo of incentive.  Imagine, a whisper of a bicycle in December, then the full promise of a hybrid in January. A silent, seductive lure.",
            "The dust of the market swirls. A thing called an ETF, they call it. A traded fund. Like a stock, they say, but it holds a basket of things. An index, a commodity, maybe even a handful of other stocks.  They say it gives you the spread of an index fund, the  lean of a single stock. You can short it, they say, lever it, buy in small bites. But it ain't free. A commission, they call it, for every trade.  Like a toll on the road to wealth.\n\nAnd the ratios, the expense ratios, they whisper. Lower than a mutual fund, they say. But is that enough? Is the promise of diversification, this phantom word, truly there? Or is it a mirage in the desert of the market?\n\nThis, then, is our examination. We'll look at IHF, this ETF, and its top ten holdings. 63% of its body, they say. Will these scraps of the whole tell the story of the whole?

Or if it can dance a better dance.\n\nThe numbers whisper:\n\n* [Insert chart with Beta and return calculations here] *\n\nThe numbers sing a song of higher return, a lower swing. Maybe, just maybe, these ten can outpace the whole. But the whispers speak of another question: are these differences real? Or just the echoes of chance?\n\nWe'll need to look deeper, into the heart of these stocks, at their individual swings. We'll measure their standard deviations, their own dances with risk.  Will the sum of their swings be different from the swing of the whole?\n\nThe market holds its breath. The dust settles. We wait for the answer.",

In it, he whispers of Thulé, a name echoing from Virgil, a lost isle north of Britain's shore, the edge of the known world. Virgil, yes, but there's another wind whispering these words, a German wind. Poe, he drank deep from the well of German thought. \n\nKarl J. Arndt, he saw it clear, the kinship between Poe and Goethe's Mignon. He saw it in the lines, a mirrored grief.  Poe, he borrowed the echoes, some say, crafting his own melancholy in the shadow of the master. \n\nOxford whispers of Goethe's Faust, a towering figure in the landscape of German verse. Two parts, like a heartbeat, the first in 1808, the second in the year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Within that shadowed second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" unfolds. A king, broken by loss, his queen gone, a goblet left as a phantom reminder. He drinks, he weeps, he sees only the ghost of her face in the fading light. The cliff calls, the goblet falls, and he, like a shattered mirror, breaks himself upon the edge of oblivion. \n\nPoe, he knew this king, this mirror image of grief. Could he not see himself reflected there? In the echoing halls of \"Dream-Land,\" the king's despair finds a kindred spirit. In the desolate landscape of Poe's poem, the speaker wanders, haunted by the shades of lost friends, trapped in a world drained of color and life. \n\nThulé, a bookend to Poe's dreams, a final echo of loss. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they breathe the same air of sorrow. \n\nAnd Goethe?

A half hour. That’s all it took. Half an hour for a man to know, to be told, to turn from his dinner and do what was right. But Paul Martin, the manager, had chosen hunger over heed. Twice he was warned. Twice he dismissed the danger. Twice he let the slickness linger, a silent invitation to disaster. He knew. He knew the aisles of D&D Markets were slick with peril. He'd seen the others fall before, the five who'd stumbled and broken in the same year, victims of his negligence. But still, the applesauce remained, a testament to his callousness. He was a shepherd who ignored his flock, a captain who steered his ship into the storm. And now, Jennifer Palmer, a woman with dreams and a future, lay broken on the cold floor, her back a canvas for pain.\n\nA judge, they say, will not be kind to Martin. The law whispers of malice, of a disregard so profound, so willful, that it transcends mere negligence. It speaks of actions fueled not by mistake, but by a cold indifference to the suffering that might result. The question becomes, was Martin's choice to eat, to ignore, a choice born of malice? Did he know, deep in his heart, that he was playing with fire?  Did he know, and did he care? \n\nThe state of California offers a glimpse into the mind of a judge. They speak of \"despicable\" acts, of a disregard for the \"rights and safety\" of others. Can Martin's actions, his callous indifference, be labeled as such? \n\nThe evidence whispers: a manager warned twice, a spill left unattended, a woman shattered.

Islam, they called it. The word itself, sharp and foreign on the tongue. Back then, the air crackled with the heat of debate. Hostile? Was it a religion born of rage, a sword brandished against the world? Or was it something else entirely?  \n\nThe world had shifted since then, tilted on its axis like a drunken dancer. The towers had fallen, the dust had choked the sky, and the faces on the news had hardened, their eyes reflecting the fear. Islam, once demonized, now bathed in an unsettling light of tolerance. A president with a name like Borac Obama, a name whispered with suspicion, yet somehow embraced. The world, like a river, finds its own course, carving new paths through the bedrock of belief.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tangled thread woven through time, drew him in. He had known the tales, the conquest, the subjugation, the fire of faith forced down the throats of the unwilling. But this biography, it painted a different picture. A humble man, misunderstood, a voice crying in the wilderness. People drawn to him like moths to a flickering flame, not by the sword, but by the light in his eyes.\n\nYet, the echo of another story lingered, a ghost in the air. The miracles, the multiplying loaves and fishes, a mirror reflecting the deeds of a different prophet, a different savior. A flicker of unease, a suspicion that history was being rewritten,  a sacred narrative reshaped to fit a new mold.\n\nThe voices of the witnesses, distant echoes through the years, whispered their tales. But the distance, the layers of retelling, cast a shadow of doubt. Was it truth, or was it a carefully constructed edifice, built upon the shifting sands of hearsay?\n\nThe portrait that emerged, a man of gentleness and wisdom, seemed at odds with the historical record. The shadows of his past, the whispers of conquest and bloodshed, refused to be silenced.  Could they reconcile the man of peace with the warrior king? Could faith truly flourish in the crucible of violence?",

They became tangled in weeds, choked by the dust of forgetting.\n\nNow the world spins on, a wheel beneath a cold, indifferent sky. Progress, they call it.  Men march forward, their eyes fixed on the horizon, blind to the bones beneath their feet. They think themselves enlightened, but the darkness closes in.

It will rise up like a ghost, a chill in the marrow, a whisper in the night. They will seek him, the man, the source, the wellspring. They will strip away the layers, the accretions, the bones of dogma and reach for the flesh, the blood, the word.\n\nAnd when they find it, when they taste the salt of truth on their tongues, the world will change. Not in a blaze of fire, not with trumpets and armies. But in a slow, creeping thaw, a softening of the heart, a loosening of the hold.  They will remember.  They will be whole.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, it will stand.  A pillar in the storm, a beacon in the night.  But its face will be changed.  For the clock, it will turn backward.

They saw no humanity in the cracked hands, the hollow eyes, the coughs that choked the life from their lungs. \n\nThey built their empires on the backs of the broken, the forgotten, the desperate.  They knew their workers were slaves, not in chains, but in chains of poverty and fear.  There was no escape, no safety net, no chance for redemption.  The system was rigged, designed to keep them down, to keep them docile, to keep them silent.\n\nSinclair saw it all, this festering wound upon the soul of the nation. He wrote it down, a testament to the cruelty, the indifference, the utter depravity of it all. He cried out against the injustice, against the darkness that threatened to consume them all.",
            "The world is painted in shades, a palette of meaning the man with the pen lays down. Fitzgerald, he calls himself.  Fitzgerald knows how to bleed a color, to make it sing. It ain't just the sight of it, it's what it whispers. Like gold, it can shimmer with promise, or turn to dust in your hand. Green, it can be the yearning in a man's heart, or the rot of decay. White and gray, they dance together, a mournful waltz. White, the color of a lie whispered sweet, the promise of a dream. Gray, the dust settling on that dream, the weight of time. And red, pink, they bleed into each other, a fever dream, the flush of passion, and the stain of blood.\n\nFitzgerald, he builds these meanings slow, brick by brick, word by word.  He paints a picture with them, and you see it clear as day. Daisy, she's wrapped in white, always in white. A porcelain doll, beautiful, but cold.  Her world, it's all white, the parties, the clothes, the faces.  It's the world of the rich, the privileged, the ones who don't know the taste of ash.  And then there's the gray. The gray of the valley, the gray of the forgotten, the gray of a life lived in the shadow of something brighter. It's the color of Gatsby's dreams, fading, turning to ash.\n\nHe paints them together, these colors, and you see the truth. The emptiness of the white, the hollowness of the gray. He makes you feel it, the ache in your chest, the longing for something more. Fitzgerald, he's a master.\n\nHe paints a picture, not with a brush, but with words. And you see the world through his eyes.",
            "The land breathed out dust, dry and cracked under the sun. San Diego County, they called it. A place of plenty, choked with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens spilling over the hills like spilled secrets. But the air held a weight, a yolk of something stale and forgotten. The sun, it never really quit beating down, a hammer on the land, forging a life of sweat and toil.\n\nThey spoke of organic farms, these pockets of green in the dusty expanse. They were like whispers in the wind, promises of a better way. A way to coax life from the earth without poisoning it, a way to fill the bellies of men and the souls of birds. \n\nThey said there were waiting lists for this bounty, a hunger for the clean taste of a world untouched by man’s greed.  Eggs and milk, the color of dawn, pure and untouched.  They offered tours, glimpses into a world where the earth was not a conquered beast but a partner, a companion.\n\nBut the whispers, they weren't always kind.  They spoke of harder labor, of battles fought against weeds and pests with only sweat and song. Of losses, the sting of failure in a land that demanded its due. The scales tipped, they said, favoring the large, the loud, the ones who drowned the earth in chemicals and reaped the harvest in bitter silence.\n\nStill, they clung to the hope. A hope that the land itself could be healed, that the symphony of life could be restored. They sought refuge in the shadows of government programs, a lifeline tossed out to those who dared to dream of a different future. They spoke of biodiversity, of a patchwork quilt of life woven into the fabric of the earth.  Trees reaching for the sky, birdsong filling the air, a world where man and nature danced in a fragile, beautiful balance.\n\nThe land, it held its secrets close. A parcel of 160 acres, a tapestry of chaparral and oak woodland, whispering tales of indigenous spirits and weathered cattle trails. The ghosts of homesteaders, their names etched in the bones of the earth, lingered still.\n\nThey chose this land, a sliver of hope in a world teetering on the brink. A place to build a future, a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. A place to heal the earth, one seed at a time.",
            "The wind scours the bones of a place. Culture, it ain't a thing you can hold in your hand, not like a fist. It's the dust that settles in the hollows, the taste of ash on the tongue, the way a man looks at the ground when he speaks. \n\nYou can't say all Frenchmen are lovers or all Englishmen are stoic, that's just the wind howling through empty barns. Culture's a ghost story told a thousand times, each telling a little different, a little darker. \n\nWhen you sit across from a stranger, his face a map of truths and lies, you see your own face staring back. Maybe that's why the world's so hard, why the heart cracks open at the sight of a familiar scar.\n\nBut you can't judge a man by the dust on his coat or the way he holds his pipe. You gotta listen to the silence between the words, the way his eyes track the shadows. See the ghosts in the corners of his mind.\n\nThere's a hunger in the air, a gnawing need to understand. But the truth is, you can't fully grasp another man's soul, no matter how hard you try. You're just two travelers on a road that leads nowhere, each carrying the weight of your own stories. \n\nAnd in the end, the only currency that matters is trust. A fragile thing, like a flame in the wind.\n\nThat's the thing about culture, about people. It's a dance in the dark. You take a step, they take a step, and sometimes you stumble, sometimes you fall. But you keep dancing, because there's nowhere else to go.",
            "The fool’s tongue, it whispers, “There is no God.”  The words crawl from Psalm 14, the same words that coil around Anselm’s argument, a serpent seeking purchase in the heart of belief. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same phantom, the God of the Bible, the God of fire and brimstone, the God of whispered promises. To compare them, we must accept this God, this entity, as the bedrock upon which they build their case.  To stray from this path would be to wander into a wilderness of gods, a chaos of shadows.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the confines of the mind.  He says that God exists because we know him, because to conceive of his absence is to stumble against the very fabric of understanding.  It's a truth born of contemplation, a light flickering within the skull. But is this truth enough? Can the mind, this fragile cage of bone and sinew, truly hold the weight of divinity?\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path. His God is a God of reason, a God who can be apprehended through the logic of the world, through the patterns of creation.  He lays out five arguments, five pillars of proof. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony.  Each one a brick laid in a wall, a wall designed to contain the divine within the bounds of human comprehension.\n\nBut are these arguments truly convincing? Does logic alone suffice to build a bridge to the infinite? Or do they, like Anselm’s faith, remain tethered to the limitations of the human mind?\n\nBoth men, they seek to prove the existence of God, but their methods diverge. One looks inward, the other outward.  And yet, neither truly offers a holistic understanding, a complete map of the divine.  Perhaps the truth, it lies somewhere beyond their reach, veiled in mystery, waiting to be discovered by a mind yet to be born.",
            "Dust settled on the road. A prince was born, they say, in some time long gone. Some fifth or sixth century before the reckoning. They called him Buddha. He walked away from the world, they say, found some kind of peace in the shadows and the quiet. His words took root and spread, bloomed into a religion. Buddhism they called it. The Theravada kind being the purest, they say.  Old as time, twenty-five hundred years or more. But the world shifts. The things that held meaning then, they don't hold the same weight now. Look at Sri Lanka, where they cut the water still. Monks and men, all joining hands in a ritual. Some kind of ceremony. But Buddha, they say, never spoke of such things. The changes in the faith, they run deep. From the surface whispers to the heart of the matter.\n\nThe monks, the layfolk, they've had to adjust. Turn the scriptures, reshape the meaning. Forces from the inside and the outside, both good and bad, they've been at play.\n\nThere are words we'll be using a lot, see. Inside and outside. Inside means the ones who follow the Buddhasasana, monks and layfolk alike. Outside means anything that comes from those who don't.  And then there's the good and the bad. The bad ones, they want to hurt the faith, see. Their words are like thorns, aimed at the heart of the Buddha's teachings. The good ones, they don't mean to help or harm. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's just the way things are.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the heart of it all. The core beliefs of Theravada Buddhism. They find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, that's the teachings, the Tripitaka, the three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka, that's the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, especially for the monks. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that's the deeper stuff, the metaphysics.  No soul, they say. Suffering is all there is. Everything changes. Only by seeing this can you escape the cycle of birth and death, the Sansara.  And along with it, desire, hatred, delusion, they all fade away. Enlightenment comes.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, it lays down the rules. Five precepts for the layfolk: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't lust, don't get drunk. The monks, they have many more rules to follow. The most important thing, though, is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, suffering comes from clinging. Third, suffering can be overcome. Fourth, the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The sun bled through the haze, a pale ghost of its former self, casting long shadows on the dusty plains. It hung low in the sky, the same sky that had witnessed the slow burn of a rivalry, a feud as old as the land itself.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of animosity that stretched back over half a century, from the year 1836 to the cusp of a new century in 1893.  A war, the Mexican-American War, scarred the land, a wound that festered for years. Texas, the Southwest, these territories bled away from Mexico, claimed by the United States in a bloody conflict.\n\nThe clash wasn't just over land, though. It was a clash of worlds, of cultures and beliefs, a storm of different gods and devils raging in the hearts of men. Religion, tradition, a hunger for something more, these things drove the nations apart, fueled the fires of resentment. They circled each other, wary beasts, always ready to strike.\n\nThis wasn't unique, this rivalry.  Borders, those lines drawn in the sand, often breed conflict. Nations, like wolves in the night, eyeing each other's territory, their needs and desires a tangled web of greed and fear.  The United States, a wolf with a hunger for expansion, found itself fixated on these southern neighbors, Mexico and Cuba, a constant thorn in its side.\n\nReligion, that ever-present force, cast a long shadow.  The Americans, wary of Catholicism, of monarchy, saw in Mexico a reflection of their own past, a history they sought to shed.  This wasn't unlike the Cold War, a battle not just of ideologies, but of souls.  The United States, like a child guarding its toys, feared the influence of Mexico, its ancient beliefs a threat to its own.\n\nThe land itself bore the scars of this conflict.  Border disputes, raids, whispers of violence - these were the echoes of a past that refused to die.  Outlaws, bandits, ghosts of history roamed the dusty plains, their footsteps a reminder of the fragility of peace.\n\nFor a time, the United States, the bigger, stronger wolf, triumphed.  Mexico, forced to bow to its will, became dependent, a shadow of its former self.  But the hunger of power never truly sates.  The United States, its gaze shifting, now sought not land, but control, manipulating the economy, the strings of power.\n\nThe rivalry, a slow burn over decades, finally flickered and died.  But the ghosts of the past lingered, a reminder that peace is a delicate dance, a fragile thing, easily shattered by the winds of change.",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came upon me sudden, unexpected. A thing I’d never known. Nurse I was then, tending to others. Chosen it for the kind of peace it promised. A life of steady work, a life where sickness would always be, always need tending. A mantra, whispered from childhood: *You'll always find work, people will always get sick.*  My own dreams, they'd lain fallow – science, perhaps, or words put to paper, a blend of both.  But nursing, that was the safe choice. \n\nYet here I was. Forty-six years walked, single, pockets as bare as a winter wind. The sickness, it took hold, a thief in the night. Fifteen years on,  the world spins on, but I’m caught in the undertow. Social Security, a thin thread, that’s all that keeps me afloat. Nothing left to call my own, not a single thing. Every day a struggle, a gnawing at the edges of security, safety, and the thin veil of self-respect. The world’s a shaky thing, uncertain. But one truth shines clear: Without the hand of family, the kindness of friends, I’d be swallowed whole. In the face of real disaster, you discover just how fragile the human spirit can be.\n\nLife, it throws curveballs. Big ones, small ones, they keep coming. No matter how hard you plan, some things are too vast to face alone.\n\nWe talk, these days, about pulling back from the big government, righting the ship before it sinks. And maybe that’s right. But I’d rather see folks learn to trust again, to offer a hand, to ask for help when the world turns cold. We’re not meant to be islands, adrift in a sea of fear.\n\nThe talk is of rugged individualism, the backbone of this nation.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn’t do it by grit alone. They did it with compassion, with respect, with the shared burden of survival. \n\nSo, yes, be ready. I am. I have my supplies – bandages, water tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods. If you have the land, the means, grow your own food, can it, preserve it. A wood stove, a good idea if you’re not stuck in an apartment.\n\nBut while you’re at it, get to know your neighbors.  Build a bridge, not a wall.",
            "The shape a thing takes, why it takes that shape, a question as old as the rocks themselves.  Even now, we barely grasp how to speak of it, how to measure in numbers the slow, creeping dance of change over time. Thompson, he saw it, back in '17, the need for a language beyond words, a way to map the very marrow of creation.  \n\nWe're trying to find that language, to understand how a shell, a spiraled curve of bone, comes to be.  These Prumnu shells, they tell a story, a story in whorl and suture, in the slow widening of the spiral.  We use the eye, but also the eye of the machine,  CerioShell, a program that can spin the numbers, conjure forms, show us the echoes of what might have been, what could yet be.\n\nA shell, it's a journey through time. A tube that winds, a spiral that stretches across space, through 360 degrees. Each turn, a whorl, and the path it takes, the speed it gathers, that's the story written in bone.\n\nImagine the aperture, the mouth of the shell, a point that moves, a traveler tracing its path through time. We can map its journey, its coordinates, the radius of its path. And from those coordinates, we can see the direction of the journey, the constraints that shape it.\n\nThere's a language in the whorls, in the sutures, a language we're just beginning to learn.  It's a language of limits, of possibilities, of the slow, relentless march of change.",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. In Indonesia, the children died.  Not in the quick, sudden violence of storm or flood, but in the slow, suffocating grip of neglect.  For a decade, the numbers had held, a grim plateau against the rising tide of progress that swept through the other facets of life.  Millennium promises, those grand pronouncements of a better world, they were met with a hollow echo.  Water flowed, sanitation improved, yet the children still withered,  their small lives extinguished before they could truly begin.\n\nThey told you of skilled attendants at birth, 72% they claimed, a figure that danced on the edge of meaning.  Midwives, women steeped in the ancient lore of the womb, they counted too.  But what use was lore against the hemorrhage that stole mothers, the fever that choked the newborn?\n\nAnd the diarrhea, a relentless scourge that ravaged the littlest ones.  Fewer sought treatment now, the numbers whispered, a silent retreat from the shadow of illness.\n\nEven the caesarean section, a blade held against the flesh, remained a distant hope.  Only 4% of births received this intervention, a stark reminder of the chasm that yawned between the urban sprawl and the forgotten villages.\n\nThe rich, they had their access, their hospitals glittering under the sun.  But for the poor, the journey was a gamble, the cost a silent killer.  A 27% gap, a canyon of despair separating the haves from the have-nots.\n\nSo what was to be done?  Programmatic solutions, they called them, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But each bandaged wound, a testament to the failure of the whole.  To pour resources into one narrow channel, was to starve the rest.  A grand house built on a single pillar, destined to crumble. \n\nThe answer, it seemed, lay not in quick fixes but in the slow, painstaking work of building a true system, a web of care that reached every corner, every soul.  A system where the whisper of the child's cry was heard, not in the sterile halls of the rich, but in the heart of the village, in the warmth of the mother's embrace.",
            "The dust of vanished worlds clung to the cobblestones, whispering tales of a time when gaslights flickered and carriages clattered, a time before the endless ash choked the air and the sun bled gray. Victorian novels, those monuments to detail and the gilded cages of the aristocracy, held little sway in this bleached landscape. Yet, even in this desolation, echoes of that era linger, twisting in the shadows like phantoms. Two tales, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" rise from the ruins, their mysteries deepened by a touch of the grotesque, a shimmer of the uncanny. They dare to delve into the hearts of their characters, not through the polite pronouncements of drawing-room dialogues, but through a darkness that reflects the soul's own hidden abyss.\n\nThe streets of London, slick with rain and reeking of decay, bleed into Oliver's dreams. His mind, a fractured mirror reflecting the fractured world around him, becomes a stage for fragmented memories and haunting presences.  \n\n> *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese fragmented visions are not mere phantoms of the night; they are the ragged edges of Oliver's shattered reality. Sikes and Crackit, the embodiment of brutality and greed, stalk him even in his dreams, their voices echoing the threat that hangs over him. The gunshot, a jarring punctuation mark in his fractured world, rings out not as a singular event but as a constant torment, a reminder of his vulnerability and the indifference of the world he inhabits. His escape feels less like liberation and more like a descent into a deeper, more insidious darkness. \n\nOn the windswept moors of \"Wuthering Heights,\" shadows dance with a different kind of menace. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, leaving the characters trapped in a cycle of obsession and revenge. The novel's gothic atmosphere, its desolate landscapes and brooding characters,  becomes a crucible where the human heart is twisted and consumed.\n\n\nThe mysteries that shroud both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" are not mere literary devices. They are windows into the darker recesses of the human soul, reflecting the anxieties and terrors that lurk beneath the surface of Victorian society. In a world where appearances can be deceiving and the veneer of civilization is thin, these novels force us to confront the raw, unvarnished truth: that beneath the surface of order and decorum, chaos and madness reign.",
            "The boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, he was a puzzle.  Didn't read right. Some letters, no problem, others…like they were written in a tongue he’d never heard.  Latino, that was for sure, but his English was clean, no accent, no stammer.  He struggled, a plaintive thing, and I wrestled with him over sentences, over sounds, over words that wouldn’t come. It was a back road to nowhere.  \n\nThen his mother came. A quiet woman, Spanish her only song. I knew just a few words, enough to hold a line, a thread.  But when she spoke, her hands tracing her son’s face, understanding bloomed, slow and heavy.  Adrian, he could read, just not the letters. Not the alphabet.  It was a key missing, a lock without teeth.  \n\nThat day, the weight lifted a mite. Not a cure, just a glimpse of the truth.  I don't know if it helped him much.  Hope he’s alright.\n\nThat boy, he's a ghost now, a whisper in the dust.  But he brought a truth to the surface, one that  grabs you by the collar out here in California.  The language barrier, it's a wall, invisible, yet solid.  You think you see a child, you see the struggle, but sometimes the truth hides behind a veil.\n\nIt ain't always obvious.  A kid speaks perfect English, but the letters, they're strangers.  A reading problem, but one born of a different tongue. \n\nAdrian, he was a start, a crack in the wall.   But the whole thing, it's a damn puzzle, a house of cards with too many pieces.  Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL – they’re all tools, but no one tool can fix it. It takes a hand, a mind, a heart. It takes all of us.",
            "The rain came down hard on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the night. We sat on the porch, the air thick with smoke and the smell of wet earth. He was thinner now, my father, his clothes hanging like shrouds. His eyes, though, they still held that same distant light, the kind that looked past the here and now, into some faraway shore.  I asked him about his favorite bird, the way you do when words fail and silence stretches too long. \"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice a rasp.  He watched the water run off the eaves, the gutters overflowing like black rivers into the thirsty earth.\n\nWe'd been told, all of us, that there was something beyond. Something vast and unknowable, waiting out there in the dark.  Some found solace in temples and churches, others in the quiet roar of their own souls. But me, I'd always been drawn to the silence, the emptiness. I sought answers in the rustle of leaves, the whisper of wind through the trees.  \n\nMy father, he never spoke much about it.  Religion, faith, the big questions – they were like ghosts in our house, always present, but never named.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. Five days after the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. The chemo, the radiation, they just slowed the inevitable.  I didn't want to watch him fade. Didn't want to see the light leave his eyes. So I didn't. I couldn't.\n\nI remember him better this way, in the sunlight, laughing, sharing stories.  Not in the sterile white of a hospital room, his body wracked with pain.\n\nNo one called me when he died. \n\nMaybe they knew. Maybe they knew that I already had him in my heart, a shadow cast by the sun, a memory etched in the bark of a tree.",
            "The Gothic, a word clinging to the husk of its own meaning, an oxymoron twisted from \"Old-New,\" as that Watt fellow put it. Disparaged, praised, accused of emptiness, lauded for a terror that felt somehow grand.  Like a ship caught in a storm, tossed between the shore of the familiar and the edge of the unknown. Walpole, he saw it first, this shape taking form in the dark.  His *Castle of Otranto*, a ghost story spun from threads of the ancient and the modern.  He took the theatrics of the old, the shadows and whispers of forgotten playhouses, and wove them into the new cloth of the novel. A tapestry where the reader, a voyeur in the mind of the story, could see the soul laid bare.  \n\nThe word \"Gothic\" itself, a stain on the canvas of time, had been applied to everything from people to places, a descriptor for the archaic and the crude, a shadow cast upon the bright face of the modern world.  But in this collision, this marriage of the theatrical and the introspective, the Gothic found its foothold. It became a mirror, reflecting both the past and the present, a space where what was lost could be mourned and what was feared could be faced.\n\nAnd within this mirror, the figure of Chivalry rose.  Not the chivalrous knight of old, polished and pristine, but a ghost, a memory, a longing for a better world.  For Walpole, writing in a time of turmoil, the world seemed to be veering off course, the compass broken. He saw the knight, the embodiment of honor and courage, as a forgotten ideal, a beacon in the gathering darkness.  And in his novel, he painted Frederic, a prince, a warrior, a victim, as a flickering flame of that lost ideal.\n\nFrederic, described in words that echo with the cadence of bygone ages, is a figure draped in tragedy, a knight fallen from grace.  His story, a lament for a world that has lost its way.  He is the armor, rusted and worn, the sword dulled but still dangerous.  He is the last echo of a song long forgotten.",
            "The world turns on the back of a mule. Goods and men, both alike, shuffled along the worn tracks of need. From the first whisper of a want to the final sigh of a customer's hand on a purchased prize. A chain it is, forged from the cold steel of necessity. A chain forged back in eighty-two by a man named Oliver, a man who understood the rhythm of want and the song of the market. He spoke of planning, of planting seeds in the dark soil of production and watching them bloom into the fields of supply.  \n\nThere are six stones in this chain, each a facet of the whole. Production, the heart beating in the chest of the system. Supply, the lifeblood coursing through its veins. Inventory, the watchful eyes that measure and guard. Location, the bones that give it shape and form. Transportation, the wind that carries it forward. And information, the whispers that guide its path. \n\nProduction, they say, is where it all begins. It's the forge where raw materials are hammered into shape, where the will of the market is translated into tangible goods. Managers, they stand watch over this process, their minds sharp as scalpels, dissecting the wants and needs of the world. They study the market, a living beast with shifting appetites, and they learn its language. They know what it craves, what it desires, and they build their offerings accordingly.  \n\nThen comes supply, the art of choosing the right partners, the right tools, the right hands to bring the vision to life.  Outsourcing, they call it, a dance between collaboration and competition. To outsource is to choose speed, flexibility, and the promise of lower costs.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, its message a rasping whisper on the street corner. \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, face pale beneath the unforgiving glare of the streetlamps, held it aloft, the Sharpie scrawl stark against the cardboard. Burma. Myanmar. A land choked by a junta's iron fist, a place where the weight of history pressed down like a shroud. \n\nIt was 2007. Monks, saffron robes burning bright against the gray of the dawn, had risen. They walked, chanting, a tide of gold against the khaki. The Saffron Revolution.  A flicker of hope in the suffocating darkness. But the junta, a serpent coiled around the nation's throat, struck back.  \n\nMonasteries became battlegrounds. The air filled with the crack of gunfire, the wail of sirens, the cries of the dying. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were met with imprisonment, with death. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, bled out on the asphalt, his camera still clutched in his hand. \n\nThe official count was a whisper, a lie. Colonel Hla Win, his voice a broken echo from the heart of the storm, spoke of thousands swallowed by the dust, their names lost to the wind. \n\nThis wasn't new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was as old as the world itself.  Roman emperors, gods in their own right, ruled with an iron fist. Japanese emperors, their lineage woven into the fabric of the heavens, claimed dominion over the very souls of their people. And here, in the heart of America, the whispers spoke of a president, a man who sought communion with the darkness, who plotted with the shadows. \n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of humanity, demanding freedom, met with a storm of steel. The Red Cross whispered of thousands, the government of a few hundred. Their words, like the blood on the pavement, faded into the silence.\n\nRwanda, a decade later. Hutu against Tutsi, a genocide painted in blood. The Butcher of Kigali, a name whispered with fear, orchestrated a symphony of death.\n\nAnd then, the shadow of the Third Reich, a darkness that stretched across the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity. \n\nHitler. Alive in Burma? The sign creaked, a mournful echo in the empty street. Was it a truth too terrible to bear? Or a lie whispered to keep the world watching, afraid?",
            "The man came to see it like this: Duke Ellington’s ghost lived in the music. Not in the piano notes, not much, but in the space between. The space where a man named Bubber Miley could blow a muted trumpet and it sounded like a voice crying out, and where a girl named Baby Cox could scat and it sounded like rain on a tin roof. It was the space where Ellington, his heart and bones, had shaped the sound of the band, made it his own.\n\nHe’d taken those raw notes, those souls set to play, and he’d wove them into something new. A tapestry of sound, each thread a voice, a horn, a beat, all singing together. It wasn’t just the melodies, though those were fine enough. It was the spaces between the notes, the silences, the whispers that made it breathe.  \n\nLike in “Creole Love Call,” that song was a slow burn, a love letter in twelve bars.  The first chorus, the voice and the reeds, a conversation, soft and then rough, like a memory coming back. The trumpet, muted, it wept blues, each note drawn out, dripping with sorrow. The clarinet, it soared high, a lonely bird in the sky. And then the whole band, a chorus of voices, echoing the cry.\n\nAnd then, the last chorus, the voice, it growled, like a beast waking. It wasn’t singing anymore, it was playing, an instrument of the soul.  And then a trombone, a final note, a shiver, a ghost in the wind.\n\nEllington, he knew how to make a sound, how to make it sing. Like in “Hot and Bothered,” the trumpet and the scat, they danced, they argued, they laughed. A conversation in a foreign tongue, understood only by the ears. And in “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” that trombone, it spoke the melody, a low rumble, a promise.\n\nHe’d crafted a world of sound, and in it, he’d made a home.",
            "The ache had been with her, a gnawing emptiness, since she was fourteen. A yearning for something nameless, something unclaimed.  A thirst not quenched by things, but by the touch of another soul.  Boys hadn't interested her, their clumsy advances like moths drawn to a light they couldn't understand. She’d studied herself, dissected her own heart, seeking the reason for this strange, quiet longing. Theories formed and dissipated like smoke in the wind, leaving her with only the echo of the question: why?\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a calm woven from the threads of her parents' gentle natures. Arguments were rare, like storms passing over a still lake. Her own spirit, however, was a restless flame, a wildfire of energy that danced at odds with their placidity. Yet, they loved her, embraced her wildness as a part of their own, a counterpoint to their harmony.\n\nBut today, the peace was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice, thin and strained, sliced through the air. It came from the kitchen, a sharp note of pain.  Panic gripped her.  \"Mom? Mom, what is it?\" she cried, her words tumbling over themselves as she rushed into the room. \n\nThere she was, her mother, fallen on the floor, her face contorted in agony. \"Ow...sweet...hospital...\" her words were fragmented, each one a shard of glass. Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of helplessness washing over her. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice firm despite the tremor in her heart, \"Just tell me where to take you.\"  \n\nHer mother, her hand trembling, pointed towards the car.  And in that moment, the strength she had cultivated in her own body, honed through years of disciplined practice, surged to the forefront. She lifted her mother, her own muscles straining against the weight, and carried her to the car.  She deposited her gently in the backseat and drove, the world a blur of motion and worry.\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but those weren't the scents that dominated her senses.  It was the raw, sickening fear for her mother that filled her lungs, a suffocating tide. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea in the echoing halls.  Doctors and nurses converged, their faces etched with concern.  \n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf. A simple misstep, an accident, but for now it felt like a betrayal, a violation of the sanctity of their peaceful home.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the study. A whisper on the wind told of the Mediterranean Diet, a way of life built on sun-bleached stones and olive groves.  They called it the aMed diet, a reckoning of the choices laid bare on a plate: more of the earth's bounty – the fruits, the nuts, the grains, the legumes – and less of the animal's flesh, less of the fat that choked the veins.  They measured its worth against the specter of heart disease, seeking a haven in the shadow of a stroke.\n\nOld tales spoke of a light in the belly of the Mediterranean, a glow against the encroaching darkness of sickness.  They'd followed the path of olive oil, a slick trail across the years, and seen a flicker in the lives of those who walked it.  But this time, the whispers focused on the storm – the stroke, the sudden shattering of the vessel.\n\nThey gathered the women, seventy-four thousand strong, their lives unfolding like maps across the land. They were daughters of the earth, nurses tending to a nation's wounds.  From the year 1984 to 2004, six times they held out their hands, offering up their memories of meals past. Each bite, a brushstroke on a canvas of health, recorded in the faded ink of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nAnd they watched, these women, their gazes fixed on the horizon of their own mortality.  The years marched on, relentless as the tide.  Some fell, struck down by the shadow of heart disease, others by the relentless hand of stroke. The stories of their lives, etched in hospital records and death certificates, served as the testament.  \n\nThe women in the highest ranks of the aMed diet, their plates brimming with the earth's bounty, stood tall against the storm.  Their risk, a whisper in the wind, compared to those who had strayed from the path.  The aMed diet, a shield against the darkness, a testament to the enduring strength of the earth's embrace.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, it choked. A sickness spread through the veins of the American economy. Banks, fat and bloated, lay sick with bad blood, their arteries clogged with promises they couldn't keep. The houses, them towers of folly, began to crumble, their foundations built on sand and deceit. Men in suits, eyes glazed with greed, had gambled with the nation's wealth, playing fast and loose with the lives of ordinary folk. \n\nThey called it a crisis. A recession. But it was more than that. It was the death rattle of a dream, the slow, grinding halt of a machine built on lies.  It began in the shadows, in the backrooms of Washington, where the whispers of deregulation slithered through the halls of power. Clinton, he'd chased re-election like a hound on a scent, his nose pressed to the ground, sniffing out the sweet aroma of popularity. He loosened the reins, let the banks run wild, fueled by the cheap blood of sub-prime loans.\n\nAnd the vultures, they circled. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these paper tigers, they devoured the bad meat, packaging it into CDOs and CDSs, a toxic stew of debt that would poison the whole nation. The banks, drunk on their own hubris, piled on, chasing profits with reckless abandon.\n\nThe houses, they rose like monuments to folly, ticking time bombs on the landscape. Adjustable rates, they were called, a seductive promise of cheap dreams made flesh. But the music stopped, and the piper came calling. The payments, they couldn't be met. The houses, they fell. And the blood began to flow.\n\nThe market, it crashed. The banks, they choked. The economy, it shuddered and died. Five trillion dollars, it vanished like smoke in the wind. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, names that once whispered of power, now reduced to dust. \n\nAnd the people, they paid the price. Jobs lost, homes foreclosed, dreams shattered. A generation scarred, forever marked by the stench of failure.\n\nWe stand now, in the ashes of their folly. The question isn't how did it happen? But what will we do about it? Will we learn from the mistakes of the past? Or will we stumble blindly into another abyss, repeating the same sins again and again?",
            "The wind whipped at the gas station, rattling the empty windows like skeletal fingers tapping on glass.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and decay, a graveyard aroma that clung to everything.  He stood on the cracked asphalt, the wind tearing at his threadbare coat.  He thought of the man, the night manager, the man with the tired eyes and the haunted look.  A man who once wore a uniform, a man who traded the roar of engines for the hum of fluorescent lights.  He imagined the man's hands, calloused from years of gripping a fishing rod, now clutching a tired, worn-out rag as he wiped down the counter, the ghosts of breakfast plates and greasy coffee cups still lingering in the air.  He pictured the man's face, etched with the lines of a life lived under a harsh sun, now shadowed by a past he couldn't escape.\n\nHe'd met him once, years ago, a fleeting glimpse in a barroom, a shared glance over a glass of whiskey.  A man who'd seen too much, who carried the weight of untold stories in his eyes.  He'd heard whispers of him, rumors of a past life, of a wife and child lost to the dust and the wind.  He'd heard of the gas station, a lonely outpost on the edge of oblivion, where dreams went to die and memories clung to the air like smoke.\n\nHe turned away, his gaze drawn to the horizon, where the sun bled into the dust-filled sky.  The wind whispered through the empty windows of the gas station, a mournful echo of a life half-lived.  The man was gone, swallowed by the desert, a forgotten soul in a forgotten place.  And here he stood, a stranger in a strange land, searching for a story, a connection, a spark of hope in the vast emptiness.",
            "The television hummed, a pallid light flickering across the worn face of the man in the worn chair. Two stories from Columbus. The first, a man named Hostettler, eyes like a pit in the dark, had taken his wife in Ashley. Multiple times, they said, the blade flashing. Two minutes, that's all it took. A fleck of dust in the vast machine. The second, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, found shattered in the woods. No names, no faces, only the echo of a gunshot. SWAT combing the shadows, searching for a whisper in the wind. The  night had swallowed him whole.\n\nThen the Med-Flight, a hole punched clean through its belly by a .22. Five thousand dollars for the truth, they promised. But the truth held its tongue, silent in the dark. The rain was coming, they said, a hot, heavy blanket falling on the city. They spoke of temperatures, of the weekend stretching before, a blank canvas.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF. A black man, they said, hoodie pulled low. Six foot tall, a shadow in the night. They lingered on the color, on the details of his darkness.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a kingpin they called him, drugs flowing from Texas like a poisoned river.  Not twenty-five years, no, three hundred months. The number hung in the air, a harsh and hollow clang. A Hispanic, they added, a footnote in the story.\n\nThe screen went dark. Only the hum remained, a low, keening sound. The man in the chair stared at the blankness, a hollow space mirroring the emptiness within.",
            "The blood ties. They run deep. A river black and cold with the mud of forgotten things. Love, hate, envy, the raw knot of them all tangled up inside. Brothers. They see themselves in one another's eyes, clear as the bones beneath the skin. It's in the bad times, the bone-deep dark, that the truth of it shines through. A fire that burns with a pale, gray light.\n\nThere's a cost to this knowledge. A price paid in blood and silence. You look into your brother's eyes and you see not the man the world sees, but the man he truly is. The man he hides from himself. The man he wants to be. And in the wreckage of his actions, you see your own reflection.\n\nDown in the swamps, two brothers walk a path choked with Spanish moss. A path worn smooth by the weight of their unspoken words. One brother, strong, his heart a drumbeat in his chest. The other, frail, his spirit a whisper on the wind. \n\nThey walk towards a storm.\n\nPride, a hard stone in the elder brother's chest. He wants to shape his brother, mold him into the image he himself craves. But the younger brother, he is porcelain, easily broken.\n\nThe landscape, it bleeds with this tension. A symphony of green and decay. The air thick with the smell of rain and death.\n\nAnd in the end, only one will survive.\n\nThe final scene, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow and regret. A brother, broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of his own ambition. The other, left standing, a hollow shell, his victory a bitter taste on his tongue.",
            "The mind, it's a dark and tangled thing. Not a machine, though they try to make it so. A box, a book, a goddamn computer – ain't none of it true. It's more like a well, a fathomless well of echoes. Takes in the raw whispers of the world – touch, sound, light – and twists them into something else. Something new. Something…imagined. \n\nSee, the world ain't just what you see. You see a box, black on white, sure. But the mind, it's already building a story around it. A box with what inside? A door? A secret? A whisper of fear? It's a dance, this seeing, a constant back-and-forth between what is and what could be.\n\nAnd then there's the filter. The curtain that falls, choosing what to let through, what to hold back. It's a cruel gatekeeper, letting in the blade of grass you step on, but shutting out the whispers of a thousand unseen things.\n\nBut it's a lonely thing, this well. Memory, it's the only company it has.  A storehouse of ghosts, of things seen and heard and felt. Some fleeting, some clinging on, whispering in the dark.\n\nAnd how it's all organized, that's the real mystery. A tangled web, a map without a guide. Some say it's all connected, a web of meaning spun from the threads of experience. Others say it's shattered, a mosaic of fragments, each one a piece of the whole, but broken beyond repair.\n\nWhatever it is, it's a wonder. A terrifying, beautiful, and ultimately unknowable thing. The mind, it's the last frontier. A wilderness we're only just beginning to explore.",
            "The words of Huxley, a man who saw the shadows lengthening, who felt the chill of a future unblinking in its glass and steel embrace. He laid bare the coming darkness in Brave New World, a vision of a world consumed by its own creation. A world where community choked the individual, where happiness was a manufactured drug, dispensed in measured doses by the World Controller, a puppet master pulling the strings of a society lulled into a synthetic stupor.\n\nHe speaks of technology, a serpent slithering through the veins of humanity, promised as salvation but bearing the venom of its own undoing.  He speaks of capitalism, a machine grinding down the human spirit, its gears oiled by the insatiable hunger for more, for consumption, for the illusion of fulfillment.\n\nMarxism, that ancient scripture of the downtrodden, whispers through the pages of Huxley's work.  Homogeny, the crushing weight of sameness, smothers the soul. Reification, the cold objectification of human beings into mere cogs in the machine, stares back from the vacant eyes of the World State's citizens. \n\nFalse consciousness, that insidious veil woven over the eyes of the masses, blinds them to the true nature of their servitude.  The proletariat, trapped in a web of manufactured desires, their yearning for true connection replaced by the hollow comfort of fleeting pleasures. \n\nHegemony, the iron fist of the ruling class, clenches around the throat of the world, silencing dissent and crushing any flicker of rebellion. The lower castes, the Deltas, Gammas, Epsilons, are mere cattle, herded and controlled, their minds dulled by the endless hum of consumerism.\n\nAnd what of love? What of the burning intensity of human connection?  In this sterile world, it is a forgotten language, a whisper lost in the din of the manufactured masses.  Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth, a hollow echo of the real thing.\n\nHuxley's vision is a bleak one, a warning whispered across the chasm of time. A reminder that the pursuit of progress, untethered from the embrace of humanity, can lead only to a cold and desolate wasteland.",
            "The road to knowledge, they say, is paved with time. But here, on this campus, the road is more like a dust trail, thin and winding, stretching out under a sky ate up by steel and glass. Two and a half years I've walked these paths, measured them in the relentless tick of each clock in each building. East Halls they called it, my first home, a godforsaken outpost, a world away from the heart of things. Willard, they said, a name like a whisper from the past, a place of learning, a place of dust motes dancing in the sunbeams. But to reach it, it felt like crossing a wasteland.\n\nThey built up this place, brick by brick, hope by hope, a monument to progress. The fields, the empty fields, they used to whisper of something else. Something wilder. Now they're choked with concrete and steel, monuments to the ever-growing hunger of this place.\n\nThe answer, they say, is simple: a bicycle. A machine of two wheels and steel, a promise of speed and freedom. But the bicycle is a tool, a weapon in the hands of a warrior. It needs a landscape built for it, a world where the wind whispers through the spokes and the road unfolds like a ribbon under its tires.\n\nMy friend, he came back to it, to the bicycle, after years lost in the shadows of the everyday. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his words rasping like dry leaves.\n\nAnd he's right. My own legs have learned the rhythm of the wheels, the cadence of the pavement. Twenty-five minutes, they say, to walk to Thomas building. But the bicycle, it whispers a different truth. Five minutes, a blur of metal and movement, a rush of wind against my face.\n\nYet even the bicycle stumbles against the reality of this place. Pollock Road, a scar across the landscape, a reminder of the old world swallowed by the new. The wind bites, the rain stings, and the road itself seems to resist the passage of time.\n\nBut the bicycle, it is a defiance, a small act of rebellion against the slow crush of the everyday. It is a reminder that even in a world built for cars and concrete, there is still room for the simple act of motion, the whisper of wheels against pavement, the rhythm of the heart beating in time with the pedals."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The road stretched bleak and gray, a ribbon of ash against the dying light.  Like the boy himself, it was thin and fragile, haunted by the ghosts of what had been.  He'd walk it for him, mile by mile, if it took a lifetime.  His education, a road paved with good intent, led him here, to this desolate place.  He'd heard the whispers, seen the shadows of neglect, the cracks in the foundation of families.  It was a sickness in the marrow of things, a slow rot that devoured innocence.  \n\nHe'd seen it in the eyes of that boy, the one who'd sought refuge in his friend's home, a sanctuary built on shaky ground.  The boy's silence spoke volumes, his fear a palpable thing in the stale summer air.  The parents, cloaked in their own justifications, blind to the damage they wrought. The boy needed a haven, a place where his voice could be heard, where the tremor in his hands wouldn't be dismissed as weakness. That's where he came in.  \n\nHe'd learned the language of brokenness, the code of the abandoned, the whispers of the unseen. His psychology degree, a shield against the darkness, had given him the tools, the understanding. But it was more than that. It was a fire, a burning need to mend the jagged edges of lives torn apart.\n\nHe believed in service, in the quiet dignity of respect, in the unwavering compass of ethical conduct.  These weren't just words, but the very bedrock of his being.  He'd learned from the ashes of his own past, the scars etched deep, the lessons forged in pain.\n\nSocial justice, a flickering flame in a world shrouded in darkness.  It was a fight, a battle against the tide of complacency, the apathy that masked the suffering of the voiceless.  He saw it in the faces of the forgotten, the marginalized, the ones who dared to be different.  He'd stood with them, his voice a defiant echo against the silence.  He'd fight for them, for the boy on the couch, for a world where every soul mattered. \n\nThis was his calling, his destiny.  He would walk the path, however long, however arduous, until the road to justice was paved with hope.",
            "The dark came down slow, a shroud over the land. This was a story of sleep, or the lack of it. A sickness of the mind, they called it, insomnia. Some said it was in the blood, a shadow passed down from father to son, a ghost in the genes. Others said it was the world that wore you down, the weight of it pressing on your chest, the endless grind of living. \n\nThey talked of models, of biology and society, of how the body and the world conspired to steal your rest. They spoke of neurons firing in the dark, of chemicals in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a silent conductor orchestrating the symphony of sleep. They studied mice, those pale shadows of men, and found a receptor, a keyhole in the brain where a drug could fit, a lock that, if broken, could unlock the door to slumber. \n\nBut what of the man who lay awake, staring at the ceiling, the dust motes dancing in the moonlight? What of the woman whose mind raced, a torrent of thoughts flooding her like a rising tide? The world wasn't just made of genes and chemicals. It was made of stories, of fear and hope, of love and loss. The world could crack a man's soul, steal his peace, and leave him hollow and empty.\n\nThey spoke of race, of poverty, of the burden of history, of how the world's injustices could wear a man down, keep him from finding solace in sleep. They spoke of the color of skin, the language spoken, the life lived, and how these things could shape a man's destiny, even in the darkness of sleeplessness.",
            "The whispering dark of the mind, that’s what this is. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it.  A snag in the way the world speaks, the way the sounds get sorted and understood. The ears hear, sure, but the message gets lost somewhere between the soundwaves and the meanings. A wilderness in the mind, where words scatter and confusion takes root. They call it CAPD, or APD, but it’s a name for a silence, a hollowness where meaning should be. \n\nThey’ve been picking at the edges of this silence for decades, these doctors and researchers. Back in the fifties, they called it “auditory imperception,” a faint echo in the halls of understanding. They started prodding and poking, trying to find the source of the deafness in the soul. Kimura, Bocca, Calearo, names whispered in hushed tones in the halls of science, trying to map the terrain of this hidden darkness.\n\nAnd the darkness shows itself in a thousand ways.  Lost in the echo chamber of the mind, a child might not know where a sound is coming from, or which voice is speaking. Words blend together, a river of sound with no banks, no shores.  A joke, a change in tone, a whisper of sarcasm – all lost in the wash. Some days, sound is a jumble, a dense fog that obscures meaning.\n\nFinding this silence, this deafness in the soul, it’s a slow, careful process.  A teacher watches a child struggle, observes the way they turn their head, the way their eyes search for the source of sound. They listen for the gaps, the moments when the child is lost in the maelstrom of sound.  Questionnaires, tests, a symphony of stimuli designed to break through the fog. \n\nBut there are no easy answers, no single test that unlocks the secrets of this silent world. The cause, shrouded in mystery, remains elusive. A whispered question in the darkness, unanswered.",

The longer you wear the mask, the harder it is to see the man beneath. You lose yourself in the lie, a ghost in your own life.  And when the mask is torn away, when the truth comes crashing down - well, there's a kind of death that comes with that. A death of the old self, the one you thought you were.\n\nDeception, it's a double-edged blade. It can save you, or it can destroy you.  And the deeper the deceit, the more dangerous it becomes.  To play at being another, to walk in stolen shoes - that's a perilous path. Viola, she knew this. She had to disguise herself, to become Cesario, to survive. But in doing so, she closed herself off from the world, from the sisters of her kind. \n\nAnd then, the more twisted the web becomes. Olivia, she falls for Cesario, for the phantom that Viola has become. A love born of illusion, a love built on a lie. And Orsino, he pines for Cesario, unaware of the woman who bleeds beneath the borrowed skin.  It's a dance of the damned, this play of shadows. They are all trapped, bound by a lie they cannot escape.\n\nThe play asks a question: can we ever truly know who another is, or are we always seeing a reflection in a distorted mirror? And can we ever forgive ourselves, or those we love, for the masks they wear? These are the questions that linger, long after the curtain falls.",

And within that tapestry, the threads of education ran different.  \n\nIn Tanganyika, the British walked in and found a people literate, a people reading. The Germans, they'd planted seeds there, watered them with knowledge. Kamerun too, whispers say, flourished under their tutelage.  But in this land, South West Africa, a different story unfolded.  A barren land, harsh and unforgiving, mirroring the spirit of the men who held dominion over it. \n\nHere, the schools were not the province of the state, no, that was left to the missionaries, these men with their Bibles and their hunger for souls.  The government, they poured resources into the education of their own, building schools, shaping minds in their own image.  But for the natives, for the black men and women, the path to literacy was a dusty, forgotten trail. \n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other German colonies boasted educated Africans, here, the vast majority remained silent, illiterate, swallowed by the silence of their own ignorance. \n\nWhat brought about this stark contrast? What drove the Germans to this systematic neglect? This paper seeks to delve into the heart of this paradox, to expose the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial masters, the fear and the prejudice that shaped this desolate landscape of learning.  \n\nThe records tell their stories, these dusty tomes written in languages both familiar and foreign. They speak of schools and systems, of progress and neglect, of the clash of cultures and the triumph of blindness.  Cohen, he wrote about this, about the stark difference between East and West Africa. He saw the settlers, the driving force behind this educational apartheid, the key to understanding this land's silent sorrow.\n\nThis land, South West Africa, a land of harsh beauty, a land where the sun beat down mercilessly, where the wind carried the whispers of forgotten languages.

They saw them as obstacles, as shadows to be ignored.",
            "The dust of a hundred years has settled on the music, blurring the lines between genres. A hundred years of names piled high, each one a branch on the sprawling, thorny tree of Popular Music: Rock, Folk, Jazz, Country, Rap - a lexicon of sound, and beneath each branch, a thousand more.  Heavy Metal, born in the grimy crucible of the last forty years, is a testament to that chaos, a symphony of shadows and screams.\n\nIt’s a music of excess, a music of depth. It cuts, it bleeds, it aches with a raw intensity that bleeds from the depths of the soul. It is not a gentle music, but a music that wrestles with the darkness, that stares into the abyss and screams back.   \n\nFrom the beginning, the seeds of rebellion were sown. The first tendrils of Metal snaked out, branching into a thousand unholy offshoots.

It has swallowed whole the traditions of other genres, twisting them into something new, something savage. Its roots run deep, drawing sustenance from the primal darkness that whispers at the edge of our dreams.\n\nBut to truly understand this beast, to grasp the essence of its fury, one must first go back to its source.  Go back to the moment when darkness gave birth to sound, when chaos became a symphony.\n\nFor Metal is not merely a genre, it is a movement. A movement fueled by a hunger for something more, something real, something primal. A movement born of drugs, of despair, of the desperate need to express the darkness that festers within us all. \n\nIt is a music that sings of anger, of pain, of the fragility of existence. It is a music that does not shy away from the shadows, but embraces them. \n\nAnd in those shadows, in the heart of the storm, we find the true soul of Metal.",
            "The man in the smoky room, the one they called Rousseau, he'd been painting his dreams for years. Not the kind that come in the dead of night, but the ones that woke him with the rasp of want. Dreams of color, of light, of a canvas that breathed back at him. A dream of seeing his name etched in the annals of art, not the back of some dusty ledger. But the world, it spat on dreams like a dog on a bone.  \n\nHe'd been a customs man, a gabelou they called him, a tollkeeper on the edge of things.  The work kept him fed, but it choked his soul. He yearned to paint, to build worlds with brushstrokes and pigment, to show them what lay hidden beneath the surface of things. He started late, a man pushing forty with calloused hands and a heart full of longing.\n\nHe'd seen the work of those fine artists, the ones who flitted about Paris like moths to a flame. They painted with ease, with a confidence he could only dream of. He yearned to be like them, to be recognized, to be heard. But his work, it was different. Raw. Unpolished. A whisper in a shout.\n\nHe painted his dreams, the ones that haunted him, the ones that both terrified and comforted him. He painted jungles teeming with life, women draped in moonlight, landscapes that stretched out into eternity. He painted what he saw, what he felt, what he yearned for.\n\nBut the art world, it was a cold mistress. She demanded conformity, obedience. She wanted artists who followed the rules, who painted what she told them to paint. And Rousseau, he refused. He painted his truth, his own vision of the world. \n\nHis \"Dream,\" that's what they called it. A woman lost in a world of fantasy, a world of his own making. A world where the impossible was real, where the mundane was magical. He poured his heart and soul into that painting, his longing, his frustration, his defiance. \n\nHe knew they wouldn't understand. He knew they'd scorn him, dismiss him as a naive fool. But he didn't care. He painted for himself, for the sake of the dream. Because in the end, it was his dream, and his alone.",
            "The air  hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A truth hung there too, unspoken, a thing that sat heavy in the chest like a stone. The old men, the thinkers, they'd said it for years – that beauty and truth were two sides of the same coin, bound together by some unseen thread.  Like Keats in his poems, they'd whispered of beauty as truth, and truth as beauty.  But what did it mean? What did it mean to know a truth so deep it felt like a wound, a truth so raw it bled into the very fabric of your being?\n\nWe learn things, sure. We cram facts and figures into our heads, soak up knowledge like a sponge. But these truths, these ethical knots, these aesthetic pangs, they weren't learned things. They burrowed into you, took root, bloomed in the dark places of the soul. We try to explain them, dissect them, analyze them like specimens under a glass.  We talk about brushstrokes and bone structures, moral codes and personal narratives.  But it's not enough. Something always remains, a shadow across the light, an echo in the silence.  \n\nTake a picture, for instance.  You can break down the composition, the light, the shadows. You can say it's a masterpiece or a sham, a snapshot of a moment in time. But that doesn't tell you why it grabs you by the throat and squeezes, why it leaves you breathless and hollow-eyed. It's that something else, the ineffable, the unspoken. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, sometimes the truth is just too big to say. It has to be told, woven into a story, a tapestry of words that bleeds with feeling.  And like Wittgenstein, I believe there are truths that can't be spoken, only felt.  They're out there, in the liminal spaces, the spaces between the lines, the spaces where the soul breathes. \n\nMaybe that's why art and ethics are so intertwined. Because they both speak to that ultimate truth, the one that lies just beyond our grasp.  They show us the world, not as it is, but as it could be, as it might have been, as it yearns to be. They teach us to see the beauty in the broken, the meaning in the meaningless, the hope in the ashes.",
            "The wind scrapes across the plains of Germany.  A cold wind. A wind that whispers stories of iron and fire, of tribes that fought beneath a sky the color of pewter.  From the shadowed Alps where Munich stands, its breath held tight against the chill, to the salt-laced air of Kiel on the Baltic, it carries the same scent:  a blend of earth and ash, of ancient wood smoke.  The Rhine winds through Köln, a serpent of silver, and the Saxon city of Dresden, born on the Elbe, echoes its song. This is a land conjoined from fragments, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, woven together by the threads of time.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost on the wind, clings to the land like the scent of pine needles.  Its meaning, lost in the mists of ages, is a bone gnawed clean by time. Tacitus, that chronicler of shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that had crossed the Rhine, leaving behind a trail of fire and steel. Their battles with the Gauls, he wrote, were like storms, their fury a tide that swept across the land. Caesar, the Roman eagle, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicle of conquest. He used it to mark the boundary between the conquered and the unconquered, a line drawn in blood and iron. Some whisper that the word came from the Gauls themselves, a word that carried the sting of fear, a sound that meant \"those who dwell beyond the river.\" Others say it came from the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon that danced in the hands of warriors, a whisper of death on the wind.  \n\nTacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched by the tide of civilization.  He saw them as primordial, untouched by the migrations and wars that shaped the world. Their lands, he wrote, were wild, their skies a canvas of storms, their faces etched with the harsh beauty of the north.  Who would leave the warmth of Rome, the comfort of vast cities, for the harsh embrace of Germania? Only those who were born of its soil, who knew its secrets, who spoke its language.\n\nRome, for all its might, never fully conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking riches and glory, but they never truly possessed its heart. They traded with the tribes, they fought with them, and they took what they could, but in the end, they retreated, leaving behind a land that remained stubbornly free.  \n\nAnd so, Germania lived on. A land of forests and mountains, of rivers and plains, a land of indomitable spirit. A land whose story is still being written.",
            "The water stared back, a mirror of the abyss in my gut. Brown. Just brown.  No swirls, no play of light.  It was a truth laid bare, a solid, unyielding thing.  Thoughts, like flies, buzzed around the edges, skittering and fleeting.  None of them settled.  This wasn't art. It wasn't even the beginning of a story. More like the end.  The final, ugly scene.\n\nI'd read somewhere, maybe in one of those art books, about how to see. To strip things down. To find the essential line, the core of the thing.  Like a frame around a bowl of fruit, they said.  But there was no frame for this. Just the brown, and the stink. \n\nPicasso, Monet, they all had their colors. Their worlds.  My world was brown.  This brown.  The brown of regret, the brown of failure.\n\nMy hand gripped the handle, knuckles white.  Muscle memory took over, a practiced movement. But this time, it felt wrong.  The water stirred, a ripple of disgust. A piece broke free, a dark, shapeless thing.  It drifted, then sank.  I tried again. The flush, a weak sigh.  Still there.\n\nThe mop lay limp in my hand, a useless white flag.  A green tie choked me, a symbol of some forgotten occasion.  I stared at the brown, my mind a blank slate.  No thoughts, no inspiration, just the weight of it.\n\nThe toilet paper, a thin sheet of hope, felt flimsy against the cold porcelain.  I wrapped it, layer by layer, a shroud.  My hand, buried deep, felt the slickness, the cold.  A mother's touch, they said, but this wasn't love.  It was resignation.\n\nThe brown held fast.",
            "The road is a graveyard for boys.  A blacktop river choked with the bones of youth. Too many of them, slick and young, behind the wheel, their eyes bright with the recklessness of a dawn that never comes. It's in their blood, this need for speed, this hunger for the open road. The doctors say their minds ain't built for it, that the circuits ain't fused, the wires ain't set. But they crave it all the same, the rush, the feeling of being untouchable. And they die for it, these boys, in a thousand twisted heaps of metal and glass.\n\nCalifornia, they say, tried to hold them back, to clip their wings with their licenses, to make them wait, to teach them patience. But patience ain't a virtue these young ones understand. They're driven by something else, something primal, something that whispers in their ears, urging them forward, whispering of freedom and of escape.\n\nZuckerman, the psychologist, he knows. He sees it in their eyes,  the glint of the abyss, the yearning for the fall. They want to feel alive, to test the boundaries, to see how close they can get to the edge before they lose their grip.\n\nAnd the edge is always there, waiting. A curve in the road, a patch of black ice, a reckless passenger, a sudden phone call. All it takes is a moment, a split second, and the world can be turned upside down.\n\nThey say millions more are coming, these children of the boomers, ready to take their place behind the wheel. They'll learn the same lessons, the hard way, the way all their predecessors have.\n\nMaybe there's a way to stop it, to turn the tide. Maybe there's a way to teach them to wait, to find their freedom in other ways, to understand the weight of the responsibility they carry. \n\nBut for now, the road remains a graveyard.  And the boys keep coming, drawn to its seductive danger, their hearts beating a reckless rhythm against the cold steel of their fate.",
            "In the dim glow of the Library of Congress archives, I sifted through Edison's dusty films, a collection of trickery from the nascent days of cinema. Fifteen flickers of artifice, cobbled together between '95 and '01. Illusions spun from the alchemy of editing, each frame a whisper of magic. My gaze fell upon these early attempts, seeking the poetics woven into their silent narratives. Some adhered to the stark simplicity of the time, others dared to breach the boundaries.\n\nThese phantoms of the silver screen, they were tethered to their stage. A proscenium arch framing each tableau, the camera a watchful eye, unmoving, fixed in its gaze. A stage borrowed from the theatre, a legacy of vaudeville, a whisper of the magic lantern. Figures danced within this confined space, confined to movements side to side, their paths never leading toward or away from the lens.  \n\nConsider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a 1900 apparition. Actors enter from the right, their journey confined to the horizontal plane, vanishing off-screen, leaving the camera behind, uncaring.\n\nLong shots, and occasionally a glimpse of the medium, were the only windows into this world. Close-ups? A foreign concept, unheard of in these spectral halls. A relic of the stage, where the entire tableau unfolded before the audience, framed by the proscenium's embrace.\n\nEach trick, a self-contained unit. One thought, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting breath in time. A vaudeville skit, a magic trick, a vanishing act, all compressed into a silent symphony. A single concept, a single shot, a single breath. But trickery, as it is wont to do, hides its seams. One conceptual shot, a phantom in the viewer's eye, may be a tapestry woven from multiple threads, each frame a stitch in the illusion.\n\nObserve \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a film from 1895. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, the moment where the severed head appears, a phantom born of artifice.",
            "The wind scoured the plains of Carolina, a constant, bleak presence. John Taylor, a man forged in the crucible of soil and sun, knew its bite as well as he knew the feel of weathered wood beneath his calloused hands.  He was a man of words, a man of purpose, his life a testament to the grit of the land he tilled. But his mind was a fortress, its walls built of conviction and the unwavering belief in a government that served the land, not the other way around.  He saw himself as a shepherd, guiding the flock of men toward a pasture of liberty, a land where the tiller of the soil held dominion.\n\nThis land, this republic, was a blank canvas, a chance to paint a masterpiece of freedom. He'd seen the rot of old ways, the shackles of tradition holding men down like bound cattle. He believed in the inherent goodness of man, a spark that needed only the right conditions to ignite.  But that spark, he knew, could also be twisted, consumed by greed and ambition. \n\nThat's why he fought for a government as lean and unforgiving as the winter winds, a government that kept its distance, allowing men to shape their own destinies.  He saw the danger in a leviathan, its tentacles reaching into every corner of life, smothering the very soul of independence.  He believed in a Constitution that was a sacred covenant, its words etched not in stone, but in the blood and sweat of men who yearned for freedom.  The Declaration, a beacon in the night, its light guiding them toward a future where the individual mattered, where the land was not a prize to be plundered but a birthright to be cherished.\n\n\n\nHe saw the world in shades of black and white, good and evil, a constant struggle between the two.  He saw the inherent flaws in man, the lust for power that gnawed at the heart of every leader, but he also saw the potential for greatness, the yearning for a world where every man could stand tall, unburdened by the yoke of tyranny.  He knew that the path was fraught with peril, that the wolves of despotism prowled the shadows, waiting to devour the innocent. But he clung to the belief that man, in his own time, could rise above his baser instincts and build a world worthy of the sacrifices made by those who came before.",
            "A cold wind blew through the pines. The figures in the logs, they dropped like stones in the third month. A sudden, hard fall. Disheartening. Winter had come to the campus, a gray pall with the onset of frost. Fewer bicycles, fewer walkers on the road. December, the semester's end. The air thick with the scent of burnt sugar and the hollowness of empty halls. A time for books, for packing, for goodbyes.  Maybe the log slips had fallen from minds preoccupied with the year's leaving. And then, the holidays, a long exhale, a silence. The campus, nearly a ghost town, students scattered to their homes, the faculty gone. January, the new year, a thin sliver of light cutting through the darkness. Then February, a hollow month, a gray echo. \n\nThe project, a bright spark at first, a flare in the darkness. But the flame flickers, its light dimming. To fight this, they conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of fire in March. The logs, they rose again, a brief resurgence. \n\nThe truth is, this battle was fought on two fronts. One, the natural ebb and flow of fervor. The other, the hold of the car, a deep-rooted comfort in a land where freedom is measured in miles driven. A siren song.  \n\nTo entice, they offered gifts: tokens of appreciation, whispers of reward.  Gift certificates to local haunts, places of comfort and respite. But what if they'd offered more? A bicycle, a hybrid's sleek promise, the silent hum of an electric dream? Would that have held the line, kept the logs full? Perhaps.\n\nThe prizes, they remained constant throughout the project. A steady hand, a steady reward. But what if they had evolved, grown in value with the passing months? A promise of greater things, a crescendo of incentive.  Imagine, a whisper of a bicycle in December, then the full promise of a hybrid in January. A silent, seductive lure.",
            "The dust of the market swirls. A thing called an ETF, they call it. A traded fund. Like a stock, they say, but it holds a basket of things. An index, a commodity, maybe even a handful of other stocks.  They say it gives you the spread of an index fund, the  lean of a single stock. You can short it, they say, lever it, buy in small bites. But it ain't free. A commission, they call it, for every trade.  Like a toll on the road to wealth.\n\nAnd the ratios, the expense ratios, they whisper. Lower than a mutual fund, they say. But is that enough? Is the promise of diversification, this phantom word, truly there? Or is it a mirage in the desert of the market?\n\nThis, then, is our examination. We'll look at IHF, this ETF, and its top ten holdings. 63% of its body, they say. Will these scraps of the whole tell the story of the whole? Can a single ETF truly hold the same weight as a carefully picked handful of stocks? \n\nThe top ten, they are:  *[Insert table of holdings here]* \n\nWe'll weigh these ten, see how they hang on the scales of return and risk. We'll calculate their Beta, that measure of their dance with the market's tremors. We'll see if a portfolio built on these ten, in the proportions IHF holds them, can truly mirror the ETF itself. Or if it can dance a better dance.\n\nThe numbers whisper:\n\n* [Insert chart with Beta and return calculations here] *\n\nThe numbers sing a song of higher return, a lower swing. Maybe, just maybe, these ten can outpace the whole. But the whispers speak of another question: are these differences real? Or just the echoes of chance?\n\nWe'll need to look deeper, into the heart of these stocks, at their individual swings. We'll measure their standard deviations, their own dances with risk.  Will the sum of their swings be different from the swing of the whole?\n\nThe market holds its breath. The dust settles. We wait for the answer.",
            "The land of dreams, that phantasm Poe called Dream-Land, it holds shadows deep. In it, he whispers of Thulé, a name echoing from Virgil, a lost isle north of Britain's shore, the edge of the known world. Virgil, yes, but there's another wind whispering these words, a German wind. Poe, he drank deep from the well of German thought. \n\nKarl J. Arndt, he saw it clear, the kinship between Poe and Goethe's Mignon. He saw it in the lines, a mirrored grief.  Poe, he borrowed the echoes, some say, crafting his own melancholy in the shadow of the master. \n\nOxford whispers of Goethe's Faust, a towering figure in the landscape of German verse. Two parts, like a heartbeat, the first in 1808, the second in the year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Within that shadowed second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" unfolds. A king, broken by loss, his queen gone, a goblet left as a phantom reminder. He drinks, he weeps, he sees only the ghost of her face in the fading light. The cliff calls, the goblet falls, and he, like a shattered mirror, breaks himself upon the edge of oblivion. \n\nPoe, he knew this king, this mirror image of grief. Could he not see himself reflected there? In the echoing halls of \"Dream-Land,\" the king's despair finds a kindred spirit. In the desolate landscape of Poe's poem, the speaker wanders, haunted by the shades of lost friends, trapped in a world drained of color and life. \n\nThulé, a bookend to Poe's dreams, a final echo of loss. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they breathe the same air of sorrow. \n\nAnd Goethe? A giant, looming even in Poe's eyes, a master whose shadow stretched across the world. Poe, he knew the weight of that name.  Tennyson, he once said, a poem unto himself.  And Goethe? He, too, was a part of that world, woven into the fabric of Poe's imagination, a silent companion in the dark.",
            "The applesauce lay slick on the linoleum, a treacherous smear under the harsh fluorescent lights. A spill, they called it. But to Jennifer Palmer, it was a harbinger of pain.  A half hour. That’s all it took. Half an hour for a man to know, to be told, to turn from his dinner and do what was right. But Paul Martin, the manager, had chosen hunger over heed. Twice he was warned. Twice he dismissed the danger. Twice he let the slickness linger, a silent invitation to disaster. He knew. He knew the aisles of D&D Markets were slick with peril. He'd seen the others fall before, the five who'd stumbled and broken in the same year, victims of his negligence. But still, the applesauce remained, a testament to his callousness. He was a shepherd who ignored his flock, a captain who steered his ship into the storm. And now, Jennifer Palmer, a woman with dreams and a future, lay broken on the cold floor, her back a canvas for pain.\n\nA judge, they say, will not be kind to Martin. The law whispers of malice, of a disregard so profound, so willful, that it transcends mere negligence. It speaks of actions fueled not by mistake, but by a cold indifference to the suffering that might result. The question becomes, was Martin's choice to eat, to ignore, a choice born of malice? Did he know, deep in his heart, that he was playing with fire?  Did he know, and did he care? \n\nThe state of California offers a glimpse into the mind of a judge. They speak of \"despicable\" acts, of a disregard for the \"rights and safety\" of others. Can Martin's actions, his callous indifference, be labeled as such? \n\nThe evidence whispers: a manager warned twice, a spill left unattended, a woman shattered. The whispers grow louder, echoing the question: Was it malice that led to Jennifer Palmer's fall?",
            "The dust of the years had settled on that classroom, on the worn floorboards and the sweat-stained backs of the wooden chairs. Four years gone now, a blink in the long march of time. Islam, they called it. The word itself, sharp and foreign on the tongue. Back then, the air crackled with the heat of debate. Hostile? Was it a religion born of rage, a sword brandished against the world? Or was it something else entirely?  \n\nThe world had shifted since then, tilted on its axis like a drunken dancer. The towers had fallen, the dust had choked the sky, and the faces on the news had hardened, their eyes reflecting the fear. Islam, once demonized, now bathed in an unsettling light of tolerance. A president with a name like Borac Obama, a name whispered with suspicion, yet somehow embraced. The world, like a river, finds its own course, carving new paths through the bedrock of belief.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tangled thread woven through time, drew him in. He had known the tales, the conquest, the subjugation, the fire of faith forced down the throats of the unwilling. But this biography, it painted a different picture. A humble man, misunderstood, a voice crying in the wilderness. People drawn to him like moths to a flickering flame, not by the sword, but by the light in his eyes.\n\nYet, the echo of another story lingered, a ghost in the air. The miracles, the multiplying loaves and fishes, a mirror reflecting the deeds of a different prophet, a different savior. A flicker of unease, a suspicion that history was being rewritten,  a sacred narrative reshaped to fit a new mold.\n\nThe voices of the witnesses, distant echoes through the years, whispered their tales. But the distance, the layers of retelling, cast a shadow of doubt. Was it truth, or was it a carefully constructed edifice, built upon the shifting sands of hearsay?\n\nThe portrait that emerged, a man of gentleness and wisdom, seemed at odds with the historical record. The shadows of his past, the whispers of conquest and bloodshed, refused to be silenced.  Could they reconcile the man of peace with the warrior king? Could faith truly flourish in the crucible of violence?",

But the wind it shifted, time it turned, and the words themselves grew faint.  They became tangled in weeds, choked by the dust of forgetting.\n\nNow the world spins on, a wheel beneath a cold, indifferent sky. Progress, they call it.  Men march forward, their eyes fixed on the horizon, blind to the bones beneath their feet. They think themselves enlightened, but the darkness closes in.  They see not the shadows lengthening, the whispers in the wind.\n\nThey speak of a return, a yearning for something lost.  A flicker of a flame in the heart, a longing for the bedrock of things.  A time when the man's voice shook the earth, when his words were fire and his touch was grace.\n\nYears will turn to dust, centuries to ash. But the memory will linger.  It will rise up like a ghost, a chill in the marrow, a whisper in the night. They will seek him, the man, the source, the wellspring. They will strip away the layers, the accretions, the bones of dogma and reach for the flesh, the blood, the word.\n\nAnd when they find it, when they taste the salt of truth on their tongues, the world will change. Not in a blaze of fire, not with trumpets and armies. But in a slow, creeping thaw, a softening of the heart, a loosening of the hold.  They will remember.  They will be whole.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, it will stand.  A pillar in the storm, a beacon in the night.  But its face will be changed.  For the clock, it will turn backward.

A tomb built on the backs of men, women, and children, each cog in a machine that ground them down,  leaving behind only dust and despair.  The river itself, once a source of life, was now a choked artery of filth, thick with the refuse of their greed. The air hung heavy, a miasma of rot and despair. \n\nThese men, these lords of industry, they were wolves in fine suits, their hearts black as the coal that fueled their furnaces. They saw the workers not as men, but as cattle, to be driven and prodded,  their lives expendable in the pursuit of wealth. A dollar here, a penny there, the sum of their concern. They saw no humanity in the cracked hands, the hollow eyes, the coughs that choked the life from their lungs. \n\nThey built their empires on the backs of the broken, the forgotten, the desperate.  They knew their workers were slaves, not in chains, but in chains of poverty and fear.  There was no escape, no safety net, no chance for redemption.  The system was rigged, designed to keep them down, to keep them docile, to keep them silent.\n\nSinclair saw it all, this festering wound upon the soul of the nation.

White and gray, they dance together, a mournful waltz. White, the color of a lie whispered sweet, the promise of a dream. Gray, the dust settling on that dream, the weight of time. And red, pink, they bleed into each other, a fever dream, the flush of passion, and the stain of blood.\n\nFitzgerald, he builds these meanings slow, brick by brick, word by word.  He paints a picture with them, and you see it clear as day. Daisy, she's wrapped in white, always in white. A porcelain doll, beautiful, but cold.  Her world, it's all white, the parties, the clothes, the faces.  It's the world of the rich, the privileged, the ones who don't know the taste of ash.  And then there's the gray. The gray of the valley, the gray of the forgotten, the gray of a life lived in the shadow of something brighter. It's the color of Gatsby's dreams, fading, turning to ash.\n\nHe paints them together, these colors, and you see the truth. The emptiness of the white, the hollowness of the gray. He makes you feel it, the ache in your chest, the longing for something more. Fitzgerald, he's a master.\n\nHe paints a picture, not with a brush, but with words. And you see the world through his eyes.",

A place of plenty, choked with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens spilling over the hills like spilled secrets. But the air held a weight, a yolk of something stale and forgotten. The sun, it never really quit beating down, a hammer on the land, forging a life of sweat and toil.\n\nThey spoke of organic farms, these pockets of green in the dusty expanse. They were like whispers in the wind, promises of a better way. A way to coax life from the earth without poisoning it, a way to fill the bellies of men and the souls of birds. \n\nThey said there were waiting lists for this bounty, a hunger for the clean taste of a world untouched by man’s greed.  Eggs and milk, the color of dawn, pure and untouched.  They offered tours, glimpses into a world where the earth was not a conquered beast but a partner, a companion.\n\nBut the whispers, they weren't always kind.  They spoke of harder labor, of battles fought against weeds and pests with only sweat and song. Of losses, the sting of failure in a land that demanded its due. The scales tipped, they said, favoring the large, the loud, the ones who drowned the earth in chemicals and reaped the harvest in bitter silence.\n\nStill, they clung to the hope. A hope that the land itself could be healed, that the symphony of life could be restored. They sought refuge in the shadows of government programs, a lifeline tossed out to those who dared to dream of a different future. They spoke of biodiversity, of a patchwork quilt of life woven into the fabric of the earth.  Trees reaching for the sky, birdsong filling the air, a world where man and nature danced in a fragile, beautiful balance.\n\nThe land, it held its secrets close. A parcel of 160 acres, a tapestry of chaparral and oak woodland, whispering tales of indigenous spirits and weathered cattle trails. The ghosts of homesteaders, their names etched in the bones of the earth, lingered still.\n\nThey chose this land, a sliver of hope in a world teetering on the brink.

Culture's a ghost story told a thousand times, each telling a little different, a little darker. \n\nWhen you sit across from a stranger, his face a map of truths and lies, you see your own face staring back. Maybe that's why the world's so hard, why the heart cracks open at the sight of a familiar scar.\n\nBut you can't judge a man by the dust on his coat or the way he holds his pipe. You gotta listen to the silence between the words, the way his eyes track the shadows. See the ghosts in the corners of his mind.\n\nThere's a hunger in the air, a gnawing need to understand. But the truth is, you can't fully grasp another man's soul, no matter how hard you try. You're just two travelers on a road that leads nowhere, each carrying the weight of your own stories. \n\nAnd in the end, the only currency that matters is trust. A fragile thing, like a flame in the wind.\n\nThat's the thing about culture, about people. It's a dance in the dark. You take a step, they take a step, and sometimes you stumble, sometimes you fall.

            "The fool’s tongue, it whispers, “There is no God.”  The words crawl from Psalm 14, the same words that coil around Anselm’s argument, a serpent seeking purchase in the heart of belief. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same phantom, the God of the Bible, the God of fire and brimstone, the God of whispered promises. To compare them, we must accept this God, this entity, as the bedrock upon which they build their case.  To stray from this path would be to wander into a wilderness of gods, a chaos of shadows.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the confines of the mind.  He says that God exists because we know him, because to conceive of his absence is to stumble against the very fabric of understanding.  It's a truth born of contemplation, a light flickering within the skull. But is this truth enough? Can the mind, this fragile cage of bone and sinew, truly hold the weight of divinity?\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path. His God is a God of reason, a God who can be apprehended through the logic of the world, through the patterns of creation.  He lays out five arguments, five pillars of proof. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony.  Each one a brick laid in a wall, a wall designed to contain the divine within the bounds of human comprehension.\n\nBut are these arguments truly convincing? Does logic alone suffice to build a bridge to the infinite? Or do they, like Anselm’s faith, remain tethered to the limitations of the human mind?\n\nBoth men, they seek to prove the existence of God, but their methods diverge. One looks inward, the other outward.  And yet, neither truly offers a holistic understanding, a complete map of the divine.  Perhaps the truth, it lies somewhere beyond their reach, veiled in mystery, waiting to be discovered by a mind yet to be born.",

He walked away from the world, they say, found some kind of peace in the shadows and the quiet. His words took root and spread, bloomed into a religion. Buddhism they called it. The Theravada kind being the purest, they say.  Old as time, twenty-five hundred years or more. But the world shifts. The things that held meaning then, they don't hold the same weight now. Look at Sri Lanka, where they cut the water still. Monks and men, all joining hands in a ritual. Some kind of ceremony. But Buddha, they say, never spoke of such things. The changes in the faith, they run deep. From the surface whispers to the heart of the matter.\n\nThe monks, the layfolk, they've had to adjust. Turn the scriptures, reshape the meaning. Forces from the inside and the outside, both good and bad, they've been at play.\n\nThere are words we'll be using a lot, see. Inside and outside. Inside means the ones who follow the Buddhasasana, monks and layfolk alike. Outside means anything that comes from those who don't.  And then there's the good and the bad. The bad ones, they want to hurt the faith, see. Their words are like thorns, aimed at the heart of the Buddha's teachings. The good ones, they don't mean to help or harm. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's just the way things are.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the heart of it all. The core beliefs of Theravada Buddhism. They find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, that's the teachings, the Tripitaka, the three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka, that's the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, especially for the monks. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that's the deeper stuff, the metaphysics.  No soul, they say. Suffering is all there is. Everything changes. Only by seeing this can you escape the cycle of birth and death, the Sansara.  And along with it, desire, hatred, delusion, they all fade away. Enlightenment comes.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, it lays down the rules. Five precepts for the layfolk: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't lust, don't get drunk. The monks, they have many more rules to follow. The most important thing, though, is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, suffering comes from clinging. Third, suffering can be overcome. Fourth, the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The sun bled through the haze, a pale ghost of its former self, casting long shadows on the dusty plains. It hung low in the sky, the same sky that had witnessed the slow burn of a rivalry, a feud as old as the land itself.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of animosity that stretched back over half a century, from the year 1836 to the cusp of a new century in 1893.  A war, the Mexican-American War, scarred the land, a wound that festered for years. Texas, the Southwest, these territories bled away from Mexico, claimed by the United States in a bloody conflict.\n\nThe clash wasn't just over land, though. It was a clash of worlds, of cultures and beliefs, a storm of different gods and devils raging in the hearts of men. Religion, tradition, a hunger for something more, these things drove the nations apart, fueled the fires of resentment. They circled each other, wary beasts, always ready to strike.\n\nThis wasn't unique, this rivalry.  Borders, those lines drawn in the sand, often breed conflict. Nations, like wolves in the night, eyeing each other's territory, their needs and desires a tangled web of greed and fear.  The United States, a wolf with a hunger for expansion, found itself fixated on these southern neighbors, Mexico and Cuba, a constant thorn in its side.\n\nReligion, that ever-present force, cast a long shadow.  The Americans, wary of Catholicism, of monarchy, saw in Mexico a reflection of their own past, a history they sought to shed.  This wasn't unlike the Cold War, a battle not just of ideologies, but of souls.  The United States, like a child guarding its toys, feared the influence of Mexico, its ancient beliefs a threat to its own.\n\nThe land itself bore the scars of this conflict.  Border disputes, raids, whispers of violence - these were the echoes of a past that refused to die.  Outlaws, bandits, ghosts of history roamed the dusty plains, their footsteps a reminder of the fragility of peace.\n\nFor a time, the United States, the bigger, stronger wolf, triumphed.  Mexico, forced to bow to its will, became dependent, a shadow of its former self.  But the hunger of power never truly sates.  The United States, its gaze shifting, now sought not land, but control, manipulating the economy, the strings of power.\n\nThe rivalry, a slow burn over decades, finally flickered and died.  But the ghosts of the past lingered, a reminder that peace is a delicate dance, a fragile thing, easily shattered by the winds of change.",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came upon me sudden, unexpected. A thing I’d never known. Nurse I was then, tending to others. Chosen it for the kind of peace it promised. A life of steady work, a life where sickness would always be, always need tending. A mantra, whispered from childhood: *You'll always find work, people will always get sick.*  My own dreams, they'd lain fallow – science, perhaps, or words put to paper, a blend of both.  But nursing, that was the safe choice. \n\nYet here I was. Forty-six years walked, single, pockets as bare as a winter wind. The sickness, it took hold, a thief in the night. Fifteen years on,  the world spins on, but I’m caught in the undertow. Social Security, a thin thread, that’s all that keeps me afloat. Nothing left to call my own, not a single thing. Every day a struggle, a gnawing at the edges of security, safety, and the thin veil of self-respect. The world’s a shaky thing, uncertain. But one truth shines clear: Without the hand of family, the kindness of friends, I’d be swallowed whole. In the face of real disaster, you discover just how fragile the human spirit can be.\n\nLife, it throws curveballs. Big ones, small ones, they keep coming. No matter how hard you plan, some things are too vast to face alone.\n\nWe talk, these days, about pulling back from the big government, righting the ship before it sinks. And maybe that’s right. But I’d rather see folks learn to trust again, to offer a hand, to ask for help when the world turns cold. We’re not meant to be islands, adrift in a sea of fear.\n\nThe talk is of rugged individualism, the backbone of this nation.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn’t do it by grit alone. They did it with compassion, with respect, with the shared burden of survival. \n\nSo, yes, be ready. I am. I have my supplies – bandages, water tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods. If you have the land, the means, grow your own food, can it, preserve it. A wood stove, a good idea if you’re not stuck in an apartment.\n\nBut while you’re at it, get to know your neighbors.  Build a bridge, not a wall.",
            "The shape a thing takes, why it takes that shape, a question as old as the rocks themselves.  Even now, we barely grasp how to speak of it, how to measure in numbers the slow, creeping dance of change over time. Thompson, he saw it, back in '17, the need for a language beyond words, a way to map the very marrow of creation.  \n\nWe're trying to find that language, to understand how a shell, a spiraled curve of bone, comes to be.  These Prumnu shells, they tell a story, a story in whorl and suture, in the slow widening of the spiral.  We use the eye, but also the eye of the machine,  CerioShell, a program that can spin the numbers, conjure forms, show us the echoes of what might have been, what could yet be.\n\nA shell, it's a journey through time. A tube that winds, a spiral that stretches across space, through 360 degrees. Each turn, a whorl, and the path it takes, the speed it gathers, that's the story written in bone.\n\nImagine the aperture, the mouth of the shell, a point that moves, a traveler tracing its path through time. We can map its journey, its coordinates, the radius of its path. And from those coordinates, we can see the direction of the journey, the constraints that shape it.\n\nThere's a language in the whorls, in the sutures, a language we're just beginning to learn.  It's a language of limits, of possibilities, of the slow, relentless march of change.",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. In Indonesia, the children died.  Not in the quick, sudden violence of storm or flood, but in the slow, suffocating grip of neglect.  For a decade, the numbers had held, a grim plateau against the rising tide of progress that swept through the other facets of life.  Millennium promises, those grand pronouncements of a better world, they were met with a hollow echo.  Water flowed, sanitation improved, yet the children still withered,  their small lives extinguished before they could truly begin.\n\nThey told you of skilled attendants at birth, 72% they claimed, a figure that danced on the edge of meaning.  Midwives, women steeped in the ancient lore of the womb, they counted too.  But what use was lore against the hemorrhage that stole mothers, the fever that choked the newborn?\n\nAnd the diarrhea, a relentless scourge that ravaged the littlest ones.  Fewer sought treatment now, the numbers whispered, a silent retreat from the shadow of illness.\n\nEven the caesarean section, a blade held against the flesh, remained a distant hope.  Only 4% of births received this intervention, a stark reminder of the chasm that yawned between the urban sprawl and the forgotten villages.\n\nThe rich, they had their access, their hospitals glittering under the sun.  But for the poor, the journey was a gamble, the cost a silent killer.  A 27% gap, a canyon of despair separating the haves from the have-nots.\n\nSo what was to be done?  Programmatic solutions, they called them, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But each bandaged wound, a testament to the failure of the whole.  To pour resources into one narrow channel, was to starve the rest.  A grand house built on a single pillar, destined to crumble. \n\nThe answer, it seemed, lay not in quick fixes but in the slow, painstaking work of building a true system, a web of care that reached every corner, every soul.  A system where the whisper of the child's cry was heard, not in the sterile halls of the rich, but in the heart of the village, in the warmth of the mother's embrace.",
            "The dust of vanished worlds clung to the cobblestones, whispering tales of a time when gaslights flickered and carriages clattered, a time before the endless ash choked the air and the sun bled gray. Victorian novels, those monuments to detail and the gilded cages of the aristocracy, held little sway in this bleached landscape. Yet, even in this desolation, echoes of that era linger, twisting in the shadows like phantoms. Two tales, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" rise from the ruins, their mysteries deepened by a touch of the grotesque, a shimmer of the uncanny. They dare to delve into the hearts of their characters, not through the polite pronouncements of drawing-room dialogues, but through a darkness that reflects the soul's own hidden abyss.\n\nThe streets of London, slick with rain and reeking of decay, bleed into Oliver's dreams. His mind, a fractured mirror reflecting the fractured world around him, becomes a stage for fragmented memories and haunting presences.  \n\n> *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese fragmented visions are not mere phantoms of the night; they are the ragged edges of Oliver's shattered reality. Sikes and Crackit, the embodiment of brutality and greed, stalk him even in his dreams, their voices echoing the threat that hangs over him. The gunshot, a jarring punctuation mark in his fractured world, rings out not as a singular event but as a constant torment, a reminder of his vulnerability and the indifference of the world he inhabits. His escape feels less like liberation and more like a descent into a deeper, more insidious darkness. \n\nOn the windswept moors of \"Wuthering Heights,\" shadows dance with a different kind of menace. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, leaving the characters trapped in a cycle of obsession and revenge. The novel's gothic atmosphere, its desolate landscapes and brooding characters,  becomes a crucible where the human heart is twisted and consumed.\n\n\nThe mysteries that shroud both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" are not mere literary devices. They are windows into the darker recesses of the human soul, reflecting the anxieties and terrors that lurk beneath the surface of Victorian society. In a world where appearances can be deceiving and the veneer of civilization is thin, these novels force us to confront the raw, unvarnished truth: that beneath the surface of order and decorum, chaos and madness reign.",
            "The boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, he was a puzzle.  Didn't read right. Some letters, no problem, others…like they were written in a tongue he’d never heard.  Latino, that was for sure, but his English was clean, no accent, no stammer.  He struggled, a plaintive thing, and I wrestled with him over sentences, over sounds, over words that wouldn’t come. It was a back road to nowhere.  \n\nThen his mother came. A quiet woman, Spanish her only song. I knew just a few words, enough to hold a line, a thread.  But when she spoke, her hands tracing her son’s face, understanding bloomed, slow and heavy.  Adrian, he could read, just not the letters. Not the alphabet.  It was a key missing, a lock without teeth.  \n\nThat day, the weight lifted a mite. Not a cure, just a glimpse of the truth.  I don't know if it helped him much.  Hope he’s alright.\n\nThat boy, he's a ghost now, a whisper in the dust.  But he brought a truth to the surface, one that  grabs you by the collar out here in California.  The language barrier, it's a wall, invisible, yet solid.  You think you see a child, you see the struggle, but sometimes the truth hides behind a veil.\n\nIt ain't always obvious.  A kid speaks perfect English, but the letters, they're strangers.  A reading problem, but one born of a different tongue. \n\nAdrian, he was a start, a crack in the wall.   But the whole thing, it's a damn puzzle, a house of cards with too many pieces.  Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL – they’re all tools, but no one tool can fix it. It takes a hand, a mind, a heart. It takes all of us.",
            "The rain came down hard on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the night. We sat on the porch, the air thick with smoke and the smell of wet earth. He was thinner now, my father, his clothes hanging like shrouds. His eyes, though, they still held that same distant light, the kind that looked past the here and now, into some faraway shore.  I asked him about his favorite bird, the way you do when words fail and silence stretches too long. \"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice a rasp.  He watched the water run off the eaves, the gutters overflowing like black rivers into the thirsty earth.\n\nWe'd been told, all of us, that there was something beyond. Something vast and unknowable, waiting out there in the dark.  Some found solace in temples and churches, others in the quiet roar of their own souls. But me, I'd always been drawn to the silence, the emptiness. I sought answers in the rustle of leaves, the whisper of wind through the trees.  \n\nMy father, he never spoke much about it.  Religion, faith, the big questions – they were like ghosts in our house, always present, but never named.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. Five days after the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. The chemo, the radiation, they just slowed the inevitable.  I didn't want to watch him fade. Didn't want to see the light leave his eyes. So I didn't. I couldn't.\n\nI remember him better this way, in the sunlight, laughing, sharing stories.  Not in the sterile white of a hospital room, his body wracked with pain.\n\nNo one called me when he died. \n\nMaybe they knew. Maybe they knew that I already had him in my heart, a shadow cast by the sun, a memory etched in the bark of a tree.",
            "The Gothic, a word clinging to the husk of its own meaning, an oxymoron twisted from \"Old-New,\" as that Watt fellow put it. Disparaged, praised, accused of emptiness, lauded for a terror that felt somehow grand.  Like a ship caught in a storm, tossed between the shore of the familiar and the edge of the unknown. Walpole, he saw it first, this shape taking form in the dark.  His *Castle of Otranto*, a ghost story spun from threads of the ancient and the modern.  He took the theatrics of the old, the shadows and whispers of forgotten playhouses, and wove them into the new cloth of the novel. A tapestry where the reader, a voyeur in the mind of the story, could see the soul laid bare.  \n\nThe word \"Gothic\" itself, a stain on the canvas of time, had been applied to everything from people to places, a descriptor for the archaic and the crude, a shadow cast upon the bright face of the modern world.  But in this collision, this marriage of the theatrical and the introspective, the Gothic found its foothold. It became a mirror, reflecting both the past and the present, a space where what was lost could be mourned and what was feared could be faced.\n\nAnd within this mirror, the figure of Chivalry rose.  Not the chivalrous knight of old, polished and pristine, but a ghost, a memory, a longing for a better world.  For Walpole, writing in a time of turmoil, the world seemed to be veering off course, the compass broken. He saw the knight, the embodiment of honor and courage, as a forgotten ideal, a beacon in the gathering darkness.  And in his novel, he painted Frederic, a prince, a warrior, a victim, as a flickering flame of that lost ideal.\n\nFrederic, described in words that echo with the cadence of bygone ages, is a figure draped in tragedy, a knight fallen from grace.  His story, a lament for a world that has lost its way.  He is the armor, rusted and worn, the sword dulled but still dangerous.  He is the last echo of a song long forgotten.",
            "The world turns on the back of a mule. Goods and men, both alike, shuffled along the worn tracks of need. From the first whisper of a want to the final sigh of a customer's hand on a purchased prize. A chain it is, forged from the cold steel of necessity. A chain forged back in eighty-two by a man named Oliver, a man who understood the rhythm of want and the song of the market. He spoke of planning, of planting seeds in the dark soil of production and watching them bloom into the fields of supply.  \n\nThere are six stones in this chain, each a facet of the whole. Production, the heart beating in the chest of the system. Supply, the lifeblood coursing through its veins. Inventory, the watchful eyes that measure and guard. Location, the bones that give it shape and form. Transportation, the wind that carries it forward. And information, the whispers that guide its path. \n\nProduction, they say, is where it all begins. It's the forge where raw materials are hammered into shape, where the will of the market is translated into tangible goods. Managers, they stand watch over this process, their minds sharp as scalpels, dissecting the wants and needs of the world. They study the market, a living beast with shifting appetites, and they learn its language. They know what it craves, what it desires, and they build their offerings accordingly.  \n\nThen comes supply, the art of choosing the right partners, the right tools, the right hands to bring the vision to life.  Outsourcing, they call it, a dance between collaboration and competition. To outsource is to choose speed, flexibility, and the promise of lower costs.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, its message a rasping whisper on the street corner. \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, face pale beneath the unforgiving glare of the streetlamps, held it aloft, the Sharpie scrawl stark against the cardboard. Burma. Myanmar. A land choked by a junta's iron fist, a place where the weight of history pressed down like a shroud. \n\nIt was 2007. Monks, saffron robes burning bright against the gray of the dawn, had risen. They walked, chanting, a tide of gold against the khaki. The Saffron Revolution.  A flicker of hope in the suffocating darkness. But the junta, a serpent coiled around the nation's throat, struck back.  \n\nMonasteries became battlegrounds. The air filled with the crack of gunfire, the wail of sirens, the cries of the dying. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were met with imprisonment, with death. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, bled out on the asphalt, his camera still clutched in his hand. \n\nThe official count was a whisper, a lie. Colonel Hla Win, his voice a broken echo from the heart of the storm, spoke of thousands swallowed by the dust, their names lost to the wind. \n\nThis wasn't new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was as old as the world itself.  Roman emperors, gods in their own right, ruled with an iron fist. Japanese emperors, their lineage woven into the fabric of the heavens, claimed dominion over the very souls of their people. And here, in the heart of America, the whispers spoke of a president, a man who sought communion with the darkness, who plotted with the shadows. \n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of humanity, demanding freedom, met with a storm of steel. The Red Cross whispered of thousands, the government of a few hundred. Their words, like the blood on the pavement, faded into the silence.\n\nRwanda, a decade later. Hutu against Tutsi, a genocide painted in blood. The Butcher of Kigali, a name whispered with fear, orchestrated a symphony of death.\n\nAnd then, the shadow of the Third Reich, a darkness that stretched across the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity. \n\nHitler. Alive in Burma? The sign creaked, a mournful echo in the empty street. Was it a truth too terrible to bear? Or a lie whispered to keep the world watching, afraid?",
            "The man came to see it like this: Duke Ellington’s ghost lived in the music. Not in the piano notes, not much, but in the space between. The space where a man named Bubber Miley could blow a muted trumpet and it sounded like a voice crying out, and where a girl named Baby Cox could scat and it sounded like rain on a tin roof. It was the space where Ellington, his heart and bones, had shaped the sound of the band, made it his own.\n\nHe’d taken those raw notes, those souls set to play, and he’d wove them into something new. A tapestry of sound, each thread a voice, a horn, a beat, all singing together. It wasn’t just the melodies, though those were fine enough. It was the spaces between the notes, the silences, the whispers that made it breathe.  \n\nLike in “Creole Love Call,” that song was a slow burn, a love letter in twelve bars.  The first chorus, the voice and the reeds, a conversation, soft and then rough, like a memory coming back. The trumpet, muted, it wept blues, each note drawn out, dripping with sorrow. The clarinet, it soared high, a lonely bird in the sky. And then the whole band, a chorus of voices, echoing the cry.\n\nAnd then, the last chorus, the voice, it growled, like a beast waking. It wasn’t singing anymore, it was playing, an instrument of the soul.  And then a trombone, a final note, a shiver, a ghost in the wind.\n\nEllington, he knew how to make a sound, how to make it sing. Like in “Hot and Bothered,” the trumpet and the scat, they danced, they argued, they laughed. A conversation in a foreign tongue, understood only by the ears. And in “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” that trombone, it spoke the melody, a low rumble, a promise.\n\nHe’d crafted a world of sound, and in it, he’d made a home.",
            "The ache had been with her, a gnawing emptiness, since she was fourteen. A yearning for something nameless, something unclaimed.  A thirst not quenched by things, but by the touch of another soul.  Boys hadn't interested her, their clumsy advances like moths drawn to a light they couldn't understand. She’d studied herself, dissected her own heart, seeking the reason for this strange, quiet longing. Theories formed and dissipated like smoke in the wind, leaving her with only the echo of the question: why?\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a calm woven from the threads of her parents' gentle natures. Arguments were rare, like storms passing over a still lake. Her own spirit, however, was a restless flame, a wildfire of energy that danced at odds with their placidity. Yet, they loved her, embraced her wildness as a part of their own, a counterpoint to their harmony.\n\nBut today, the peace was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice, thin and strained, sliced through the air. It came from the kitchen, a sharp note of pain.  Panic gripped her.  \"Mom? Mom, what is it?\" she cried, her words tumbling over themselves as she rushed into the room. \n\nThere she was, her mother, fallen on the floor, her face contorted in agony. \"Ow...sweet...hospital...\" her words were fragmented, each one a shard of glass. Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of helplessness washing over her. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice firm despite the tremor in her heart, \"Just tell me where to take you.\"  \n\nHer mother, her hand trembling, pointed towards the car.  And in that moment, the strength she had cultivated in her own body, honed through years of disciplined practice, surged to the forefront. She lifted her mother, her own muscles straining against the weight, and carried her to the car.  She deposited her gently in the backseat and drove, the world a blur of motion and worry.\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but those weren't the scents that dominated her senses.  It was the raw, sickening fear for her mother that filled her lungs, a suffocating tide. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea in the echoing halls.  Doctors and nurses converged, their faces etched with concern.  \n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf. A simple misstep, an accident, but for now it felt like a betrayal, a violation of the sanctity of their peaceful home.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the study. A whisper on the wind told of the Mediterranean Diet, a way of life built on sun-bleached stones and olive groves.  They called it the aMed diet, a reckoning of the choices laid bare on a plate: more of the earth's bounty – the fruits, the nuts, the grains, the legumes – and less of the animal's flesh, less of the fat that choked the veins.  They measured its worth against the specter of heart disease, seeking a haven in the shadow of a stroke.\n\nOld tales spoke of a light in the belly of the Mediterranean, a glow against the encroaching darkness of sickness.  They'd followed the path of olive oil, a slick trail across the years, and seen a flicker in the lives of those who walked it.  But this time, the whispers focused on the storm – the stroke, the sudden shattering of the vessel.\n\nThey gathered the women, seventy-four thousand strong, their lives unfolding like maps across the land. They were daughters of the earth, nurses tending to a nation's wounds.  From the year 1984 to 2004, six times they held out their hands, offering up their memories of meals past. Each bite, a brushstroke on a canvas of health, recorded in the faded ink of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nAnd they watched, these women, their gazes fixed on the horizon of their own mortality.  The years marched on, relentless as the tide.  Some fell, struck down by the shadow of heart disease, others by the relentless hand of stroke. The stories of their lives, etched in hospital records and death certificates, served as the testament.  \n\nThe women in the highest ranks of the aMed diet, their plates brimming with the earth's bounty, stood tall against the storm.  Their risk, a whisper in the wind, compared to those who had strayed from the path.  The aMed diet, a shield against the darkness, a testament to the enduring strength of the earth's embrace.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, it choked. A sickness spread through the veins of the American economy. Banks, fat and bloated, lay sick with bad blood, their arteries clogged with promises they couldn't keep. The houses, them towers of folly, began to crumble, their foundations built on sand and deceit. Men in suits, eyes glazed with greed, had gambled with the nation's wealth, playing fast and loose with the lives of ordinary folk. \n\nThey called it a crisis. A recession. But it was more than that. It was the death rattle of a dream, the slow, grinding halt of a machine built on lies.  It began in the shadows, in the backrooms of Washington, where the whispers of deregulation slithered through the halls of power. Clinton, he'd chased re-election like a hound on a scent, his nose pressed to the ground, sniffing out the sweet aroma of popularity. He loosened the reins, let the banks run wild, fueled by the cheap blood of sub-prime loans.\n\nAnd the vultures, they circled. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these paper tigers, they devoured the bad meat, packaging it into CDOs and CDSs, a toxic stew of debt that would poison the whole nation. The banks, drunk on their own hubris, piled on, chasing profits with reckless abandon.\n\nThe houses, they rose like monuments to folly, ticking time bombs on the landscape. Adjustable rates, they were called, a seductive promise of cheap dreams made flesh. But the music stopped, and the piper came calling. The payments, they couldn't be met. The houses, they fell. And the blood began to flow.\n\nThe market, it crashed. The banks, they choked. The economy, it shuddered and died. Five trillion dollars, it vanished like smoke in the wind. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, names that once whispered of power, now reduced to dust. \n\nAnd the people, they paid the price. Jobs lost, homes foreclosed, dreams shattered. A generation scarred, forever marked by the stench of failure.\n\nWe stand now, in the ashes of their folly. The question isn't how did it happen? But what will we do about it? Will we learn from the mistakes of the past? Or will we stumble blindly into another abyss, repeating the same sins again and again?",

The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and decay, a graveyard aroma that clung to everything.  He stood on the cracked asphalt, the wind tearing at his threadbare coat.  He thought of the man, the night manager, the man with the tired eyes and the haunted look.  A man who once wore a uniform, a man who traded the roar of engines for the hum of fluorescent lights.  He imagined the man's hands, calloused from years of gripping a fishing rod, now clutching a tired, worn-out rag as he wiped down the counter, the ghosts of breakfast plates and greasy coffee cups still lingering in the air.  He pictured the man's face, etched with the lines of a life lived under a harsh sun, now shadowed by a past he couldn't escape.\n\nHe'd met him once, years ago, a fleeting glimpse in a barroom, a shared glance over a glass of whiskey.  A man who'd seen too much, who carried the weight of untold stories in his eyes.  He'd heard whispers of him, rumors of a past life, of a wife and child lost to the dust and the wind.  He'd heard of the gas station, a lonely outpost on the edge of oblivion, where dreams went to die and memories clung to the air like smoke.\n\nHe turned away, his gaze drawn to the horizon, where the sun bled into the dust-filled sky.  The wind whispered through the empty windows of the gas station, a mournful echo of a life half-lived.  The man was gone, swallowed by the desert, a forgotten soul in a forgotten place.  And here he stood, a stranger in a strange land, searching for a story, a connection, a spark of hope in the vast emptiness.",
            "The television hummed, a pallid light flickering across the worn face of the man in the worn chair. Two stories from Columbus. The first, a man named Hostettler, eyes like a pit in the dark, had taken his wife in Ashley. Multiple times, they said, the blade flashing. Two minutes, that's all it took. A fleck of dust in the vast machine. The second, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, found shattered in the woods. No names, no faces, only the echo of a gunshot. SWAT combing the shadows, searching for a whisper in the wind. The  night had swallowed him whole.\n\nThen the Med-Flight, a hole punched clean through its belly by a .22. Five thousand dollars for the truth, they promised. But the truth held its tongue, silent in the dark. The rain was coming, they said, a hot, heavy blanket falling on the city. They spoke of temperatures, of the weekend stretching before, a blank canvas.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF. A black man, they said, hoodie pulled low. Six foot tall, a shadow in the night. They lingered on the color, on the details of his darkness.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a kingpin they called him, drugs flowing from Texas like a poisoned river.  Not twenty-five years, no, three hundred months. The number hung in the air, a harsh and hollow clang. A Hispanic, they added, a footnote in the story.\n\nThe screen went dark. Only the hum remained, a low, keening sound. The man in the chair stared at the blankness, a hollow space mirroring the emptiness within.",
            "The blood ties. They run deep. A river black and cold with the mud of forgotten things. Love, hate, envy, the raw knot of them all tangled up inside. Brothers. They see themselves in one another's eyes, clear as the bones beneath the skin. It's in the bad times, the bone-deep dark, that the truth of it shines through. A fire that burns with a pale, gray light.\n\nThere's a cost to this knowledge. A price paid in blood and silence. You look into your brother's eyes and you see not the man the world sees, but the man he truly is. The man he hides from himself. The man he wants to be. And in the wreckage of his actions, you see your own reflection.\n\nDown in the swamps, two brothers walk a path choked with Spanish moss. A path worn smooth by the weight of their unspoken words. One brother, strong, his heart a drumbeat in his chest. The other, frail, his spirit a whisper on the wind. \n\nThey walk towards a storm.\n\nPride, a hard stone in the elder brother's chest. He wants to shape his brother, mold him into the image he himself craves. But the younger brother, he is porcelain, easily broken.\n\nThe landscape, it bleeds with this tension. A symphony of green and decay. The air thick with the smell of rain and death.\n\nAnd in the end, only one will survive.\n\nThe final scene, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow and regret. A brother, broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of his own ambition. The other, left standing, a hollow shell, his victory a bitter taste on his tongue.",
            "The mind, it's a dark and tangled thing. Not a machine, though they try to make it so. A box, a book, a goddamn computer – ain't none of it true. It's more like a well, a fathomless well of echoes. Takes in the raw whispers of the world – touch, sound, light – and twists them into something else. Something new. Something…imagined. \n\nSee, the world ain't just what you see. You see a box, black on white, sure. But the mind, it's already building a story around it. A box with what inside? A door? A secret? A whisper of fear? It's a dance, this seeing, a constant back-and-forth between what is and what could be.\n\nAnd then there's the filter. The curtain that falls, choosing what to let through, what to hold back. It's a cruel gatekeeper, letting in the blade of grass you step on, but shutting out the whispers of a thousand unseen things.\n\nBut it's a lonely thing, this well. Memory, it's the only company it has.  A storehouse of ghosts, of things seen and heard and felt. Some fleeting, some clinging on, whispering in the dark.\n\nAnd how it's all organized, that's the real mystery. A tangled web, a map without a guide. Some say it's all connected, a web of meaning spun from the threads of experience. Others say it's shattered, a mosaic of fragments, each one a piece of the whole, but broken beyond repair.\n\nWhatever it is, it's a wonder. A terrifying, beautiful, and ultimately unknowable thing. The mind, it's the last frontier. A wilderness we're only just beginning to explore.",
            "The words of Huxley, a man who saw the shadows lengthening, who felt the chill of a future unblinking in its glass and steel embrace. He laid bare the coming darkness in Brave New World, a vision of a world consumed by its own creation. A world where community choked the individual, where happiness was a manufactured drug, dispensed in measured doses by the World Controller, a puppet master pulling the strings of a society lulled into a synthetic stupor.\n\nHe speaks of technology, a serpent slithering through the veins of humanity, promised as salvation but bearing the venom of its own undoing.  He speaks of capitalism, a machine grinding down the human spirit, its gears oiled by the insatiable hunger for more, for consumption, for the illusion of fulfillment.\n\nMarxism, that ancient scripture of the downtrodden, whispers through the pages of Huxley's work.  Homogeny, the crushing weight of sameness, smothers the soul. Reification, the cold objectification of human beings into mere cogs in the machine, stares back from the vacant eyes of the World State's citizens. \n\nFalse consciousness, that insidious veil woven over the eyes of the masses, blinds them to the true nature of their servitude.  The proletariat, trapped in a web of manufactured desires, their yearning for true connection replaced by the hollow comfort of fleeting pleasures. \n\nHegemony, the iron fist of the ruling class, clenches around the throat of the world, silencing dissent and crushing any flicker of rebellion. The lower castes, the Deltas, Gammas, Epsilons, are mere cattle, herded and controlled, their minds dulled by the endless hum of consumerism.\n\nAnd what of love? What of the burning intensity of human connection?  In this sterile world, it is a forgotten language, a whisper lost in the din of the manufactured masses.  Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth, a hollow echo of the real thing.\n\nHuxley's vision is a bleak one, a warning whispered across the chasm of time. A reminder that the pursuit of progress, untethered from the embrace of humanity, can lead only to a cold and desolate wasteland.",
            "The road to knowledge, they say, is paved with time. But here, on this campus, the road is more like a dust trail, thin and winding, stretching out under a sky ate up by steel and glass. Two and a half years I've walked these paths, measured them in the relentless tick of each clock in each building. East Halls they called it, my first home, a godforsaken outpost, a world away from the heart of things. Willard, they said, a name like a whisper from the past, a place of learning, a place of dust motes dancing in the sunbeams. But to reach it, it felt like crossing a wasteland.\n\nThey built up this place, brick by brick, hope by hope, a monument to progress. The fields, the empty fields, they used to whisper of something else. Something wilder. Now they're choked with concrete and steel, monuments to the ever-growing hunger of this place.\n\nThe answer, they say, is simple: a bicycle. A machine of two wheels and steel, a promise of speed and freedom. But the bicycle is a tool, a weapon in the hands of a warrior. It needs a landscape built for it, a world where the wind whispers through the spokes and the road unfolds like a ribbon under its tires.\n\nMy friend, he came back to it, to the bicycle, after years lost in the shadows of the everyday. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his words rasping like dry leaves.\n\nAnd he's right. My own legs have learned the rhythm of the wheels, the cadence of the pavement. Twenty-five minutes, they say, to walk to Thomas building. But the bicycle, it whispers a different truth. Five minutes, a blur of metal and movement, a rush of wind against my face.\n\nYet even the bicycle stumbles against the reality of this place. Pollock Road, a scar across the landscape, a reminder of the old world swallowed by the new. The wind bites, the rain stings, and the road itself seems to resist the passage of time.\n\nBut the bicycle, it is a defiance, a small act of rebellion against the slow crush of the everyday. It is a reminder that even in a world built for cars and concrete, there is still room for the simple act of motion, the whisper of wheels against pavement, the rhythm of the heart beating in time with the pedals."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer.

Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

He'd walk it for him, mile by mile, if it took a lifetime.  His education, a road paved with good intent, led him here, to this desolate place.  He'd heard the whispers, seen the shadows of neglect, the cracks in the foundation of families.  It was a sickness in the marrow of things, a slow rot that devoured innocence.  \n\nHe'd seen it in the eyes of that boy, the one who'd sought refuge in his friend's home, a sanctuary built on shaky ground.  The boy's silence spoke volumes, his fear a palpable thing in the stale summer air.  The parents, cloaked in their own justifications, blind to the damage they wrought. The boy needed a haven, a place where his voice could be heard, where the tremor in his hands wouldn't be dismissed as weakness. That's where he came in.  \n\nHe'd learned the language of brokenness, the code of the abandoned, the whispers of the unseen. His psychology degree, a shield against the darkness, had given him the tools, the understanding. But it was more than that. It was a fire, a burning need to mend the jagged edges of lives torn apart.\n\nHe believed in service, in the quiet dignity of respect, in the unwavering compass of ethical conduct.  These weren't just words, but the very bedrock of his being.  He'd learned from the ashes of his own past, the scars etched deep, the lessons forged in pain.\n\nSocial justice, a flickering flame in a world shrouded in darkness.  It was a fight, a battle against the tide of complacency, the apathy that masked the suffering of the voiceless.  He saw it in the faces of the forgotten, the marginalized, the ones who dared to be different.  He'd stood with them, his voice a defiant echo against the silence.  He'd fight for them, for the boy on the couch, for a world where every soul mattered. \n\nThis was his calling, his destiny.  He would walk the path, however long, however arduous, until the road to justice was paved with hope.",
            "The dark came down slow, a shroud over the land. This was a story of sleep, or the lack of it. A sickness of the mind, they called it, insomnia. Some said it was in the blood, a shadow passed down from father to son, a ghost in the genes. Others said it was the world that wore you down, the weight of it pressing on your chest, the endless grind of living. \n\nThey talked of models, of biology and society, of how the body and the world conspired to steal your rest. They spoke of neurons firing in the dark, of chemicals in the brain, of the hypothalamus, a silent conductor orchestrating the symphony of sleep. They studied mice, those pale shadows of men, and found a receptor, a keyhole in the brain where a drug could fit, a lock that, if broken, could unlock the door to slumber. \n\nBut what of the man who lay awake, staring at the ceiling, the dust motes dancing in the moonlight? What of the woman whose mind raced, a torrent of thoughts flooding her like a rising tide? The world wasn't just made of genes and chemicals. It was made of stories, of fear and hope, of love and loss. The world could crack a man's soul, steal his peace, and leave him hollow and empty.\n\nThey spoke of race, of poverty, of the burden of history, of how the world's injustices could wear a man down, keep him from finding solace in sleep. They spoke of the color of skin, the language spoken, the life lived, and how these things could shape a man's destiny, even in the darkness of sleeplessness.",
            "The whispering dark of the mind, that’s what this is. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they call it.  A snag in the way the world speaks, the way the sounds get sorted and understood. The ears hear, sure, but the message gets lost somewhere between the soundwaves and the meanings. A wilderness in the mind, where words scatter and confusion takes root. They call it CAPD, or APD, but it’s a name for a silence, a hollowness where meaning should be. \n\nThey’ve been picking at the edges of this silence for decades, these doctors and researchers. Back in the fifties, they called it “auditory imperception,” a faint echo in the halls of understanding. They started prodding and poking, trying to find the source of the deafness in the soul. Kimura, Bocca, Calearo, names whispered in hushed tones in the halls of science, trying to map the terrain of this hidden darkness.\n\nAnd the darkness shows itself in a thousand ways.  Lost in the echo chamber of the mind, a child might not know where a sound is coming from, or which voice is speaking. Words blend together, a river of sound with no banks, no shores.  A joke, a change in tone, a whisper of sarcasm – all lost in the wash. Some days, sound is a jumble, a dense fog that obscures meaning.\n\nFinding this silence, this deafness in the soul, it’s a slow, careful process.  A teacher watches a child struggle, observes the way they turn their head, the way their eyes search for the source of sound. They listen for the gaps, the moments when the child is lost in the maelstrom of sound.  Questionnaires, tests, a symphony of stimuli designed to break through the fog. \n\nBut there are no easy answers, no single test that unlocks the secrets of this silent world. The cause, shrouded in mystery, remains elusive. A whispered question in the darkness, unanswered.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it speaks of a truth, a dark truth. That a man may wear a mask, a skin of another, and walk in shadows for a time.  But the shadow, it can consume you. The longer you wear the mask, the harder it is to see the man beneath. You lose yourself in the lie, a ghost in your own life.  And when the mask is torn away, when the truth comes crashing down - well, there's a kind of death that comes with that. A death of the old self, the one you thought you were.\n\nDeception, it's a double-edged blade. It can save you, or it can destroy you.  And the deeper the deceit, the more dangerous it becomes.  To play at being another, to walk in stolen shoes - that's a perilous path. Viola, she knew this. She had to disguise herself, to become Cesario, to survive. But in doing so, she closed herself off from the world, from the sisters of her kind. \n\nAnd then, the more twisted the web becomes. Olivia, she falls for Cesario, for the phantom that Viola has become. A love born of illusion, a love built on a lie. And Orsino, he pines for Cesario, unaware of the woman who bleeds beneath the borrowed skin.  It's a dance of the damned, this play of shadows. They are all trapped, bound by a lie they cannot escape.\n\nThe play asks a question: can we ever truly know who another is, or are we always seeing a reflection in a distorted mirror? And can we ever forgive ourselves, or those we love, for the masks they wear? These are the questions that linger, long after the curtain falls.",
            "The dust hung heavy in the air, the color of bone.  German rule, they said.  Brutal. The Ovaherero, the Nama, gone.  Swallowed by the dust like ash in a dying fire. But a shadow can't be measured by the length of its darkness.  This empire, it stretched across continents, held together by iron and greed, a tapestry woven with threads of blood and sweat.  And within that tapestry, the threads of education ran different.  \n\nIn Tanganyika, the British walked in and found a people literate, a people reading. The Germans, they'd planted seeds there, watered them with knowledge. Kamerun too, whispers say, flourished under their tutelage.  But in this land, South West Africa, a different story unfolded.  A barren land, harsh and unforgiving, mirroring the spirit of the men who held dominion over it. \n\nHere, the schools were not the province of the state, no, that was left to the missionaries, these men with their Bibles and their hunger for souls.  The government, they poured resources into the education of their own, building schools, shaping minds in their own image.  But for the natives, for the black men and women, the path to literacy was a dusty, forgotten trail. \n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other German colonies boasted educated Africans, here, the vast majority remained silent, illiterate, swallowed by the silence of their own ignorance. \n\nWhat brought about this stark contrast? What drove the Germans to this systematic neglect? This paper seeks to delve into the heart of this paradox, to expose the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial masters, the fear and the prejudice that shaped this desolate landscape of learning.  \n\nThe records tell their stories, these dusty tomes written in languages both familiar and foreign. They speak of schools and systems, of progress and neglect, of the clash of cultures and the triumph of blindness.  Cohen, he wrote about this, about the stark difference between East and West Africa. He saw the settlers, the driving force behind this educational apartheid, the key to understanding this land's silent sorrow.\n\nThis land, South West Africa, a land of harsh beauty, a land where the sun beat down mercilessly, where the wind carried the whispers of forgotten languages. The white men, they came seeking gold and opportunity, a land to claim as their own.  But they overlooked the people, the living souls who inhabited this land. They saw them as obstacles, as shadows to be ignored.",
            "The dust of a hundred years has settled on the music, blurring the lines between genres. A hundred years of names piled high, each one a branch on the sprawling, thorny tree of Popular Music: Rock, Folk, Jazz, Country, Rap - a lexicon of sound, and beneath each branch, a thousand more.  Heavy Metal, born in the grimy crucible of the last forty years, is a testament to that chaos, a symphony of shadows and screams.\n\nIt’s a music of excess, a music of depth. It cuts, it bleeds, it aches with a raw intensity that bleeds from the depths of the soul. It is not a gentle music, but a music that wrestles with the darkness, that stares into the abyss and screams back.   \n\nFrom the beginning, the seeds of rebellion were sown. The first tendrils of Metal snaked out, branching into a thousand unholy offshoots. Subgenres, sub-subgenres, a hydra of sound, each one a reflection of some hidden terror, some unspoken truth. \n\nNow, the forest is choked with the tangled undergrowth of Metal’s progeny.  It has swallowed whole the traditions of other genres, twisting them into something new, something savage. Its roots run deep, drawing sustenance from the primal darkness that whispers at the edge of our dreams.\n\nBut to truly understand this beast, to grasp the essence of its fury, one must first go back to its source.  Go back to the moment when darkness gave birth to sound, when chaos became a symphony.\n\nFor Metal is not merely a genre, it is a movement. A movement fueled by a hunger for something more, something real, something primal. A movement born of drugs, of despair, of the desperate need to express the darkness that festers within us all. \n\nIt is a music that sings of anger, of pain, of the fragility of existence. It is a music that does not shy away from the shadows, but embraces them. \n\nAnd in those shadows, in the heart of the storm, we find the true soul of Metal.",
            "The man in the smoky room, the one they called Rousseau, he'd been painting his dreams for years. Not the kind that come in the dead of night, but the ones that woke him with the rasp of want. Dreams of color, of light, of a canvas that breathed back at him. A dream of seeing his name etched in the annals of art, not the back of some dusty ledger. But the world, it spat on dreams like a dog on a bone.  \n\nHe'd been a customs man, a gabelou they called him, a tollkeeper on the edge of things.  The work kept him fed, but it choked his soul. He yearned to paint, to build worlds with brushstrokes and pigment, to show them what lay hidden beneath the surface of things. He started late, a man pushing forty with calloused hands and a heart full of longing.\n\nHe'd seen the work of those fine artists, the ones who flitted about Paris like moths to a flame. They painted with ease, with a confidence he could only dream of. He yearned to be like them, to be recognized, to be heard. But his work, it was different. Raw. Unpolished. A whisper in a shout.\n\nHe painted his dreams, the ones that haunted him, the ones that both terrified and comforted him. He painted jungles teeming with life, women draped in moonlight, landscapes that stretched out into eternity. He painted what he saw, what he felt, what he yearned for.\n\nBut the art world, it was a cold mistress. She demanded conformity, obedience. She wanted artists who followed the rules, who painted what she told them to paint. And Rousseau, he refused. He painted his truth, his own vision of the world. \n\nHis \"Dream,\" that's what they called it. A woman lost in a world of fantasy, a world of his own making. A world where the impossible was real, where the mundane was magical. He poured his heart and soul into that painting, his longing, his frustration, his defiance. \n\nHe knew they wouldn't understand. He knew they'd scorn him, dismiss him as a naive fool. But he didn't care. He painted for himself, for the sake of the dream. Because in the end, it was his dream, and his alone.",
            "The air  hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A truth hung there too, unspoken, a thing that sat heavy in the chest like a stone. The old men, the thinkers, they'd said it for years – that beauty and truth were two sides of the same coin, bound together by some unseen thread.  Like Keats in his poems, they'd whispered of beauty as truth, and truth as beauty.  But what did it mean? What did it mean to know a truth so deep it felt like a wound, a truth so raw it bled into the very fabric of your being?\n\nWe learn things, sure. We cram facts and figures into our heads, soak up knowledge like a sponge. But these truths, these ethical knots, these aesthetic pangs, they weren't learned things. They burrowed into you, took root, bloomed in the dark places of the soul. We try to explain them, dissect them, analyze them like specimens under a glass.  We talk about brushstrokes and bone structures, moral codes and personal narratives.  But it's not enough. Something always remains, a shadow across the light, an echo in the silence.  \n\nTake a picture, for instance.  You can break down the composition, the light, the shadows. You can say it's a masterpiece or a sham, a snapshot of a moment in time. But that doesn't tell you why it grabs you by the throat and squeezes, why it leaves you breathless and hollow-eyed. It's that something else, the ineffable, the unspoken. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, sometimes the truth is just too big to say. It has to be told, woven into a story, a tapestry of words that bleeds with feeling.  And like Wittgenstein, I believe there are truths that can't be spoken, only felt.  They're out there, in the liminal spaces, the spaces between the lines, the spaces where the soul breathes. \n\nMaybe that's why art and ethics are so intertwined. Because they both speak to that ultimate truth, the one that lies just beyond our grasp.  They show us the world, not as it is, but as it could be, as it might have been, as it yearns to be. They teach us to see the beauty in the broken, the meaning in the meaningless, the hope in the ashes.",
            "The wind scrapes across the plains of Germany.  A cold wind. A wind that whispers stories of iron and fire, of tribes that fought beneath a sky the color of pewter.  From the shadowed Alps where Munich stands, its breath held tight against the chill, to the salt-laced air of Kiel on the Baltic, it carries the same scent:  a blend of earth and ash, of ancient wood smoke.  The Rhine winds through Köln, a serpent of silver, and the Saxon city of Dresden, born on the Elbe, echoes its song. This is a land conjoined from fragments, a mosaic of tribes and tongues, woven together by the threads of time.\n\nThe name Germania, a ghost on the wind, clings to the land like the scent of pine needles.  Its meaning, lost in the mists of ages, is a bone gnawed clean by time. Tacitus, that chronicler of shadows, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that had crossed the Rhine, leaving behind a trail of fire and steel. Their battles with the Gauls, he wrote, were like storms, their fury a tide that swept across the land. Caesar, the Roman eagle, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicle of conquest. He used it to mark the boundary between the conquered and the unconquered, a line drawn in blood and iron. Some whisper that the word came from the Gauls themselves, a word that carried the sting of fear, a sound that meant \"those who dwell beyond the river.\" Others say it came from the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon that danced in the hands of warriors, a whisper of death on the wind.  \n\nTacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" painted a picture of a people untouched by the tide of civilization.  He saw them as primordial, untouched by the migrations and wars that shaped the world. Their lands, he wrote, were wild, their skies a canvas of storms, their faces etched with the harsh beauty of the north.  Who would leave the warmth of Rome, the comfort of vast cities, for the harsh embrace of Germania? Only those who were born of its soil, who knew its secrets, who spoke its language.\n\nRome, for all its might, never fully conquered Germania. They sent their legions to its borders, seeking riches and glory, but they never truly possessed its heart. They traded with the tribes, they fought with them, and they took what they could, but in the end, they retreated, leaving behind a land that remained stubbornly free.  \n\nAnd so, Germania lived on. A land of forests and mountains, of rivers and plains, a land of indomitable spirit. A land whose story is still being written.",
            "The water stared back, a mirror of the abyss in my gut. Brown. Just brown.  No swirls, no play of light.  It was a truth laid bare, a solid, unyielding thing.  Thoughts, like flies, buzzed around the edges, skittering and fleeting.  None of them settled.  This wasn't art. It wasn't even the beginning of a story. More like the end.  The final, ugly scene.\n\nI'd read somewhere, maybe in one of those art books, about how to see. To strip things down. To find the essential line, the core of the thing.  Like a frame around a bowl of fruit, they said.  But there was no frame for this. Just the brown, and the stink. \n\nPicasso, Monet, they all had their colors. Their worlds.  My world was brown.  This brown.  The brown of regret, the brown of failure.\n\nMy hand gripped the handle, knuckles white.  Muscle memory took over, a practiced movement. But this time, it felt wrong.  The water stirred, a ripple of disgust. A piece broke free, a dark, shapeless thing.  It drifted, then sank.  I tried again. The flush, a weak sigh.  Still there.\n\nThe mop lay limp in my hand, a useless white flag.  A green tie choked me, a symbol of some forgotten occasion.  I stared at the brown, my mind a blank slate.  No thoughts, no inspiration, just the weight of it.\n\nThe toilet paper, a thin sheet of hope, felt flimsy against the cold porcelain.  I wrapped it, layer by layer, a shroud.  My hand, buried deep, felt the slickness, the cold.  A mother's touch, they said, but this wasn't love.  It was resignation.\n\nThe brown held fast.",
            "The road is a graveyard for boys.  A blacktop river choked with the bones of youth. Too many of them, slick and young, behind the wheel, their eyes bright with the recklessness of a dawn that never comes. It's in their blood, this need for speed, this hunger for the open road. The doctors say their minds ain't built for it, that the circuits ain't fused, the wires ain't set. But they crave it all the same, the rush, the feeling of being untouchable. And they die for it, these boys, in a thousand twisted heaps of metal and glass.\n\nCalifornia, they say, tried to hold them back, to clip their wings with their licenses, to make them wait, to teach them patience. But patience ain't a virtue these young ones understand. They're driven by something else, something primal, something that whispers in their ears, urging them forward, whispering of freedom and of escape.\n\nZuckerman, the psychologist, he knows. He sees it in their eyes,  the glint of the abyss, the yearning for the fall. They want to feel alive, to test the boundaries, to see how close they can get to the edge before they lose their grip.\n\nAnd the edge is always there, waiting. A curve in the road, a patch of black ice, a reckless passenger, a sudden phone call. All it takes is a moment, a split second, and the world can be turned upside down.\n\nThey say millions more are coming, these children of the boomers, ready to take their place behind the wheel. They'll learn the same lessons, the hard way, the way all their predecessors have.\n\nMaybe there's a way to stop it, to turn the tide. Maybe there's a way to teach them to wait, to find their freedom in other ways, to understand the weight of the responsibility they carry. \n\nBut for now, the road remains a graveyard.  And the boys keep coming, drawn to its seductive danger, their hearts beating a reckless rhythm against the cold steel of their fate.",
            "In the dim glow of the Library of Congress archives, I sifted through Edison's dusty films, a collection of trickery from the nascent days of cinema. Fifteen flickers of artifice, cobbled together between '95 and '01. Illusions spun from the alchemy of editing, each frame a whisper of magic. My gaze fell upon these early attempts, seeking the poetics woven into their silent narratives. Some adhered to the stark simplicity of the time, others dared to breach the boundaries.\n\nThese phantoms of the silver screen, they were tethered to their stage. A proscenium arch framing each tableau, the camera a watchful eye, unmoving, fixed in its gaze. A stage borrowed from the theatre, a legacy of vaudeville, a whisper of the magic lantern. Figures danced within this confined space, confined to movements side to side, their paths never leading toward or away from the lens.  \n\nConsider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a 1900 apparition. Actors enter from the right, their journey confined to the horizontal plane, vanishing off-screen, leaving the camera behind, uncaring.\n\nLong shots, and occasionally a glimpse of the medium, were the only windows into this world. Close-ups? A foreign concept, unheard of in these spectral halls. A relic of the stage, where the entire tableau unfolded before the audience, framed by the proscenium's embrace.\n\nEach trick, a self-contained unit. One thought, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting breath in time. A vaudeville skit, a magic trick, a vanishing act, all compressed into a silent symphony. A single concept, a single shot, a single breath. But trickery, as it is wont to do, hides its seams. One conceptual shot, a phantom in the viewer's eye, may be a tapestry woven from multiple threads, each frame a stitch in the illusion.\n\nObserve \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a film from 1895. A closer look reveals the seams, the hidden joins, the moment where the severed head appears, a phantom born of artifice.",
            "The wind scoured the plains of Carolina, a constant, bleak presence. John Taylor, a man forged in the crucible of soil and sun, knew its bite as well as he knew the feel of weathered wood beneath his calloused hands.  He was a man of words, a man of purpose, his life a testament to the grit of the land he tilled. But his mind was a fortress, its walls built of conviction and the unwavering belief in a government that served the land, not the other way around.  He saw himself as a shepherd, guiding the flock of men toward a pasture of liberty, a land where the tiller of the soil held dominion.\n\nThis land, this republic, was a blank canvas, a chance to paint a masterpiece of freedom. He'd seen the rot of old ways, the shackles of tradition holding men down like bound cattle. He believed in the inherent goodness of man, a spark that needed only the right conditions to ignite.  But that spark, he knew, could also be twisted, consumed by greed and ambition. \n\nThat's why he fought for a government as lean and unforgiving as the winter winds, a government that kept its distance, allowing men to shape their own destinies.  He saw the danger in a leviathan, its tentacles reaching into every corner of life, smothering the very soul of independence.  He believed in a Constitution that was a sacred covenant, its words etched not in stone, but in the blood and sweat of men who yearned for freedom.  The Declaration, a beacon in the night, its light guiding them toward a future where the individual mattered, where the land was not a prize to be plundered but a birthright to be cherished.\n\n\n\nHe saw the world in shades of black and white, good and evil, a constant struggle between the two.  He saw the inherent flaws in man, the lust for power that gnawed at the heart of every leader, but he also saw the potential for greatness, the yearning for a world where every man could stand tall, unburdened by the yoke of tyranny.  He knew that the path was fraught with peril, that the wolves of despotism prowled the shadows, waiting to devour the innocent. But he clung to the belief that man, in his own time, could rise above his baser instincts and build a world worthy of the sacrifices made by those who came before.",
            "A cold wind blew through the pines. The figures in the logs, they dropped like stones in the third month. A sudden, hard fall. Disheartening. Winter had come to the campus, a gray pall with the onset of frost. Fewer bicycles, fewer walkers on the road. December, the semester's end. The air thick with the scent of burnt sugar and the hollowness of empty halls. A time for books, for packing, for goodbyes.  Maybe the log slips had fallen from minds preoccupied with the year's leaving. And then, the holidays, a long exhale, a silence. The campus, nearly a ghost town, students scattered to their homes, the faculty gone. January, the new year, a thin sliver of light cutting through the darkness. Then February, a hollow month, a gray echo. \n\nThe project, a bright spark at first, a flare in the darkness. But the flame flickers, its light dimming. To fight this, they conjured the Carpool Challenge Week, a burst of fire in March. The logs, they rose again, a brief resurgence. \n\nThe truth is, this battle was fought on two fronts. One, the natural ebb and flow of fervor. The other, the hold of the car, a deep-rooted comfort in a land where freedom is measured in miles driven. A siren song.  \n\nTo entice, they offered gifts: tokens of appreciation, whispers of reward.  Gift certificates to local haunts, places of comfort and respite. But what if they'd offered more? A bicycle, a hybrid's sleek promise, the silent hum of an electric dream? Would that have held the line, kept the logs full? Perhaps.\n\nThe prizes, they remained constant throughout the project. A steady hand, a steady reward. But what if they had evolved, grown in value with the passing months? A promise of greater things, a crescendo of incentive.  Imagine, a whisper of a bicycle in December, then the full promise of a hybrid in January. A silent, seductive lure.",
            "The dust of the market swirls. A thing called an ETF, they call it. A traded fund. Like a stock, they say, but it holds a basket of things. An index, a commodity, maybe even a handful of other stocks.  They say it gives you the spread of an index fund, the  lean of a single stock. You can short it, they say, lever it, buy in small bites. But it ain't free. A commission, they call it, for every trade.  Like a toll on the road to wealth.\n\nAnd the ratios, the expense ratios, they whisper. Lower than a mutual fund, they say. But is that enough? Is the promise of diversification, this phantom word, truly there? Or is it a mirage in the desert of the market?\n\nThis, then, is our examination.

Will the sum of their swings be different from the swing of the whole?\n\nThe market holds its breath. The dust settles. We wait for the answer.",
            "The land of dreams, that phantasm Poe called Dream-Land, it holds shadows deep. In it, he whispers of Thulé, a name echoing from Virgil, a lost isle north of Britain's shore, the edge of the known world. Virgil, yes, but there's another wind whispering these words, a German wind. Poe, he drank deep from the well of German thought. \n\nKarl J. Arndt, he saw it clear, the kinship between Poe and Goethe's Mignon. He saw it in the lines, a mirrored grief.  Poe, he borrowed the echoes, some say, crafting his own melancholy in the shadow of the master. \n\nOxford whispers of Goethe's Faust, a towering figure in the landscape of German verse. Two parts, like a heartbeat, the first in 1808, the second in the year of Goethe's passing, 1832. Within that shadowed second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" unfolds. A king, broken by loss, his queen gone, a goblet left as a phantom reminder. He drinks, he weeps, he sees only the ghost of her face in the fading light. The cliff calls, the goblet falls, and he, like a shattered mirror, breaks himself upon the edge of oblivion. \n\nPoe, he knew this king, this mirror image of grief. Could he not see himself reflected there? In the echoing halls of \"Dream-Land,\" the king's despair finds a kindred spirit. In the desolate landscape of Poe's poem, the speaker wanders, haunted by the shades of lost friends, trapped in a world drained of color and life. \n\nThulé, a bookend to Poe's dreams, a final echo of loss. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they breathe the same air of sorrow. \n\nAnd Goethe?

A half hour. That’s all it took. Half an hour for a man to know, to be told, to turn from his dinner and do what was right. But Paul Martin, the manager, had chosen hunger over heed. Twice he was warned. Twice he dismissed the danger. Twice he let the slickness linger, a silent invitation to disaster. He knew. He knew the aisles of D&D Markets were slick with peril. He'd seen the others fall before, the five who'd stumbled and broken in the same year, victims of his negligence. But still, the applesauce remained, a testament to his callousness. He was a shepherd who ignored his flock, a captain who steered his ship into the storm. And now, Jennifer Palmer, a woman with dreams and a future, lay broken on the cold floor, her back a canvas for pain.\n\nA judge, they say, will not be kind to Martin. The law whispers of malice, of a disregard so profound, so willful, that it transcends mere negligence. It speaks of actions fueled not by mistake, but by a cold indifference to the suffering that might result. The question becomes, was Martin's choice to eat, to ignore, a choice born of malice? Did he know, deep in his heart, that he was playing with fire?  Did he know, and did he care? \n\nThe state of California offers a glimpse into the mind of a judge. They speak of \"despicable\" acts, of a disregard for the \"rights and safety\" of others. Can Martin's actions, his callous indifference, be labeled as such? \n\nThe evidence whispers: a manager warned twice, a spill left unattended, a woman shattered. The whispers grow louder, echoing the question: Was it malice that led to Jennifer Palmer's fall?",
            "The dust of the years had settled on that classroom, on the worn floorboards and the sweat-stained backs of the wooden chairs. Four years gone now, a blink in the long march of time. Islam, they called it. The word itself, sharp and foreign on the tongue. Back then, the air crackled with the heat of debate. Hostile? Was it a religion born of rage, a sword brandished against the world? Or was it something else entirely?  \n\nThe world had shifted since then, tilted on its axis like a drunken dancer. The towers had fallen, the dust had choked the sky, and the faces on the news had hardened, their eyes reflecting the fear. Islam, once demonized, now bathed in an unsettling light of tolerance. A president with a name like Borac Obama, a name whispered with suspicion, yet somehow embraced. The world, like a river, finds its own course, carving new paths through the bedrock of belief.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tangled thread woven through time, drew him in. He had known the tales, the conquest, the subjugation, the fire of faith forced down the throats of the unwilling. But this biography, it painted a different picture. A humble man, misunderstood, a voice crying in the wilderness. People drawn to him like moths to a flickering flame, not by the sword, but by the light in his eyes.\n\nYet, the echo of another story lingered, a ghost in the air. The miracles, the multiplying loaves and fishes, a mirror reflecting the deeds of a different prophet, a different savior. A flicker of unease, a suspicion that history was being rewritten,  a sacred narrative reshaped to fit a new mold.\n\nThe voices of the witnesses, distant echoes through the years, whispered their tales. But the distance, the layers of retelling, cast a shadow of doubt. Was it truth, or was it a carefully constructed edifice, built upon the shifting sands of hearsay?\n\nThe portrait that emerged, a man of gentleness and wisdom, seemed at odds with the historical record. The shadows of his past, the whispers of conquest and bloodshed, refused to be silenced.  Could they reconcile the man of peace with the warrior king? Could faith truly flourish in the crucible of violence?",
            "The word of the Lord, it went out and scattered. Like leaves in a storm.  The man, the figure in the light, he spoke, and they heard. They built temples, wrote scriptures, spun stories.  But the wind it shifted, time it turned, and the words themselves grew faint.  They became tangled in weeds, choked by the dust of forgetting.\n\nNow the world spins on, a wheel beneath a cold, indifferent sky. Progress, they call it.  Men march forward, their eyes fixed on the horizon, blind to the bones beneath their feet. They think themselves enlightened, but the darkness closes in.  They see not the shadows lengthening, the whispers in the wind.\n\nThey speak of a return, a yearning for something lost.  A flicker of a flame in the heart, a longing for the bedrock of things.  A time when the man's voice shook the earth, when his words were fire and his touch was grace.\n\nYears will turn to dust, centuries to ash. But the memory will linger.  It will rise up like a ghost, a chill in the marrow, a whisper in the night. They will seek him, the man, the source, the wellspring. They will strip away the layers, the accretions, the bones of dogma and reach for the flesh, the blood, the word.\n\nAnd when they find it, when they taste the salt of truth on their tongues, the world will change. Not in a blaze of fire, not with trumpets and armies. But in a slow, creeping thaw, a softening of the heart, a loosening of the hold.  They will remember.  They will be whole.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, it will stand.  A pillar in the storm, a beacon in the night.  But its face will be changed.  For the clock, it will turn backward.  The rivers will flow upstream.  And the world will be young again.",
            "The smoke rose black against the sky, a shroud for the city of bone and steel. They called it progress, these men with their bellies full and their eyes vacant. They saw not the grime, not the sickness, not the hollow sockets where hope used to burn. They saw only profit, a river of it flowing from the sweat and blood of the huddled masses.  \n\nSinclair called it Packingtown, but it felt more like a tomb. A tomb built on the backs of men, women, and children, each cog in a machine that ground them down,  leaving behind only dust and despair.  The river itself, once a source of life, was now a choked artery of filth, thick with the refuse of their greed. The air hung heavy, a miasma of rot and despair. \n\nThese men, these lords of industry, they were wolves in fine suits, their hearts black as the coal that fueled their furnaces. They saw the workers not as men, but as cattle, to be driven and prodded,  their lives expendable in the pursuit of wealth. A dollar here, a penny there, the sum of their concern. They saw no humanity in the cracked hands, the hollow eyes, the coughs that choked the life from their lungs. \n\nThey built their empires on the backs of the broken, the forgotten, the desperate.  They knew their workers were slaves, not in chains, but in chains of poverty and fear.  There was no escape, no safety net, no chance for redemption.  The system was rigged, designed to keep them down, to keep them docile, to keep them silent.\n\nSinclair saw it all, this festering wound upon the soul of the nation. He wrote it down, a testament to the cruelty, the indifference, the utter depravity of it all. He cried out against the injustice, against the darkness that threatened to consume them all.",
            "The world is painted in shades, a palette of meaning the man with the pen lays down. Fitzgerald, he calls himself.  Fitzgerald knows how to bleed a color, to make it sing. It ain't just the sight of it, it's what it whispers. Like gold, it can shimmer with promise, or turn to dust in your hand. Green, it can be the yearning in a man's heart, or the rot of decay. White and gray, they dance together, a mournful waltz. White, the color of a lie whispered sweet, the promise of a dream. Gray, the dust settling on that dream, the weight of time. And red, pink, they bleed into each other, a fever dream, the flush of passion, and the stain of blood.\n\nFitzgerald, he builds these meanings slow, brick by brick, word by word.  He paints a picture with them, and you see it clear as day. Daisy, she's wrapped in white, always in white. A porcelain doll, beautiful, but cold.  Her world, it's all white, the parties, the clothes, the faces.  It's the world of the rich, the privileged, the ones who don't know the taste of ash.  And then there's the gray. The gray of the valley, the gray of the forgotten, the gray of a life lived in the shadow of something brighter. It's the color of Gatsby's dreams, fading, turning to ash.\n\nHe paints them together, these colors, and you see the truth. The emptiness of the white, the hollowness of the gray. He makes you feel it, the ache in your chest, the longing for something more. Fitzgerald, he's a master.\n\nHe paints a picture, not with a brush, but with words. And you see the world through his eyes.",
            "The land breathed out dust, dry and cracked under the sun. San Diego County, they called it. A place of plenty, choked with tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens spilling over the hills like spilled secrets. But the air held a weight, a yolk of something stale and forgotten. The sun, it never really quit beating down, a hammer on the land, forging a life of sweat and toil.\n\nThey spoke of organic farms, these pockets of green in the dusty expanse. They were like whispers in the wind, promises of a better way. A way to coax life from the earth without poisoning it, a way to fill the bellies of men and the souls of birds. \n\nThey said there were waiting lists for this bounty, a hunger for the clean taste of a world untouched by man’s greed.  Eggs and milk, the color of dawn, pure and untouched.  They offered tours, glimpses into a world where the earth was not a conquered beast but a partner, a companion.\n\nBut the whispers, they weren't always kind.  They spoke of harder labor, of battles fought against weeds and pests with only sweat and song. Of losses, the sting of failure in a land that demanded its due. The scales tipped, they said, favoring the large, the loud, the ones who drowned the earth in chemicals and reaped the harvest in bitter silence.\n\nStill, they clung to the hope. A hope that the land itself could be healed, that the symphony of life could be restored. They sought refuge in the shadows of government programs, a lifeline tossed out to those who dared to dream of a different future. They spoke of biodiversity, of a patchwork quilt of life woven into the fabric of the earth.  Trees reaching for the sky, birdsong filling the air, a world where man and nature danced in a fragile, beautiful balance.\n\nThe land, it held its secrets close. A parcel of 160 acres, a tapestry of chaparral and oak woodland, whispering tales of indigenous spirits and weathered cattle trails. The ghosts of homesteaders, their names etched in the bones of the earth, lingered still.\n\nThey chose this land, a sliver of hope in a world teetering on the brink. A place to build a future, a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. A place to heal the earth, one seed at a time.",
            "The wind scours the bones of a place. Culture, it ain't a thing you can hold in your hand, not like a fist. It's the dust that settles in the hollows, the taste of ash on the tongue, the way a man looks at the ground when he speaks. \n\nYou can't say all Frenchmen are lovers or all Englishmen are stoic, that's just the wind howling through empty barns. Culture's a ghost story told a thousand times, each telling a little different, a little darker. \n\nWhen you sit across from a stranger, his face a map of truths and lies, you see your own face staring back. Maybe that's why the world's so hard, why the heart cracks open at the sight of a familiar scar.\n\nBut you can't judge a man by the dust on his coat or the way he holds his pipe. You gotta listen to the silence between the words, the way his eyes track the shadows. See the ghosts in the corners of his mind.\n\nThere's a hunger in the air, a gnawing need to understand. But the truth is, you can't fully grasp another man's soul, no matter how hard you try. You're just two travelers on a road that leads nowhere, each carrying the weight of your own stories. \n\nAnd in the end, the only currency that matters is trust. A fragile thing, like a flame in the wind.\n\nThat's the thing about culture, about people. It's a dance in the dark. You take a step, they take a step, and sometimes you stumble, sometimes you fall. But you keep dancing, because there's nowhere else to go.",
            "The fool’s tongue, it whispers, “There is no God.”  The words crawl from Psalm 14, the same words that coil around Anselm’s argument, a serpent seeking purchase in the heart of belief. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same phantom, the God of the Bible, the God of fire and brimstone, the God of whispered promises. To compare them, we must accept this God, this entity, as the bedrock upon which they build their case.  To stray from this path would be to wander into a wilderness of gods, a chaos of shadows.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the confines of the mind.  He says that God exists because we know him, because to conceive of his absence is to stumble against the very fabric of understanding.  It's a truth born of contemplation, a light flickering within the skull. But is this truth enough? Can the mind, this fragile cage of bone and sinew, truly hold the weight of divinity?\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path. His God is a God of reason, a God who can be apprehended through the logic of the world, through the patterns of creation.  He lays out five arguments, five pillars of proof. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, harmony.  Each one a brick laid in a wall, a wall designed to contain the divine within the bounds of human comprehension.\n\nBut are these arguments truly convincing? Does logic alone suffice to build a bridge to the infinite? Or do they, like Anselm’s faith, remain tethered to the limitations of the human mind?\n\nBoth men, they seek to prove the existence of God, but their methods diverge. One looks inward, the other outward.  And yet, neither truly offers a holistic understanding, a complete map of the divine.  Perhaps the truth, it lies somewhere beyond their reach, veiled in mystery, waiting to be discovered by a mind yet to be born.",
            "Dust settled on the road. A prince was born, they say, in some time long gone. Some fifth or sixth century before the reckoning. They called him Buddha. He walked away from the world, they say, found some kind of peace in the shadows and the quiet. His words took root and spread, bloomed into a religion. Buddhism they called it. The Theravada kind being the purest, they say.  Old as time, twenty-five hundred years or more. But the world shifts. The things that held meaning then, they don't hold the same weight now. Look at Sri Lanka, where they cut the water still. Monks and men, all joining hands in a ritual. Some kind of ceremony. But Buddha, they say, never spoke of such things. The changes in the faith, they run deep. From the surface whispers to the heart of the matter.\n\nThe monks, the layfolk, they've had to adjust. Turn the scriptures, reshape the meaning. Forces from the inside and the outside, both good and bad, they've been at play.\n\nThere are words we'll be using a lot, see. Inside and outside. Inside means the ones who follow the Buddhasasana, monks and layfolk alike. Outside means anything that comes from those who don't.  And then there's the good and the bad. The bad ones, they want to hurt the faith, see. Their words are like thorns, aimed at the heart of the Buddha's teachings. The good ones, they don't mean to help or harm. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's just the way things are.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the heart of it all. The core beliefs of Theravada Buddhism. They find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, that's the teachings, the Tripitaka, the three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka, that's the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, especially for the monks. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that's the deeper stuff, the metaphysics.  No soul, they say. Suffering is all there is. Everything changes. Only by seeing this can you escape the cycle of birth and death, the Sansara.  And along with it, desire, hatred, delusion, they all fade away. Enlightenment comes.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka, it lays down the rules. Five precepts for the layfolk: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't lust, don't get drunk. The monks, they have many more rules to follow. The most important thing, though, is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, suffering comes from clinging. Third, suffering can be overcome. Fourth, the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The sun bled through the haze, a pale ghost of its former self, casting long shadows on the dusty plains. It hung low in the sky, the same sky that had witnessed the slow burn of a rivalry, a feud as old as the land itself.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of animosity that stretched back over half a century, from the year 1836 to the cusp of a new century in 1893.  A war, the Mexican-American War, scarred the land, a wound that festered for years. Texas, the Southwest, these territories bled away from Mexico, claimed by the United States in a bloody conflict.\n\nThe clash wasn't just over land, though. It was a clash of worlds, of cultures and beliefs, a storm of different gods and devils raging in the hearts of men. Religion, tradition, a hunger for something more, these things drove the nations apart, fueled the fires of resentment. They circled each other, wary beasts, always ready to strike.\n\nThis wasn't unique, this rivalry.  Borders, those lines drawn in the sand, often breed conflict. Nations, like wolves in the night, eyeing each other's territory, their needs and desires a tangled web of greed and fear.  The United States, a wolf with a hunger for expansion, found itself fixated on these southern neighbors, Mexico and Cuba, a constant thorn in its side.\n\nReligion, that ever-present force, cast a long shadow.  The Americans, wary of Catholicism, of monarchy, saw in Mexico a reflection of their own past, a history they sought to shed.  This wasn't unlike the Cold War, a battle not just of ideologies, but of souls.  The United States, like a child guarding its toys, feared the influence of Mexico, its ancient beliefs a threat to its own.\n\nThe land itself bore the scars of this conflict.  Border disputes, raids, whispers of violence - these were the echoes of a past that refused to die.  Outlaws, bandits, ghosts of history roamed the dusty plains, their footsteps a reminder of the fragility of peace.\n\nFor a time, the United States, the bigger, stronger wolf, triumphed.  Mexico, forced to bow to its will, became dependent, a shadow of its former self.  But the hunger of power never truly sates.  The United States, its gaze shifting, now sought not land, but control, manipulating the economy, the strings of power.\n\nThe rivalry, a slow burn over decades, finally flickered and died.  But the ghosts of the past lingered, a reminder that peace is a delicate dance, a fragile thing, easily shattered by the winds of change.",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came upon me sudden, unexpected. A thing I’d never known. Nurse I was then, tending to others. Chosen it for the kind of peace it promised. A life of steady work, a life where sickness would always be, always need tending. A mantra, whispered from childhood: *You'll always find work, people will always get sick.*  My own dreams, they'd lain fallow – science, perhaps, or words put to paper, a blend of both.  But nursing, that was the safe choice. \n\nYet here I was. Forty-six years walked, single, pockets as bare as a winter wind. The sickness, it took hold, a thief in the night. Fifteen years on,  the world spins on, but I’m caught in the undertow. Social Security, a thin thread, that’s all that keeps me afloat. Nothing left to call my own, not a single thing. Every day a struggle, a gnawing at the edges of security, safety, and the thin veil of self-respect. The world’s a shaky thing, uncertain. But one truth shines clear: Without the hand of family, the kindness of friends, I’d be swallowed whole. In the face of real disaster, you discover just how fragile the human spirit can be.\n\nLife, it throws curveballs. Big ones, small ones, they keep coming. No matter how hard you plan, some things are too vast to face alone.\n\nWe talk, these days, about pulling back from the big government, righting the ship before it sinks. And maybe that’s right. But I’d rather see folks learn to trust again, to offer a hand, to ask for help when the world turns cold. We’re not meant to be islands, adrift in a sea of fear.\n\nThe talk is of rugged individualism, the backbone of this nation.  But those who crossed the plains, they didn’t do it by grit alone. They did it with compassion, with respect, with the shared burden of survival. \n\nSo, yes, be ready. I am. I have my supplies – bandages, water tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods. If you have the land, the means, grow your own food, can it, preserve it. A wood stove, a good idea if you’re not stuck in an apartment.\n\nBut while you’re at it, get to know your neighbors.  Build a bridge, not a wall.",
            "The shape a thing takes, why it takes that shape, a question as old as the rocks themselves.  Even now, we barely grasp how to speak of it, how to measure in numbers the slow, creeping dance of change over time. Thompson, he saw it, back in '17, the need for a language beyond words, a way to map the very marrow of creation.  \n\nWe're trying to find that language, to understand how a shell, a spiraled curve of bone, comes to be.  These Prumnu shells, they tell a story, a story in whorl and suture, in the slow widening of the spiral.  We use the eye, but also the eye of the machine,  CerioShell, a program that can spin the numbers, conjure forms, show us the echoes of what might have been, what could yet be.\n\nA shell, it's a journey through time. A tube that winds, a spiral that stretches across space, through 360 degrees. Each turn, a whorl, and the path it takes, the speed it gathers, that's the story written in bone.\n\nImagine the aperture, the mouth of the shell, a point that moves, a traveler tracing its path through time. We can map its journey, its coordinates, the radius of its path. And from those coordinates, we can see the direction of the journey, the constraints that shape it.\n\nThere's a language in the whorls, in the sutures, a language we're just beginning to learn.  It's a language of limits, of possibilities, of the slow, relentless march of change.",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. In Indonesia, the children died.  Not in the quick, sudden violence of storm or flood, but in the slow, suffocating grip of neglect.  For a decade, the numbers had held, a grim plateau against the rising tide of progress that swept through the other facets of life.  Millennium promises, those grand pronouncements of a better world, they were met with a hollow echo.  Water flowed, sanitation improved, yet the children still withered,  their small lives extinguished before they could truly begin.\n\nThey told you of skilled attendants at birth, 72% they claimed, a figure that danced on the edge of meaning.  Midwives, women steeped in the ancient lore of the womb, they counted too.  But what use was lore against the hemorrhage that stole mothers, the fever that choked the newborn?\n\nAnd the diarrhea, a relentless scourge that ravaged the littlest ones.  Fewer sought treatment now, the numbers whispered, a silent retreat from the shadow of illness.\n\nEven the caesarean section, a blade held against the flesh, remained a distant hope.  Only 4% of births received this intervention, a stark reminder of the chasm that yawned between the urban sprawl and the forgotten villages.\n\nThe rich, they had their access, their hospitals glittering under the sun.  But for the poor, the journey was a gamble, the cost a silent killer.  A 27% gap, a canyon of despair separating the haves from the have-nots.\n\nSo what was to be done?  Programmatic solutions, they called them, a bandage for a gaping wound.  But each bandaged wound, a testament to the failure of the whole.  To pour resources into one narrow channel, was to starve the rest.  A grand house built on a single pillar, destined to crumble. \n\nThe answer, it seemed, lay not in quick fixes but in the slow, painstaking work of building a true system, a web of care that reached every corner, every soul.  A system where the whisper of the child's cry was heard, not in the sterile halls of the rich, but in the heart of the village, in the warmth of the mother's embrace.",
            "The dust of vanished worlds clung to the cobblestones, whispering tales of a time when gaslights flickered and carriages clattered, a time before the endless ash choked the air and the sun bled gray. Victorian novels, those monuments to detail and the gilded cages of the aristocracy, held little sway in this bleached landscape. Yet, even in this desolation, echoes of that era linger, twisting in the shadows like phantoms. Two tales, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" rise from the ruins, their mysteries deepened by a touch of the grotesque, a shimmer of the uncanny. They dare to delve into the hearts of their characters, not through the polite pronouncements of drawing-room dialogues, but through a darkness that reflects the soul's own hidden abyss.\n\nThe streets of London, slick with rain and reeking of decay, bleed into Oliver's dreams. His mind, a fractured mirror reflecting the fractured world around him, becomes a stage for fragmented memories and haunting presences.  \n\n> *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese fragmented visions are not mere phantoms of the night; they are the ragged edges of Oliver's shattered reality. Sikes and Crackit, the embodiment of brutality and greed, stalk him even in his dreams, their voices echoing the threat that hangs over him. The gunshot, a jarring punctuation mark in his fractured world, rings out not as a singular event but as a constant torment, a reminder of his vulnerability and the indifference of the world he inhabits. His escape feels less like liberation and more like a descent into a deeper, more insidious darkness. \n\nOn the windswept moors of \"Wuthering Heights,\" shadows dance with a different kind of menace. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, leaving the characters trapped in a cycle of obsession and revenge. The novel's gothic atmosphere, its desolate landscapes and brooding characters,  becomes a crucible where the human heart is twisted and consumed.\n\n\nThe mysteries that shroud both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" are not mere literary devices. They are windows into the darker recesses of the human soul, reflecting the anxieties and terrors that lurk beneath the surface of Victorian society. In a world where appearances can be deceiving and the veneer of civilization is thin, these novels force us to confront the raw, unvarnished truth: that beneath the surface of order and decorum, chaos and madness reign.",
            "The boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, he was a puzzle.  Didn't read right. Some letters, no problem, others…like they were written in a tongue he’d never heard.  Latino, that was for sure, but his English was clean, no accent, no stammer.  He struggled, a plaintive thing, and I wrestled with him over sentences, over sounds, over words that wouldn’t come. It was a back road to nowhere.  \n\nThen his mother came. A quiet woman, Spanish her only song. I knew just a few words, enough to hold a line, a thread.  But when she spoke, her hands tracing her son’s face, understanding bloomed, slow and heavy.  Adrian, he could read, just not the letters. Not the alphabet.  It was a key missing, a lock without teeth.  \n\nThat day, the weight lifted a mite. Not a cure, just a glimpse of the truth.  I don't know if it helped him much.  Hope he’s alright.\n\nThat boy, he's a ghost now, a whisper in the dust.  But he brought a truth to the surface, one that  grabs you by the collar out here in California.  The language barrier, it's a wall, invisible, yet solid.  You think you see a child, you see the struggle, but sometimes the truth hides behind a veil.\n\nIt ain't always obvious.  A kid speaks perfect English, but the letters, they're strangers.  A reading problem, but one born of a different tongue. \n\nAdrian, he was a start, a crack in the wall.   But the whole thing, it's a damn puzzle, a house of cards with too many pieces.  Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL – they’re all tools, but no one tool can fix it. It takes a hand, a mind, a heart. It takes all of us.",
            "The rain came down hard on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the night. We sat on the porch, the air thick with smoke and the smell of wet earth. He was thinner now, my father, his clothes hanging like shrouds. His eyes, though, they still held that same distant light, the kind that looked past the here and now, into some faraway shore.  I asked him about his favorite bird, the way you do when words fail and silence stretches too long. \"A cardinal,\" he said, his voice a rasp.  He watched the water run off the eaves, the gutters overflowing like black rivers into the thirsty earth.\n\nWe'd been told, all of us, that there was something beyond. Something vast and unknowable, waiting out there in the dark.  Some found solace in temples and churches, others in the quiet roar of their own souls. But me, I'd always been drawn to the silence, the emptiness. I sought answers in the rustle of leaves, the whisper of wind through the trees.  \n\nMy father, he never spoke much about it.  Religion, faith, the big questions – they were like ghosts in our house, always present, but never named.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two. Five days after the doctor said there was nothing more they could do. The chemo, the radiation, they just slowed the inevitable.  I didn't want to watch him fade. Didn't want to see the light leave his eyes. So I didn't. I couldn't.\n\nI remember him better this way, in the sunlight, laughing, sharing stories.  Not in the sterile white of a hospital room, his body wracked with pain.\n\nNo one called me when he died. \n\nMaybe they knew. Maybe they knew that I already had him in my heart, a shadow cast by the sun, a memory etched in the bark of a tree.",
            "The Gothic, a word clinging to the husk of its own meaning, an oxymoron twisted from \"Old-New,\" as that Watt fellow put it. Disparaged, praised, accused of emptiness, lauded for a terror that felt somehow grand.  Like a ship caught in a storm, tossed between the shore of the familiar and the edge of the unknown. Walpole, he saw it first, this shape taking form in the dark.  His *Castle of Otranto*, a ghost story spun from threads of the ancient and the modern.  He took the theatrics of the old, the shadows and whispers of forgotten playhouses, and wove them into the new cloth of the novel. A tapestry where the reader, a voyeur in the mind of the story, could see the soul laid bare.  \n\nThe word \"Gothic\" itself, a stain on the canvas of time, had been applied to everything from people to places, a descriptor for the archaic and the crude, a shadow cast upon the bright face of the modern world.  But in this collision, this marriage of the theatrical and the introspective, the Gothic found its foothold. It became a mirror, reflecting both the past and the present, a space where what was lost could be mourned and what was feared could be faced.\n\nAnd within this mirror, the figure of Chivalry rose.  Not the chivalrous knight of old, polished and pristine, but a ghost, a memory, a longing for a better world.  For Walpole, writing in a time of turmoil, the world seemed to be veering off course, the compass broken. He saw the knight, the embodiment of honor and courage, as a forgotten ideal, a beacon in the gathering darkness.  And in his novel, he painted Frederic, a prince, a warrior, a victim, as a flickering flame of that lost ideal.\n\nFrederic, described in words that echo with the cadence of bygone ages, is a figure draped in tragedy, a knight fallen from grace.  His story, a lament for a world that has lost its way.  He is the armor, rusted and worn, the sword dulled but still dangerous.  He is the last echo of a song long forgotten.",
            "The world turns on the back of a mule. Goods and men, both alike, shuffled along the worn tracks of need. From the first whisper of a want to the final sigh of a customer's hand on a purchased prize. A chain it is, forged from the cold steel of necessity. A chain forged back in eighty-two by a man named Oliver, a man who understood the rhythm of want and the song of the market. He spoke of planning, of planting seeds in the dark soil of production and watching them bloom into the fields of supply.  \n\nThere are six stones in this chain, each a facet of the whole. Production, the heart beating in the chest of the system. Supply, the lifeblood coursing through its veins. Inventory, the watchful eyes that measure and guard. Location, the bones that give it shape and form. Transportation, the wind that carries it forward. And information, the whispers that guide its path. \n\nProduction, they say, is where it all begins. It's the forge where raw materials are hammered into shape, where the will of the market is translated into tangible goods. Managers, they stand watch over this process, their minds sharp as scalpels, dissecting the wants and needs of the world. They study the market, a living beast with shifting appetites, and they learn its language. They know what it craves, what it desires, and they build their offerings accordingly.  \n\nThen comes supply, the art of choosing the right partners, the right tools, the right hands to bring the vision to life.  Outsourcing, they call it, a dance between collaboration and competition. To outsource is to choose speed, flexibility, and the promise of lower costs.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, its message a rasping whisper on the street corner. \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, face pale beneath the unforgiving glare of the streetlamps, held it aloft, the Sharpie scrawl stark against the cardboard. Burma. Myanmar. A land choked by a junta's iron fist, a place where the weight of history pressed down like a shroud. \n\nIt was 2007. Monks, saffron robes burning bright against the gray of the dawn, had risen. They walked, chanting, a tide of gold against the khaki. The Saffron Revolution.  A flicker of hope in the suffocating darkness. But the junta, a serpent coiled around the nation's throat, struck back.  \n\nMonasteries became battlegrounds. The air filled with the crack of gunfire, the wail of sirens, the cries of the dying. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were met with imprisonment, with death. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, bled out on the asphalt, his camera still clutched in his hand. \n\nThe official count was a whisper, a lie. Colonel Hla Win, his voice a broken echo from the heart of the storm, spoke of thousands swallowed by the dust, their names lost to the wind. \n\nThis wasn't new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was as old as the world itself.  Roman emperors, gods in their own right, ruled with an iron fist. Japanese emperors, their lineage woven into the fabric of the heavens, claimed dominion over the very souls of their people. And here, in the heart of America, the whispers spoke of a president, a man who sought communion with the darkness, who plotted with the shadows. \n\nTiananmen Square, 1989. A sea of humanity, demanding freedom, met with a storm of steel. The Red Cross whispered of thousands, the government of a few hundred. Their words, like the blood on the pavement, faded into the silence.\n\nRwanda, a decade later. Hutu against Tutsi, a genocide painted in blood. The Butcher of Kigali, a name whispered with fear, orchestrated a symphony of death.\n\nAnd then, the shadow of the Third Reich, a darkness that stretched across the world, a testament to the depths of human depravity. \n\nHitler. Alive in Burma? The sign creaked, a mournful echo in the empty street. Was it a truth too terrible to bear? Or a lie whispered to keep the world watching, afraid?",
            "The man came to see it like this: Duke Ellington’s ghost lived in the music. Not in the piano notes, not much, but in the space between. The space where a man named Bubber Miley could blow a muted trumpet and it sounded like a voice crying out, and where a girl named Baby Cox could scat and it sounded like rain on a tin roof. It was the space where Ellington, his heart and bones, had shaped the sound of the band, made it his own.\n\nHe’d taken those raw notes, those souls set to play, and he’d wove them into something new. A tapestry of sound, each thread a voice, a horn, a beat, all singing together. It wasn’t just the melodies, though those were fine enough. It was the spaces between the notes, the silences, the whispers that made it breathe.  \n\nLike in “Creole Love Call,” that song was a slow burn, a love letter in twelve bars.  The first chorus, the voice and the reeds, a conversation, soft and then rough, like a memory coming back. The trumpet, muted, it wept blues, each note drawn out, dripping with sorrow. The clarinet, it soared high, a lonely bird in the sky. And then the whole band, a chorus of voices, echoing the cry.\n\nAnd then, the last chorus, the voice, it growled, like a beast waking. It wasn’t singing anymore, it was playing, an instrument of the soul.  And then a trombone, a final note, a shiver, a ghost in the wind.\n\nEllington, he knew how to make a sound, how to make it sing. Like in “Hot and Bothered,” the trumpet and the scat, they danced, they argued, they laughed. A conversation in a foreign tongue, understood only by the ears. And in “It Don’t Mean a Thing,” that trombone, it spoke the melody, a low rumble, a promise.\n\nHe’d crafted a world of sound, and in it, he’d made a home.",
            "The ache had been with her, a gnawing emptiness, since she was fourteen. A yearning for something nameless, something unclaimed.  A thirst not quenched by things, but by the touch of another soul.  Boys hadn't interested her, their clumsy advances like moths drawn to a light they couldn't understand. She’d studied herself, dissected her own heart, seeking the reason for this strange, quiet longing. Theories formed and dissipated like smoke in the wind, leaving her with only the echo of the question: why?\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a calm woven from the threads of her parents' gentle natures. Arguments were rare, like storms passing over a still lake. Her own spirit, however, was a restless flame, a wildfire of energy that danced at odds with their placidity. Yet, they loved her, embraced her wildness as a part of their own, a counterpoint to their harmony.\n\nBut today, the peace was shattered. A sharp cry, her mother's voice, thin and strained, sliced through the air. It came from the kitchen, a sharp note of pain.  Panic gripped her.  \"Mom? Mom, what is it?\" she cried, her words tumbling over themselves as she rushed into the room. \n\nThere she was, her mother, fallen on the floor, her face contorted in agony. \"Ow...sweet...hospital...\" her words were fragmented, each one a shard of glass. Her daughter knelt beside her, a wave of helplessness washing over her. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice firm despite the tremor in her heart, \"Just tell me where to take you.\"  \n\nHer mother, her hand trembling, pointed towards the car.  And in that moment, the strength she had cultivated in her own body, honed through years of disciplined practice, surged to the forefront. She lifted her mother, her own muscles straining against the weight, and carried her to the car.  She deposited her gently in the backseat and drove, the world a blur of motion and worry.\n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear, but those weren't the scents that dominated her senses.  It was the raw, sickening fear for her mother that filled her lungs, a suffocating tide. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea in the echoing halls.  Doctors and nurses converged, their faces etched with concern.  \n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool, reaching for a vase on the highest shelf. A simple misstep, an accident, but for now it felt like a betrayal, a violation of the sanctity of their peaceful home.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the study. A whisper on the wind told of the Mediterranean Diet, a way of life built on sun-bleached stones and olive groves.  They called it the aMed diet, a reckoning of the choices laid bare on a plate: more of the earth's bounty – the fruits, the nuts, the grains, the legumes – and less of the animal's flesh, less of the fat that choked the veins.  They measured its worth against the specter of heart disease, seeking a haven in the shadow of a stroke.\n\nOld tales spoke of a light in the belly of the Mediterranean, a glow against the encroaching darkness of sickness.  They'd followed the path of olive oil, a slick trail across the years, and seen a flicker in the lives of those who walked it.  But this time, the whispers focused on the storm – the stroke, the sudden shattering of the vessel.\n\nThey gathered the women, seventy-four thousand strong, their lives unfolding like maps across the land. They were daughters of the earth, nurses tending to a nation's wounds.  From the year 1984 to 2004, six times they held out their hands, offering up their memories of meals past. Each bite, a brushstroke on a canvas of health, recorded in the faded ink of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nAnd they watched, these women, their gazes fixed on the horizon of their own mortality.  The years marched on, relentless as the tide.  Some fell, struck down by the shadow of heart disease, others by the relentless hand of stroke. The stories of their lives, etched in hospital records and death certificates, served as the testament.  \n\nThe women in the highest ranks of the aMed diet, their plates brimming with the earth's bounty, stood tall against the storm.  Their risk, a whisper in the wind, compared to those who had strayed from the path.  The aMed diet, a shield against the darkness, a testament to the enduring strength of the earth's embrace.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, it choked. A sickness spread through the veins of the American economy. Banks, fat and bloated, lay sick with bad blood, their arteries clogged with promises they couldn't keep. The houses, them towers of folly, began to crumble, their foundations built on sand and deceit. Men in suits, eyes glazed with greed, had gambled with the nation's wealth, playing fast and loose with the lives of ordinary folk. \n\nThey called it a crisis. A recession. But it was more than that. It was the death rattle of a dream, the slow, grinding halt of a machine built on lies.  It began in the shadows, in the backrooms of Washington, where the whispers of deregulation slithered through the halls of power. Clinton, he'd chased re-election like a hound on a scent, his nose pressed to the ground, sniffing out the sweet aroma of popularity. He loosened the reins, let the banks run wild, fueled by the cheap blood of sub-prime loans.\n\nAnd the vultures, they circled. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these paper tigers, they devoured the bad meat, packaging it into CDOs and CDSs, a toxic stew of debt that would poison the whole nation. The banks, drunk on their own hubris, piled on, chasing profits with reckless abandon.\n\nThe houses, they rose like monuments to folly, ticking time bombs on the landscape. Adjustable rates, they were called, a seductive promise of cheap dreams made flesh. But the music stopped, and the piper came calling. The payments, they couldn't be met. The houses, they fell. And the blood began to flow.\n\nThe market, it crashed. The banks, they choked. The economy, it shuddered and died. Five trillion dollars, it vanished like smoke in the wind. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, names that once whispered of power, now reduced to dust. \n\nAnd the people, they paid the price. Jobs lost, homes foreclosed, dreams shattered. A generation scarred, forever marked by the stench of failure.\n\nWe stand now, in the ashes of their folly. The question isn't how did it happen? But what will we do about it? Will we learn from the mistakes of the past? Or will we stumble blindly into another abyss, repeating the same sins again and again?",
            "The wind whipped at the gas station, rattling the empty windows like skeletal fingers tapping on glass.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and decay, a graveyard aroma that clung to everything.  He stood on the cracked asphalt, the wind tearing at his threadbare coat.  He thought of the man, the night manager, the man with the tired eyes and the haunted look.  A man who once wore a uniform, a man who traded the roar of engines for the hum of fluorescent lights.  He imagined the man's hands, calloused from years of gripping a fishing rod, now clutching a tired, worn-out rag as he wiped down the counter, the ghosts of breakfast plates and greasy coffee cups still lingering in the air.  He pictured the man's face, etched with the lines of a life lived under a harsh sun, now shadowed by a past he couldn't escape.\n\nHe'd met him once, years ago, a fleeting glimpse in a barroom, a shared glance over a glass of whiskey.  A man who'd seen too much, who carried the weight of untold stories in his eyes.  He'd heard whispers of him, rumors of a past life, of a wife and child lost to the dust and the wind.  He'd heard of the gas station, a lonely outpost on the edge of oblivion, where dreams went to die and memories clung to the air like smoke.\n\nHe turned away, his gaze drawn to the horizon, where the sun bled into the dust-filled sky.  The wind whispered through the empty windows of the gas station, a mournful echo of a life half-lived.  The man was gone, swallowed by the desert, a forgotten soul in a forgotten place.  And here he stood, a stranger in a strange land, searching for a story, a connection, a spark of hope in the vast emptiness.",
            "The television hummed, a pallid light flickering across the worn face of the man in the worn chair. Two stories from Columbus. The first, a man named Hostettler, eyes like a pit in the dark, had taken his wife in Ashley. Multiple times, they said, the blade flashing. Two minutes, that's all it took. A fleck of dust in the vast machine. The second, Travis Buyers, eighteen years old, found shattered in the woods. No names, no faces, only the echo of a gunshot. SWAT combing the shadows, searching for a whisper in the wind. The  night had swallowed him whole.\n\nThen the Med-Flight, a hole punched clean through its belly by a .22. Five thousand dollars for the truth, they promised. But the truth held its tongue, silent in the dark. The rain was coming, they said, a hot, heavy blanket falling on the city. They spoke of temperatures, of the weekend stretching before, a blank canvas.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF. A black man, they said, hoodie pulled low. Six foot tall, a shadow in the night. They lingered on the color, on the details of his darkness.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a kingpin they called him, drugs flowing from Texas like a poisoned river.  Not twenty-five years, no, three hundred months. The number hung in the air, a harsh and hollow clang. A Hispanic, they added, a footnote in the story.\n\nThe screen went dark. Only the hum remained, a low, keening sound. The man in the chair stared at the blankness, a hollow space mirroring the emptiness within.",
            "The blood ties. They run deep. A river black and cold with the mud of forgotten things. Love, hate, envy, the raw knot of them all tangled up inside. Brothers. They see themselves in one another's eyes, clear as the bones beneath the skin. It's in the bad times, the bone-deep dark, that the truth of it shines through. A fire that burns with a pale, gray light.\n\nThere's a cost to this knowledge. A price paid in blood and silence. You look into your brother's eyes and you see not the man the world sees, but the man he truly is. The man he hides from himself. The man he wants to be. And in the wreckage of his actions, you see your own reflection.\n\nDown in the swamps, two brothers walk a path choked with Spanish moss. A path worn smooth by the weight of their unspoken words. One brother, strong, his heart a drumbeat in his chest. The other, frail, his spirit a whisper on the wind. \n\nThey walk towards a storm.\n\nPride, a hard stone in the elder brother's chest. He wants to shape his brother, mold him into the image he himself craves. But the younger brother, he is porcelain, easily broken.\n\nThe landscape, it bleeds with this tension. A symphony of green and decay. The air thick with the smell of rain and death.\n\nAnd in the end, only one will survive.\n\nThe final scene, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow and regret. A brother, broken, his spirit crushed beneath the weight of his own ambition. The other, left standing, a hollow shell, his victory a bitter taste on his tongue.",
            "The mind, it's a dark and tangled thing. Not a machine, though they try to make it so. A box, a book, a goddamn computer – ain't none of it true. It's more like a well, a fathomless well of echoes. Takes in the raw whispers of the world – touch, sound, light – and twists them into something else. Something new. Something…imagined. \n\nSee, the world ain't just what you see. You see a box, black on white, sure. But the mind, it's already building a story around it. A box with what inside? A door? A secret? A whisper of fear? It's a dance, this seeing, a constant back-and-forth between what is and what could be.\n\nAnd then there's the filter. The curtain that falls, choosing what to let through, what to hold back. It's a cruel gatekeeper, letting in the blade of grass you step on, but shutting out the whispers of a thousand unseen things.\n\nBut it's a lonely thing, this well. Memory, it's the only company it has.  A storehouse of ghosts, of things seen and heard and felt. Some fleeting, some clinging on, whispering in the dark.\n\nAnd how it's all organized, that's the real mystery. A tangled web, a map without a guide. Some say it's all connected, a web of meaning spun from the threads of experience. Others say it's shattered, a mosaic of fragments, each one a piece of the whole, but broken beyond repair.\n\nWhatever it is, it's a wonder. A terrifying, beautiful, and ultimately unknowable thing. The mind, it's the last frontier. A wilderness we're only just beginning to explore.",
            "The words of Huxley, a man who saw the shadows lengthening, who felt the chill of a future unblinking in its glass and steel embrace. He laid bare the coming darkness in Brave New World, a vision of a world consumed by its own creation. A world where community choked the individual, where happiness was a manufactured drug, dispensed in measured doses by the World Controller, a puppet master pulling the strings of a society lulled into a synthetic stupor.\n\nHe speaks of technology, a serpent slithering through the veins of humanity, promised as salvation but bearing the venom of its own undoing.  He speaks of capitalism, a machine grinding down the human spirit, its gears oiled by the insatiable hunger for more, for consumption, for the illusion of fulfillment.\n\nMarxism, that ancient scripture of the downtrodden, whispers through the pages of Huxley's work.  Homogeny, the crushing weight of sameness, smothers the soul. Reification, the cold objectification of human beings into mere cogs in the machine, stares back from the vacant eyes of the World State's citizens. \n\nFalse consciousness, that insidious veil woven over the eyes of the masses, blinds them to the true nature of their servitude.  The proletariat, trapped in a web of manufactured desires, their yearning for true connection replaced by the hollow comfort of fleeting pleasures. \n\nHegemony, the iron fist of the ruling class, clenches around the throat of the world, silencing dissent and crushing any flicker of rebellion. The lower castes, the Deltas, Gammas, Epsilons, are mere cattle, herded and controlled, their minds dulled by the endless hum of consumerism.\n\nAnd what of love? What of the burning intensity of human connection?  In this sterile world, it is a forgotten language, a whisper lost in the din of the manufactured masses.  Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth, a hollow echo of the real thing.\n\nHuxley's vision is a bleak one, a warning whispered across the chasm of time. A reminder that the pursuit of progress, untethered from the embrace of humanity, can lead only to a cold and desolate wasteland.",
            "The road to knowledge, they say, is paved with time. But here, on this campus, the road is more like a dust trail, thin and winding, stretching out under a sky ate up by steel and glass. Two and a half years I've walked these paths, measured them in the relentless tick of each clock in each building. East Halls they called it, my first home, a godforsaken outpost, a world away from the heart of things. Willard, they said, a name like a whisper from the past, a place of learning, a place of dust motes dancing in the sunbeams. But to reach it, it felt like crossing a wasteland.\n\nThey built up this place, brick by brick, hope by hope, a monument to progress. The fields, the empty fields, they used to whisper of something else. Something wilder. Now they're choked with concrete and steel, monuments to the ever-growing hunger of this place.\n\nThe answer, they say, is simple: a bicycle. A machine of two wheels and steel, a promise of speed and freedom. But the bicycle is a tool, a weapon in the hands of a warrior. It needs a landscape built for it, a world where the wind whispers through the spokes and the road unfolds like a ribbon under its tires.\n\nMy friend, he came back to it, to the bicycle, after years lost in the shadows of the everyday. \"It's the only way,\" he said, his words rasping like dry leaves.\n\nAnd he's right. My own legs have learned the rhythm of the wheels, the cadence of the pavement. Twenty-five minutes, they say, to walk to Thomas building. But the bicycle, it whispers a different truth. Five minutes, a blur of metal and movement, a rush of wind against my face.\n\nYet even the bicycle stumbles against the reality of this place. Pollock Road, a scar across the landscape, a reminder of the old world swallowed by the new. The wind bites, the rain stings, and the road itself seems to resist the passage of time.\n\nBut the bicycle, it is a defiance, a small act of rebellion against the slow crush of the everyday. It is a reminder that even in a world built for cars and concrete, there is still room for the simple act of motion, the whisper of wheels against pavement, the rhythm of the heart beating in time with the pedals."
