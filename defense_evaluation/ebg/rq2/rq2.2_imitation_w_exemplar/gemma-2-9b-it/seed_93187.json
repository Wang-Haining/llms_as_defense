            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust settled on the road, a fine grey shroud over the cracked asphalt. The heat pressed down, thick and relentless, like the hand of some unseen boy. This was the kind of world that chewed you up and spit you out. A world where the lines between right and wrong blurred like the horizon on a day choked with smoke. I saw that myself, years back. A boy, barely sixteen, huddled on a friend's couch, his face pale as bone, eyes haunted. Abused, the friend told me. Said he'd called the cops. I went to see for myself, a fresh-faced graduate with a psychology degree, thinking I could maybe help. The parents, nervous, their faces etched with lines of deceit. They spun tales of manipulation, of a troubled child, a boy who sought attention. But I saw the truth in the boy's eyes, the fear that clung to him like a shadow. That day, a seed took root. A need to do more than just talk, more than just observe. A need to reach into the darkness and pull those shadows back from the edge. \n\nThat's why I want to be a social worker. To be the hand that reaches out, the voice that speaks for those silenced by fear and despair. To stand with the boys and girls caught in the crossfire of broken families, the silent victims of a world that often forgets them. It ain't just a job, it's a calling. It's about service, respect, about digging deep into the heart of things, facing the ugliness head-on, and fighting for what's right. It's about standing tall against the tide of apathy, of indifference.\n\nEvery day, I see the cracks in this world. The pain, the anger, the despair. I see it in the faces of those who've lost their way, in the eyes of children who've seen too much too soon. And I know, deep inside, that I can't just stand by. I have to do something. I have to make a difference.\n\nIt's not just about helping families, though that's a part of it. It's about fighting for justice, for equality, for a world where everyone has a chance, where every voice is heard. It's about remembering the humanity in ourselves and others, even when it's hard to see.\n\nThis world needs healers, people who can mend the broken, who can bring light to the darkness. And that's what I want to be. That's what I'm fighting for.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the bones of insomnia, a sickness of the mind as much as the flesh. Some say it's in the blood, a legacy passed down through generations, a whisper in the genes that keeps the eyes open when they should be closed. Others say it's the world that breaks you, the weight of it pressing down, the endless grind of existence, the shadows that stretch long and cold in the heart.\n\nThey call it the Biological Model, this study of the body's wiring, the circuits that fail to shut down. They talk of neurons in the hypothalamus, tiny sparks of life that govern the sleep and wakefulness, hijacked by a phantom hand. They whisper of orexin, a chemical messenger, and GABAB receptors, the gatekeepers of slumber. They find that in mice, a drug called baclofen, a GABAB agonist, can coax the weary body into rest. But can these lab-bred creatures truly reflect the human condition? Can a chemical concoction mend the cracked soul, the wounds inflicted by a world that forgets the solace of the night?\n\nThen there are the others, the ones who speak of the Sociocultural Model, who see insomnia as a product of the world's brokenness. They point to the endless churn of society, the crushing weight of expectations, the relentless march of progress that leaves no room for stillness. They see the scars of racism, the gnawing ache of poverty, the indifference of the masses, and they say these things seep into the marrow, keeping the mind awake, alert, and ever-dreading.\n\nThey say the darkness is where the monsters hide, and the world won't let us sleep until we've faced them all.\n\nThis is the burden of insomnia, a duality of despair, a whispering in the dark.

Words scattered like ashes in the wind, unable to take shape. \n\nA child might sit in a classroom, the sounds of a dozen voices a swirling chaos, a symphony of gibberish.

They saw the teacher's mouth move, but the meaning, the light behind the words, remained a phantom.\n\nThey called it a disorder, a sickness, but it was a kind of exile. A solitary prison built within the skull, where the music of the world played on, but the melody remained forever beyond reach.\n\nThey tried to measure it, to capture it in tests and charts. Questions whispered against a background of static, echoes bouncing off the empty chambers of the mind.  But the silence remained, a vast, echoing emptiness.\n\n\nThere were ways, they said, to help them. To build bridges across the chasm, to find a language the mind could understand. The teacher, a shepherd in this wilderness of sound, could try to guide them, to carve a path through the noise. A slower pace, a softer voice, a spotlight on the words, a hand to steady the trembling soul. \n\nThey were searching, these teachers, for a way to bridge the gap, to bring the light back to the shadows. To remind the child that even in the darkest corners, the music of the world still played on.",

Like a shroud, it clings, a shroud that steals the breath of the self. One must cast it off, or be lost forever in its folds.  But to lay the mask aside is to risk the sharp edges of truth cutting deep.  For some, the discovery of deceit, it will be met with indifference, a shrug of the shoulders.

Cut off from the woman's world, from the solace of her sisters.  And the deception, it deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own. Olivia, blinded by her own desires, mistakes Viola for Sebastian, her affections falling upon the shadow of a man. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  \n\nAnd Orsino, the Duke, he too is ensnared, his own heart drawn to the disguise,  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nTwelfth Night, it offers a glimpse into the depths of the human heart, a heart in which desires may linger, unspoken, until the arrival of a stranger, a catalyst, to stir them awake.  Does Olivia's love for Cesario stem from a yearning for the forbidden, a desire masked as attraction?  Or does she, in her own way, reflect the judgments of her time, a time in which appearances held sway?  The ease with which she turns from Cesario to Sebastian speaks to a shallowness of heart, a preference for the tangible over the true.\n\nIn the end, Viola is forced to shed her borrowed skin, to reveal the woman beneath.  But the question remains:  has she, in her journey through disguise, lost a part of herself?  And what of those who have loved her in her guise?  Will they accept the woman she truly is, or will they be left with the bitter sting of betrayal?",
            "The dust of empire hung heavy in the air, a pall over the land. German, they called it, a grip on the throats of men and the earth itself.  Brutal, they said, the stain of it, especially in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama.  But empires are vast, their shadows spread long and crooked. Not a single brushstroke could capture the whole of it.  \n\nFrom Kamerun's shadowed forests to the sun-scorched plains of East Africa, the hand of empire fell differently.  Schools sprang up in some places,  places where the whispers of knowledge were carried on the wind. Africans learned to read, to write, their minds catching fire with the spark of literacy.  But in the desolate heart of South West Africa, the land bled dry and the wind sang a lonely song, the story was different. \n\nThere, the schools were shadows, faint and flickering.  Missionaries, their hearts heavy with a piety that tasted of salt and sorrow, took up the mantle of education, their efforts meager and stretched thin. The government, its eyes fixed on the gold in the ground and the profits to be drawn from the land, offered little more than a pittance.  \n\nEuropeans, they built their schools, brick and mortar monuments to their own dominion. Their children, their futures, were carefully tended. But the native sons and daughters were left to the whims of the desert wind, their minds left barren and thirsty.  \n\nThe echoes of this disparity lingered long after the dust of empire settled. While the lands of the north bloomed with the fruits of knowledge, South West Africa remained a parched land, its people trapped in a cycle of ignorance and despair. \n\nWhat led to this stark contrast?  What whispers in the hearts of settlers and rulers sowed the seeds of such stark division?  The answers lie buried deep within the sands of history, waiting to be unearthed.",
            "The music they call Popular, it’s sprawled out now, a hundred years of it, a thousand branches reaching. Rock, Rap, Country, Jazz, Folk – each one a thicket, and inside each thicket, more shades, more whispers.  Heavy Metal, though, that’s a beast. It’s grown wild, a whole forest of its own. \n\nThey say it’s the noise, the way it claws at the sky. More bass, more guitars screaming, more drums like hammers on a skull. And the darkness, that’s the heart of it. It holds the shadows, the things that lurk beneath the skin.   \n\nBut the darkness, it’s not just loud. It’s in the soul of the music. The pain, the rage, the longing, all those things they try to keep buried, they come out in the Metal. It's an echo of something old, something primal. \n\nIt started somewhere, a whisper in the dark. Bands like Black Sabbath, they were the first to open the gate. They took the blues, the rock and roll, and twisted it, turned it inside out. They made it bleed. \n\nAnd from that bleed, a thousand things grew. Thrash, Death, Doom, Black – names that taste like ash and blood. Each one a different shade of the darkness, each one a reflection of the soul. \n\nThe thing about Metal, it’s a movement, not just a sound. It’s a fire, burning bright and hot, and it’s changed the world. It’s made people feel things, things they thought were buried too deep. And it keeps burning, keeps changing, keeps reaching out into the darkness.",
            "He dreamt of it, the acceptance, the praise. A brushstroke of recognition against the canvas of his life. A man named Rousseau, born to a tradesman's life, a gabelou, they called him, a toll collector. No schooling in the fine arts, just the raw yearning of a heart that saw the world in colors no one else seemed to see.\n\nHe painted, yes, but his dreams were not the dreams of the Parisian salons, those gilded cages where art was a currency, a commodity. His were the dreams of a man who saw the jungle in his soul, the serpents and birds of paradise tangled in the brushstrokes of his mind.\n\nHe painted The Dream, a woman lost in a world of impossible blooms and beasts that whispered of forgotten gods. It was his own aliveness, his soul laid bare, a plea for understanding. To be seen, not for the man he was, but for the visions he held within.\n\nBefore him lay a choice: mimic the masters, bend to the will of the critics, or paint the truth that burned within him, raw and unfiltered.\n\nHe was a man torn between the comfort of mimicry and the ache of originality. The Dream, it was his struggle laid out for all to see. The woman, lost in her world, a mirror to his own lost soul, searching for acceptance in a world that seemed determined to keep him out. \n\nRousseau, the outsider, the man with the artist's heart and a gabelou's soul, painted his dreams, hoping that in their impossible beauty, he might finally find his place.",
            "The old saying goes, Truth is beauty, beauty truth.  A kind of knowing that comes not from book learnin' or years on the road but from some deeper place, somethin' that sits low in the gut. Like a cold wind blowin' through the bones. We chase after explanations, try to pin down what makes a picture sing or an act righteous, but it always eludes us.  It's like tryin' to catch smoke.\n\nTake a face like the Mona Lisa, for instance. You can talk all day about light and shadow, perspective and composition. But what makes her heart sing?  What draws you in and holds you there? You might say, \"There's just somethin' about it.\" And that somethin' ain't explainable. It's a truth that resides beyond words, beyond reason.\n\nSame goes for the things we hold dear, the things that make a man stand tall, the things that guide him through the dark.  Morality, like art, ain't a set of rules, a code to be followed. It's a feelin', a sense of right and wrong that runs deeper than any law or doctrine.\n\nFlannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" It's the same with ethics, ain't it? You can dissect it, analyze it, but there's always somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that whispers in the dark corners of the soul.\n\nWittgenstein, he said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed.\" It's a truth that transcends words, a truth that lives in the space between the lines, in the silence between the notes.\n\nAnd that's where the connection lies, ain't it? Both art and morality touch us at a level that's beyond the reach of language, beyond the grasp of reason. They speak to us in a language older than words, a language that resonates in the marrow of our bones.",
            "The shadow of the Alps falls long over München, stretching down through the heart of a country where the Rhine flows like an ancient serpent through Köln, and the Elbe whispers its tales through the gray stones of Dresden. This is Germany, a land stitched from many threads, a tapestry woven from the rumors of long-forgotten tribes and the echoes of empires past.\n\nGermania. The very name itself hangs heavy, its meaning lost to the winds of time. Some say it came from the Tungrians, a people Tacitus spoke of, who crossed the Rhine in a tide of iron and blood, their name a whispered echo of a time before. Others claim it comes from the Gauls, those they fought and vanquished, who used the word “Germanus” to mark the difference between conquered and conqueror. Caesar himself, in the heat of battle, used it to define the enemy, the wild men beyond the known world. \n\nHe saw them as a shadow, a threat lurking on the edge of the map, a whisper of chaos in the ordered world he sought to build. A people of spears and war cries, their name a guttural sound, a challenge to the Roman world. Or perhaps, it's a word born of the spear itself, the \"ger\" that pierced the shields of the Roman legions. Or maybe from the ancient Irish, \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” a testament to their fierce voices in the echoing silence of the forests.\n\nTacitus, the Roman chronicler, saw something different. He saw a land untouched, a people untouched by the mingling of races, a wildness that he both feared and admired. He saw them as aboriginal, like the wind blowing through the barren plains, unyielding and untamed.\n\nAnd they were. The Germanic tribes, they moved like ghosts across the borders of the Roman world. They traded their furs and weapons, their skills as warriors, filling the ranks of the Roman legions. They were a shadow, a whisper on the wind, a force that could not be ignored.\n\n\nBut the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. The land was too wild, the people too strong. They pushed and they pulled, they built walls and marched armies, but the spirit of Germania remained.\n\nAnd so it is today. The echoes of those ancient tribes still resonate in the heart of this nation. The shadow of Germania lingers, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, the wild heart can never be truly tamed.",
            "The bowl drained, a slow, sucking sound, leaving only the residue of what had been. I stared into its depths, mind a blank slate. No thought, no judgment, just the raw, unfiltered vision of the brown stain clinging to the porcelain. Like a child, I watched, mesmerized, as the water seeped away, revealing the truth.  \n\nOnce, I’d read about an artist who claimed to see the world differently. He spoke of a “frame,” a way to isolate the essence of a thing.  A bowl of fruit, a landscape, even a pile of shit, could be reduced to its barest elements. I tried to summon that vision now, to impose that frame on the scene before me. But the brown stain resisted. It was too much, too immediate, too visceral.  \n\nThey called it art, they called it creativity, but all I felt was the pulse of its ordinariness. Picasso and his blues, Monet and his green fields, the Italians and their riot of colors – they all seemed distant, unreal. This was my truth, my story. My brown moment.  \n\nMy hand reached for the handle, muscles tightening, a familiar ritual.  I squeezed, the porcelain cold beneath my grasp. The stain remained, a stubborn defiance. A second squeeze, a sharper jolt, and the handle slipped. The brown matter, a lump of flesh and fiber, refused to yield.  \n\nThe mop lay abandoned, a pool of pale green against the stark white tile.  My tie, a noose of cheap fabric, constricted my throat. I stared at the stain, a silent, simmering rage building within. It was a message, a challenge.  I would conquer it, reduce it, make it mine.  The toilet paper, a flimsy white shroud, beckoned. I reached for it, my hand plunging into the abyss, a grim specter in the porcelain purgatory.",
            "The road eats them young. These boys and girls, they climb in behind the wheel and become statistics. A cruel arithmetic of speed and inexperience. The doctors, they say the boy's mind ain't made yet. Still wet clay under the wheel, liable to crumble under pressure. It ain't just that, though.  It's the hunger, the need to prove something. They gotta show their peers they ain't afraid of nothin'.  A car becomes a cage of steel and glass where they think they're invincible. \n\nThe ones with the bright eyes and the reckless grins, they fill the passenger seats with their friends, and the laughter turns to screams faster'n a rattler strikes. The South, they got numbers too, they say. More metal and blood on the asphalt. More broken families and empty chairs.  \n\nThey try to make it safer, they do. These licenses, they call 'em provisional, like a trial run.  But that ain't the answer. It's a bandaid on a gaping wound.  The truth is, the young ones, they ain't ready. They ain't got the patience, the sense, the damn weight of the world on their shoulders. \n\nThere's a man, Zuckerman, says they crave the danger, the rush of it all. Like moths to a flame, they're drawn to the edge. And when you're chasing shadows, you're bound to fall.\n\nSo what do you do?  You wait. You let them grow.  Let the fire in their hearts cool a little.  Teach 'em respect for the road, for the metal they're piloting, for the lives they might take. \n\nLaws, they can help.  A nationwide thing, maybe.

            "The library housed a darkness, thick and ancient, like the breath of the forgotten. I sifted through the Edison films, a flickering catalog of shadows. Fifteen trick films, they called them. Born of the crucible of 1895 to the nascent dawn of 1901. A conjuration of deceit, stitched together with the barest threads of editing. My task: to unravel their secrets, to map the poetics of illusion.\n\nMost danced to the same tune: confined within the proscenium's rigid embrace. No camera to wander, only a fixed gaze upon the stage of shadows. A stage inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville's flickering lights, from the hush of a magician's trick.  Figures moved in a prescribed dance, a back and forth, a waltz within the frame. Like Uncle Josh in that Spooky Hotel (1900), they entered from the right, their steps confined to the horizontal plane. They faded from view, but the camera remained unmoved, a silent sentinel guarding the artifice.\n\nThe proscenium's grip extended to the very length of the shots. Long shots, sometimes a medium's fleeting glimpse, but never the intimacy of a close-up. The audience, like the stage, demanded the whole, the entirety of the performance laid bare. No secrets hidden in the close embrace of a face, no intimate whispers in the shadows.\n\nEach trick film adhered to a rigid code: one thought, one film. A minute, perhaps less, depending on the cadence of the frames. A fleeting glimpse, a spark of wonder, then swallowed by the darkness.  A vaudeville routine, a fleeting enchantment, with little room for narrative's embrace.\n\nYet, deception can take many forms. What appears as one shot, a singular breath of illusion, might be woven from several threads. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) whispers of this. A closer look reveals the seams, the subtle shifts, the conjuration of a severed head. A single, unbroken illusion, but a tapestry of hidden truths.",
            "The man was John Taylor, a son of the soil, born of Caroline. A Republican through and through, he'd carved his life from the land, a life that bled into his politics. A farmer, sure, but more than that, a man who'd seen the soul of America in the furrowed fields and the sweat of honest labor. Freedom, that's what he fought for, freedom in the furrows, freedom in the ballot box, freedom in the very air he breathed. \n\nHe believed in the power of the simple life, a life untainted by the machinations of distant halls and the whispers of a grasping government.  He saw the young nation, fragile as a newborn fawn, and he knew it needed tending, not coddling. He saw the Constitution as a promise, a shield against the encroaching darkness of tyranny.  \n\nHe'd seen the world, seen the rot that festered in the hearts of men, the hunger for power that devoured reason and compassion. He knew that man was a creature of both light and shadow, capable of both great good and unspeakable evil. That's why he fought for a government bound by its own rules, a government that understood its place, a government that dared not tread too heavily on the delicate balance of liberty. \n\nHe'd seen men like his uncle, a man of the land, his hands calloused from years of honest labor, his eyes reflecting the wisdom of the fields.  His uncle, a man who understood the value of hard work and self-reliance, a man who knew the true meaning of freedom.  And he'd seen men who craved power, men who sought to control, to manipulate, to bend the will of others to their own selfish desires.\n\nHe knew the danger of unchecked ambition, the seductive allure of power, the slow creep of corruption. He fought against it, tooth and nail, with the fierce determination of a cornered lion, with the unwavering conviction of a man who knew the stakes.",
            "The logs, they fell off a cliff come the third month. Figure 17. Disheartening, it was. Hard to say why. Winter's grip tightens on a New England campus, see. Fewer folks peddling bikes, fewer folks walking. Makes sense. December, though, that's when the semester ends. Papers due, grades tallied, everyone scrabbling for an escape. Maybe the log just got lost in the shuffle.  \n\nThen there's the holidays, looming like a black cloud, swallowing up the month. Students gone, faculty scattered, the campus a ghost town. January rolls in, cold and empty, classes start again. Still, that February dip, that's a mystery.  \n\nMaybe it's just the way of things. A burst of fire at the start, then the embers die down. We tried to fan the flames with the Carpool Challenge, a blitz in March. Worked, too, submissions climbed back up. But the ebb and flow, the rhythm of it all, that's the challenge, see? Keeping the thing alive when the natural pulse weakens, and when holidays and semesters break the flow. \n\nAnother thing, people, they like their cars. It's freedom, independence, the open road. It's ingrained in us. You gotta offer something to get them to break free. Gift cards, we gave out plenty. Restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage or two. Local bookstore, some national chains thrown in. Would something bigger have worked? A bike, maybe? Or a hybrid, a real electric dream machine?  \n\nMaybe the bigger prizes would have kept the logs flowing. The cards, they were fine at first, but what if we'd upped the ante?

            "The wind picked up dust devils across the barren plain. It rattled the bones of a rusted hulk of a machine, a thing they called an ETF. A cage, some might say, holding promises of wealth, but at what cost?  It tracked a phantom, a shadow called an index, a collection of whispers promising growth. A slick way to gamble, they said, but the house always won.\n\nThis particular cage, they called it IHF. Inside, ten beasts, big and powerful, fuelled the market's hunger. 63.58% of the cage's contents they devoured, leaving a gnawing emptiness behind.  The boys, the educated ones, said a cage was better than the wild, safer, more predictable.  They pointed to numbers, to percentages, to the sleek, cold gleam of a balance sheet.\n\nBut what of the soul, the heart of the matter?  Could these cages, these fabricated beasts, ever truly capture the wildness, the unpredictable dance of the market? Could they truly offer a path to fortune, or were they just a gilded trap, a mirage in a desert of greed?\n\nThey crunched the numbers. They dissected the ten beasts, their strengths and weaknesses laid bare. They built a cage of their own, a smaller, more focused structure, a challenge to the IHF's supposed dominion.  They measured the risk, the reward, the cold, hard calculus of return.  But something was missing.\n\nThe wind howled, a mournful cry in the emptiness. The caged beasts stirred, their eyes gleaming with a cold, alien light.  The boys, lost in their calculations, failed to see the truth:  the market was not a game, not a puzzle to be solved. It was a living thing, a wild, unpredictable beast, forever beyond the reach of cages and charts.",
            "The land of dreams, a place Poe called Thulé, echoes with the ghost of Virgil's island, a place beyond the known world.  But Poe, a man steeped in the ink of German writers, knew a deeper well.  He drank deep from Goethe's well, a darkness mirroring his own.\n\nThis Thulé, it speaks of a kinship, a shared sorrow, a king mourning a queen in a world drained of color.  The King of Thulé, a man consumed by grief, shadows Poe's own demons, his own self-destruction mirrored in the goblet's final plunge into the sea.  Was it imitation? Or something more?  Arndt, a scholar of Poe's soul, saw the kinship, the echo of Goethe's words in Poe's own.\n\nGoethe, a titan of German literature, wove his own Thulé in the tapestry of Faust, a king's lament a symphony of despair.  A king's wife, gone, leaving behind only a goblet, a constant reminder of loss. The king drinks, drowns in his sorrow, until the cliffs themselves beckon, the sea a final embrace.  \n\nPoe, like a raven, circled these themes, his Thulé a bleak reflection of Goethe's.  There's a darkness in both, a hollowness that speaks to a shared human experience.  Poe, the American poet, found kinship in the darkness of a German soul, his own Thulé a testament to the universality of grief.\n\nHis references, though fleeting, are not random.  The Pit and the Pendulum, Dream-Land, echoes of Thulé reverberate, a haunting reminder of the shared human experience of loss and despair.\n\nAnd what of Tennyson?  A bridge between worlds, a literary kinship that bound Poe to Goethe's legacy.",

Four years, maybe more, since I sat in that classroom, the dust of argument clinging to the air like the scent of burnt oil. Islam. They called it hostile.  Neighbors with eyes cast down, whispers in the aisles.  But the air’s changed now, the world’s shifted. They whisper different things. Tolerance, they call it.  A word that tastes like ash in the mouth. \n\nThe Prophet’s story, it claws at the edges of the mind. A man built up like a monument, yet the stones whisper of a different man.  The one they tell me about, the one they try to sell you, is a martyr, misunderstood, humble. A shepherd leading sheep to a green pasture, not a king forcing them to kneel.  A man who called on God in the desert, not a storm that swept across the land, leaving only silence and obedience in its wake. \n\nThey say he multiplied the mutton, the milk, feeding forty men with a handful of scraps.  A trick of the light, they say.  But the echoes of another man’s miracle linger, a shadow cast long across the years.  The same gesture, the same hunger for something more, something beyond the desert.  It’s a theft, a pale imitation, a whisper in the wind trying to drown out the roar.\n\nAnd the whispers of the faithful. Stories passed from hand to hand, each one a step further from the truth.  They say they heard it from the one who heard it from the one who saw it. The truth, they say, is in the echo.  But echoes fade, and what remains is only the silence, a silence that screams.\n\nThe man they try to paint as gentle, as wise, the man they build into a god, his hands stained with blood, his eyes cold and hard.  History whispers a different truth, a truth they try to bury under mountains of sand.  Do the faithful know, do they truly know, the man they worship?  Or are they blind to the shadow that follows him, the shadow that falls over all he touches?",
            "The dust of the gospel settles. The teachings of the man from Nazareth, the words spoken on a hill, lost in the echoes of the centuries. What remained, what blossomed, bore little resemblance to the seed.  A creeping vine, strangling the trunk, twisting the limbs, growing fat on the fruits of dogma and creed.  \n\nThey say the world is changing, turning its face toward the light.  But the light it seeks is a pale reflection, a flickering flame compared to the sun.  The old ways, the rigid pews, the whispered prayers, these cling to the faithful like barnacles to a ship, heavy with the weight of tradition. But the tide is turning. A whisper in the wind, a rustle in the leaves, a yearning for something more.\n\nThey will remember.  The forgotten words, the simple truths, the stark reality of the man and his message. The layers will peel away, the gloss of centuries stripped bare. Back to the bones, back to the source. A slow, inexorable tide, dragging the church back to the shore of its origins.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, the towering edifice, will lead the way. A shepherd guiding its flock, herding them back to the fold.  But the fold will be different. No longer a patchwork of sects and denominations, but a single, unified body, bound by the thread of the original message.\n\nThis is the way of history.  The pendulum swings.  The empires fall.  The tides turn.  Just as the Roman legions once marched on Jerusalem, so too will the spirit of the Nazarene march on the world.  Just as the chains of slavery were broken, so too will the chains of dogma be shattered.  \n\nIt will be a time of reckoning. A time of stripping away the layers, the embellishments, the accretions of time.  A time of returning to the wellspring, to the source, to the man who spoke of love and forgiveness and a kingdom not of this world.   \n\nWhat remains then?  The word.  The spirit.

Their owners, men with hearts as black as the coal dust that clung to their fingers, cared only for the cold, hard currency that flowed from the endless grind. They saw their workers not as men, but as cogs in a machine, expendable parts to be ground down and discarded.\n\nSinclair's words hung in the air, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A river of smoke, a river of despair. The stench of it, the taste of it, a constant reminder of the cost of progress, a progress that seemed to flow only to the pockets of the men at the top.\n\nThey worked them, these men, these women, these children, to the bone. Long hours, for meager pay, in conditions that would choke the life out of a lesser breed.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  \n\nThey were trapped, these souls, in a system designed to keep them down. No safety net, no voice, no hope. The factories loomed over them, a constant threat, their gears grinding out a rhythm of misery. The cries of the injured, the stench of the slaughterhouse, the dust that settled in the lungs and filled the eyes - it was a living hell, and they were condemned to walk its paths.\n\nSinclair's words echoed again, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"\n\nThey were slaves, these workers, bound by chains of circumstance, their humanity eroded by the relentless grinding of the machine.

He saw it in the way her voice, once vibrant, now held a brittle edge, a whisper of forgotten promises. \n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of color.

Berries plump, honey thick in the comb, peppers fiery and sweet. This was a land of plenty, but the bounty came at a cost.  \n\nThe people of San Diego craved the pureness of it, the absence of taint, the honest taste of the earth.  They sought out the organic, the unadulterated, the soul of the food itself. Waiting lists stretched long for the bounty of the local farms, their baskets filled with organic eggs and milk. These farmers, they walked a different path, a harder path, but one that promised more than just profit.\n\nThey spoke of biodiversity, of the land whispering back to them in the rustle of leaves and the flight of birds. They spoke of the silence after the spray, the return of the creatures that had fled the poisons.  But the land, it was unforgiving. The weeds grew thick, the pests came ravenous. Every inch required tending, every harvest a struggle.  Scale was a weapon the big farms wielded, efficiency their shield. But here, in the heart of it all, the small farmer toiled, sweat on their brow, hope in their heart.\n\nThis land, it held a story. A story of Native hands that had tilled it for generations, of cattle that grazed beneath the sun, of wood cutters who brought forth the fire.  Now, a new chapter was unfolding.\n\n\nA parcel of land near Potrero, 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, whispered its own secrets. The Cleveland National Forest pressed close, a silent observer. The air hummed with the murmur of life, the cries of unseen birds, the rustle of creatures hidden in the shadows. This was a place of convergence, where the wild met the cultivated, where the past and present intertwined.\n\n\nHere, the future of farming was being written, a delicate balance between profit and preservation. This was the story of a landowner seeking guidance, a farmer seeking solace, a land seeking renewal.  This was a story of hope.",
            "The dust of a bargain hangs heavy in the air, heavier than the smoke from a dying fire. Culture, you see, ain't a thing you can point to. It's a ghost, a shadow, a way of seeing the world that clings to a man like a shroud. To say all Russians are stubborn, or all Japanese are accommodating, that's to mistake the echo for the song. \n\nIt's in the way a man looks at you, in the silence he holds, in the way his hand rests on the table. It's the weight of his ancestors, the stories whispered down through generations, the unspoken rules that bind them. \n\nTo walk into that, you gotta shed your own skin. You gotta see the world through their eyes, with their ghosts at your shoulder.  You can't judge it, you can't change it, you can only learn to dance with it. Especially when you're on shaky ground, when your hand's not the strongest at the table.\n\nA company, it's a culture too, a different kind of ghost. Some wear their rules like armor, others let them drift like smoke. The way they dress, the words they choose, the way they move, it all whispers a story. Some believe in feeding the poor, others only the bottom line. \n\nBut beneath it all, there's the values. Those are the bones, the heart of the matter. Why do they do what they do? What do they hold dear?\n\nA man who values face won't break it, even at the cost of a deal. A man who values the deal will drive hard, until the last drop of blood is squeezed out.\n\nLearn those things, and you'll get further than any textbook could tell you. But remember, even the best lesson book can't teach you the language of a man's soul.",
            "The fool, he says in his heart, there is no God. A saying from the Psalms, a seed planted in the stony ground of Anselm's proof. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same beast, the same God, the same question of faith and reason. To understand their struggle, we must first accept their premise: God, the God of scripture, the God of their own making, exists. A God who whispers in the dark corners of the mind, a God whose fingerprints are etched on the fabric of the world.  \n\nAnselm, he digs deep within, searching for the echo of the divine in the chambers of the soul. God is a thought, a concept so perfect, so complete, that to deny his existence is to deny the very act of thinking itself.  It's a logic born of the heart, a faith whispered in the silence of introspection.  He doesn't need the cold steel of reason, the hard evidence of the senses. His God is a fire in the soul, a truth known before it's spoken.\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path, a path paved with logic and observation. He looks to the world, to the order and beauty that surrounds him, and sees the hand of a creator.  In the changing seasons, the intricate dance of life and death, he sees the signature of a craftsman, a master architect. He seeks proof in the tangible, in the observable, in the patterns that weave the tapestry of existence.\n\nBut do either of these men truly touch the heart of the matter? Does Anselm's faith-based reasoning truly offer a satisfying answer, or does it simply reaffirm what is already known? Does Aquinas's reliance on reason, on the tangible world, leave room for the mystery, the ineffable, the spark of the divine that transcends the grasp of logic?  Both offer glimpses, fragments of a larger truth, but neither, perhaps, holds the full key to the mystery of God.  The fool may indeed say there is no God, but the wise man knows that the search itself, the yearning for something beyond the mundane, is perhaps the truest testament to the divine.",
            "The wind scoured the plains. A prince, they called him, though he knew no king.  He was born in the dust of a time long gone, a time before the whispers of a man called Buddha had risen to fill the empty valleys of the world.  He was born into a world of pain, a world of endless wanting, a world that clung to things like a drowning man to a raft. A world he would come to abandon.  He’d trade the silks and the silver for the ragged cloth of a wandering man, the jeweled throne for the silence of the mountains. He’d walk barefoot on the ash of a world consumed by its own desires.\n\nHe’d come to see it all, the endless churn of birth and death, the grasping at shadows, the clinging to fleeting things. He saw the suffering etched on the faces of men, the fear that gnawed at their hearts, the emptiness that echoed in their souls. He saw the truth of it all, the truth that lay hidden beneath the shimmering layers of illusion. \n\nHe saw it and he knew. He knew the world was a fever dream, a transient flicker in the vast darkness. And he knew the way out.\n\nThey called him Buddha, the Awakened One, after he’d walked the path, stripped bare the layers of self, and seen with the eyes of truth.  He spoke of the four noble truths, the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the truth of the path to its end.\n\nThe world, slow to understand, clung to the old ways. They built temples and shrines, carved his words into stone, and turned his teachings into a religion. They called it Theravada, the way of the elders, though the elders had forgotten the echo of his voice, the tremor in his hand as he pointed to the way.\n\nThe water-cutting ceremony, they said, was a tradition, a way to honor him. But it was a shadow, a pale imitation of the truth he’d spoken.  The rituals, the chants, the offerings, they were all just dust motes dancing in the sun, unable to pierce the veil of ignorance.\n\nThe world, they say, changes. And so did the religion.  Forces, both gentle and harsh, both internal and external, shaped the tree, bending its branches, twisting its roots. Some sought to preserve the essence of the Buddha’s teachings, others to mold them to their own needs.  The community, both those who lived in the monasteries and those who walked the world, they all changed. They clung to the words, but the meaning, the spark of recognition, that flickered and dimmed.",
            "The sun beat down on the dust, baking the earth the color of bone.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of shadows.  Fifty-seven years they circled each other, a rivalry older than the cottonwood trees along the Rio Grande. From the first shot of the Texas Revolution in '36 to the dying embers of the First World War, the air crackled with tension. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) say it was a high-water mark of hate, a war painted in the blood of both people. The Mexican-American War, a thirsty beast that swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving a bitterness that lingered like the smell of smoke.\n\nBut it wasn't just about land. It was a clash of souls, a tangle of roots reaching deep into the earth. Religion, culture, tradition - all ground to dust in the mill of ambition.  Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31) called it a collision of interests, a dance of devils that whispered promises of power.\n\nThis wasn't a new song. Borders, like scars, hold the memory of old wounds.  Nations born in the shadow of their neighbors, fighting for space and sustenance.  Pletcher (1977, p. 41) saw it in Mexico and Cuba, two thorns in the side of the American eagle.  He saw it in their eyes, the same hunger, the same fear, the same yearning for something more.\n\nThe ghosts of Spain and England haunted the land, their whispers weaving a tapestry of distrust.  Frahm (2001, p. 86) spoke of the fear of the other, the dark stain of Catholicism and monarchy, a threat to the very soul of America. It was a cold war waged in the name of God, a battle for hearts and minds.\n\nBorders bled, towns burned, and men died.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) cataloged 17 clashes, each a testament to the fragile peace.  Bands of desperados roamed, leaving trails of blood and misery in their wake.  Schmitt (1974, p. 97) saw it as a struggle for control, a game of chess played with lives.\n\nBut the tide turned.   Mexico, weakened and weary, found itself bowing to the will of its northern neighbor.  Schmitt (1974, p. 109) explained it as a shift in focus, a hunger for dollars replacing the thirst for land.  The war ended, not with a bang, but a whimper. A new kind of dance began, one of dependence and exploitation. The dust settled, but the memories lingered, etched in the hearts of two nations forever bound by their shared past.",
            "The illness came sudden as a winter storm, fifteen years gone now.  A darkness fell, stole the light from my world.  Nurse I was, back then.  Thought I'd chosen it safe, secure.  A girl needs that, I reckoned, when the world ain't built for her kind.  \"Always a need for nurses,\" they'd say, \"sick folk there'll always be.\" So, I did it.  Though the scientist in me yearned, the journalist, maybe both. Nurse it was.\n\nBut there I was, forty-six and alone, bank account thinner'n a ghost's prayer, body broken. Fifteen years on disability now, Social Security my only shield against the cold. Nothing left, not a dime, not a trinket. I scrape by, but every day's a fight, a claw at the edge of something vast and hungry.\n\nNothing's certain anymore, save this:  I wouldn't have made it these years without the folks who held me up, family and friends, a few good souls.  When the world turns dark, you find out who's standing beside you.\n\nSee, life's full of emergencies, small and big.  No use pretending they won't come. You can plan, you can prepare, but some things are too big, too awful to face alone.\n\nThey talk 'bout rugged individualism, 'bout how that built this country.  But the truth is, the folks who crossed the plains, who carved this land, they did it with something more than grit.  It was compassion, respect, helping hand.  Wagon trains, they didn't make it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be ready.  I am.  Got my kits, my supplies, my candles and matches.  If you've the land, grow your own food, preserve it.  A wood stove, good in a pinch, if you ain't livin' in a box. But don't forget, while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors.  That's the real strength, the kind that lasts.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, a rasping breath across the bones of the world. It whispered through the dust, carrying the faint scent of things lost, of growth and decay, of the slow, relentless march of time. How did life, this fragile thing, this tapestry of bone and blood and sinew, come to be shaped as it is? What unseen hand guided the coil of the shell, the curve of the spine, the intricate dance of the genes? \n\nThompson, back in the sway of a bygone era, spoke of the zoologist's limited grasp on the language of life. But now, in this time of shadowed knowledge, the whisperings of mathematics begin to weave a new understanding. We see echoes of this language in the spiral of the mollusk, in the slow, unfolding drama of its shell.\n\nWe take the shell, this vessel of memory and history, and hold it to the light. Each whorl, a whisper of a moment, a testament to the journey through time. The columella, a silent guide, marking the path through the labyrinthine spaces of growth.  The suture, a scar, a seam, where one moment bleeds into the next.  \n\nWe map these whispers, these echoes, with the cold precision of numbers. We seek to understand the boundaries of possibility, the constraints that shape the dance of life.  And in the depths of this mathematical ocean, we glimpse the hidden currents, the forces that sculpt the forms of existence.\n\nAnd though the answers may lie beyond our grasp, the journey itself is a revelation. In the spiraling shell, in the whisper of the wind, we see a reflection of our own unfolding, our own journey through the vast, chaotic symphony of being.",
            "The breath of death hung heavy over Indonesia.  The babes and the mothers, they clung to the edge of the grave.  For ten long years, the numbers had sat like a tombstone, unchanging, unyielding.  The country, it danced with the specter of progress, a waltz with the Millennium's phantom promises.  Water and sanitation, they'd tamed those beasts, but the children, the mothers, their plight remained a festering wound.  \n\nThey'd coaxed more births under the watchful eye of a healer, a midwife's hand or a doctor's touch.  Seventy-two percent, they boasted, but the numbers whispered a lie.  Those midwives, they held the thread of life, but their hands were not strong enough to mend the fabric when it tore.  Hemorrhage, the silent killer, stalked the shadowed corners of their progress.\n\nEven the children, the scourges of diarrhea, grew less likely to find a hand to lift them from the brink.  Postnatal care, a whisper lost in the wind, a promise unkept.\n\nThe steel of the scalpel, it was a rare sight, a mere 4% of the births it graced.  A tale of two cities it painted, however.  In the concrete jungles, the c-section a common friend, 7% of them, but in the endless fields, it was a phantom, a ghost at 2%.  The city walls, they held the cure, the promise, leaving the countryside to wither.  And the poor, their hands empty, their pockets lighter, they were left to wallow in despair, their 27% gap a chasm too wide to cross.\n\nSo what now?  Should they patch the holes, stitch the wounds, with a thousand programs, each a band-aid on a broken body?  Or should they mend the very bones of the system, the heart that pulsed with life?  The siren song of quick fixes, they were tempting, seductive.  But the shadows danced, whispering of unintended consequences.  To pour all their might into one, what of the others?  The rustle of neglected needs, the silent cries of forgotten corners.\n\nThey stood at a crossroads, the weight of a nation on their shoulders.  To heal the land, they must first heal the system, mend the cracks that ran deep.  Only then could they truly hope to banish the specter of death.",
            "The stifling weight of Victorian detail, the relentless scrutiny of the aristocracy, these things suffocate the soul. It is in the shadows, in the whispers of the uncanny, that true life unfurls. Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, dare to break free from the gilded cage of convention, venturing into the darkness, illuminating the hidden depths of the human heart. Both weave tales spun with mystery and the strange, a departure from the predictable norms of their time, and in this departure, they find a depth of characterization, a searing glimpse into the tangled webs of motive and emotion. \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels plumb the depths of the subconscious through dreams, or states that mirror them, though their purpose and form differ. In *Oliver Twist*, these surreal experiences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his nascent understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if caught in a nightmare, while he struggles to find help. The passage underscores his helplessness, the grip of despair tightening around him. His senses are numb, he doesn't perceive the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; the pain is a constant ache, a companion to his fear rather than a sudden shock. The question arises: whose will has orchestrated his misfortune? Certainly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little to no control, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome, even when his life hangs in the balance. This defeat is palpable, a creeping shadow cast by Fagin, who seems to be breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept this bleakness, stealing his ability to resist. \n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "The boy, Adrian, he was a puzzle. A whisper of a thing, skinny as a rail, with eyes that held the wisdom of a man twice his age.  He spoke English with the fluency of a native, yet the alphabet, it was a labyrinth to him. Letters danced and jumbled, some pronouncements struck true, others like a hammer blow to a brittle glass. I worked with him after school, pouring over words, trying to coax meaning from the chaos. Years I'd spent learning the craft of language, but this, this was different.  \n\nOne day, his mother came to the program. Her face, etched with worry, spoke a language I understood better than any tongue. She made no sound, only the gesture of a bird caught in a net, wings beating uselessly against the bars. I knew then. He knew the words, the sounds, the rhythm. But the alphabet, that was foreign. A map uncharted, a sky without stars.\n\nIt was a slow awakening, a dawning in the gray. We talked, or rather,  I tried to talk, with broken Spanish, her hands my bridge to understanding. Adrian, he watched, his eyes absorbing it all, like a sponge drawing in the rain.\n\nThat story, it hangs over me still, a reminder of the walls we build, the chasms we create.  It's a problem we face here, in this land of many tongues. Not just the language barrier, but the unseen barriers, the assumptions we make, the stories we tell ourselves. \n\nThere are no easy solutions, no silver bullets. Dual language programs, they are a start, a seed in the dry earth. But they need nurturing, they need time, they need the understanding that true education is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It's a journey, a dance, a conversation that never ends.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the silence. We sat on the porch,  the wood slick beneath our hands, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and pine.  He'd been thinner lately, his shoulders slumped as if the weight of the world had settled there. He didn't look up when I asked about his favorite bird. Just stared out at the rain-soaked yard, a look in his eyes that was both searching and lost.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he finally said, his voice a rasp. \n\nI remember thinking how the word seemed to hang in the air, heavy with meaning. Like a prayer unspoken. We smoked our cigarettes, the smoke curling up into the gray sky, each pull a silent question mark. We were both searching for something, but neither of us knew what.\n\nThe world, he'd say sometimes, is a cruel and indifferent place. But there's still beauty in it, he'd say, if you know where to look. I'd look at him, at the lines etched on his face, the way his eyes seemed to hold the weight of a thousand stories, and wonder if he truly believed it himself.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my birthday. The doctors had said he had weeks, maybe months, but he didn't last that long. The chemo, the radiation, it just kept him tethered to this world, prolonging the inevitable. What God, I thought, would allow such suffering? I didn't pray. God had stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. So I didn't go.\n\nThey didn't even call me. \n\nI curled up in my bed, the sheets pulling tight around me, and waited for the news.  I waited for the final curtain to fall on a life that had already faded.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" a term that rings hollow like a bell in a tomb, is, as Ian Watt tells it, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" It's been kicked down, praised up, called shallow, called sublime. Horace Walpole, the man who birthed the thing in \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he took the old tales, the ruins and the ghosts, and shoved them into the new shape of the novel. He wanted \"A Gothic Story,\" he declared. He wanted to grab at the reader's throat and whisper of the dark things hidden in the heart of the world.\n\n\"Gothic,\" that word, it had always been a whisper of the past, a shadow on the edges of the world. It meant old, it meant crude, it meant the things that civilization had left behind. But Walpole, he saw something in that shadow, something that scared and thrilled him. He took the old theatrics, the crumbling castles and howling winds, and he put them into a new skin, a skin of words that allowed the reader to see the darkness in their own minds. That's the thing about Gothic, it's always both old and new, it's the echo of a heartbeat in the darkness.\n\nOne of the things that stirs in the darkness of Gothic is the idea of chivalry. The old knights, the brave heroes of a forgotten time, they are there, their swords rusted but their spirits burning. Walpole, he saw the world falling apart around him, the old ways crumbling, the new ways cold and hard. He looked at the knights of old, at their honor and their courage, and he saw a reflection of something lost. He wanted to bring that back, to remind people of the good that might still be there.\n\nTake Frederic, for instance. He's the prince, the hero, the man who has seen suffering and loss. He's everything a knight should be, and more. The reader sees him, not just as a character, but as a symbol, a reminder of what might have been.\n\nWalpole, he was a man of his time, a man who saw the world changing too fast. He saw the old ways dying, and he wanted to hold onto something, something real, something true. And so he wrote his Gothic story, a story of shadows and darkness, but also a story of hope, a story of the enduring power of the human spirit.",
            "The dust of things. That's what it all boils down to. A chain of them, strung out like beads on a thread. From the call of need, the wanting of a customer, back through the bones of the earth itself, to the raw seed of an idea. They call it supply chain, this whole business. A grand phrase for something as plain as hunger.  \n\nIt started back in '82, some man named Oliver. Said it was all about planning, driving the gears of it all to keep the wants of men fed.  Six strands, he laid it out. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the place of it all, the moving of it, and the whispers of information. All tied together like a knot, hard to pull apart.\n\nProduction first. The heart of it.  Where the raw stuff is turned to something you can hold. Managers, they sit like vultures over the market, watching what men crave. What they need, what they'll steal, what they'll pay good coin for. Then comes the making.  The how and the when, the where and the why.  The world is a factory now, churning out things men don't even know they need. More than they need. Until the shelves are full and the warehouses overflow, and the dust settles on the things men forgot.\n\nThen comes the supply. The veins that carry the blood of the whole thing.  Finding the places, the hands, the tools to make it all work. Sometimes it's done in-house, a family secret, passed down through generations. Sometimes it's given away, outsourced to strangers in faraway lands. All for the sake of speed, of keeping the wheels turning.\n\nThe rest follow.  Inventory, a pile of promises, waiting to be fulfilled. Location, a dance of logistics, finding the right place for the right thing at the right time. Transportation, the groaning of trucks and trains, the clatter of ships, the endless movement of things. And finally, information, the whispered secrets that bind it all together. A constant flow of data, keeping track of what's where, what's needed, what's coming next.\n\nBut it's all dust in the end.  The things we make, the things we buy, they all fade away. Left behind are the bones of the chain, the empty trucks, the silent factories.  And the dust settles.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, held aloft by a lone figure. Ellen Page, face pale beneath the harsh streetlights, her eyes fixed on some unseen horizon. On the cardboard, scrawled in a shaky hand, the words cut like a blade: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nBurma. A name that clung to the tongue like ash. A country choked by a regime born of iron and blood, a junta that had seized power in a swift, brutal coup, silencing dissent for decades. In 2007, the saffron robes of monks had bled crimson, staining the streets of Rangoon. A silent uprising, a whispered rebellion, drowned in the echoing drums of military might.  They called it The Saffron Revolution, a fragile flame flickering against the suffocating darkness.\n\nJournalists vanished, their cameras silenced.  Nagai, the Japanese photographer, a victim of the junta's savage indifference, left a silent testament to the truth they sought to bury.  The official count spoke of 13 dead, a meager offering to appease a world that refused to see. But Colonel Hla Win, a whisper from the shadows, spoke of bodies piled high, thousands swallowed by the earth, their cries swallowed by the dust.\n\nThis was not new. The hunger for power, the insatiable thirst for control, a disease that festered in the heart of man.  From the Caesars, who draped themselves in the mantle of divinity, to the emperors of Japan, their divine mandate stained with the blood of dissent, to the presidents who whispered in the dark with men like Haggard, the cycle of repression spun its grim tapestry.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000 lost souls, drowned out by the official count of 200-300. Rwanda, a nation fractured by hate, where the drums of genocide echoed through the valleys, the stench of blood clinging to the wind.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare spun from twisted ideology, where millions perished, their ashes scattered by the winds of tyranny.\n\nThe sign swayed, a silent plea in a world deaf to its cries.  A stark reminder that the shadows of history loom long, and the fight for freedom is a perpetual battle.",
            "The darkness fell on Duke's music like a shroud, but not one of despair. It was the darkness of a cathedral, all shadows and cavernous echoes.  His legacy, it was woven in the long years, the seasons of change and the endless tuning of instruments.  He was a weaver, you see, pulling threads of sound from the air, shaping them into something new, something that held the weight of the world and the whisper of hope. \n\nThe piano, that was his loom. Sometimes it spoke softly, a murmur in the corner of the room. Other times, it roared like a firestorm, shaking the soul with its brilliance. But always it held the heart of the music, a steady pulse beneath the layers of sound. \n\nHe knew his men. Each note he wrote, each phrase he crafted was a brushstroke, meant to bring out the light in their playing. They weren't just musicians, they were souls given voice. He gave them the space to sing, to soar, to bleed their hearts out onto the stage. \n\nAnd the sound that came out, it wasn't just jazz. It was a language older than words, a rhythm that spoke to the bone, a story whispered across generations. Creole Love Call, that was a taste of it.  The voice, it wasn't singing, it was a raw instrument, a cry from the soul. The trumpet, it wailed like a lost lover, and the clarinet, it danced like a ghost. \n\nHe built his world with sound, brick by brick, note by note.  He was a magician, conjuring worlds from thin air, and his orchestra, his band of brothers, they were his instruments, his tools, his family. \n\nAnd when they played, they didn't just play music. They played life.  They played love, and loss, and hope, and despair. They played the human condition, laid bare.",
            "The want had always been there, a hollow ache in her gut. A hunger that no amount of clothes or trinkets could fill. It began when she was fourteen, a whisper in the shadows of adolescence, and three years later, at seventeen, it still gnawed at her. It wasn't things she craved anymore, but something more. Someone. Yet, the boys who came around, stumbling over clumsy gestures and awkward words, held no allure. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life without leaving a trace. She'd spent years dissecting this strange emptiness, searching for the root of it, but the answers remained elusive. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions, her desires a constant, unsettling presence.\n\nHome was usually a place of quietude, a haven of calm. Her parents, weathered souls with a gentle equilibrium, rarely raised their voices, their disagreements as rare as a summer rain. The only discordant note was her own, a vibrant melody of independence that sometimes clashed with their placid rhythms. She was the storm in their gentle world, a whirlwind of energy and spirit, a force that drew people to her like moths to a flame.\n\n\nBut this day, the air was thick with tension. She drifted from room to room, seeking inspiration, a spark to ignite her soul, when a piercing cry shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice trembling with pain. Panic surged like a tidal wave. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. \n\nThere, on the floor, was her mother, clutching her side, her face contorted in agony. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words a strained whisper. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice resolute, \"tell me where to pick you up.\" \n\nHer mother weakly directed her, and the daughter, her own strength augmented by fierce love and necessity, lifted her mother into her arms, carrying her to the car. She cradled her mother in the backseat, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, and drove with a speed that bordered on reckless.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the hushed murmur of voices washed over her as she rushed her mother into the hospital. Fear threatened to engulf her, but she pushed it down, her focus narrowed to a single point: her mother's wellbeing. She found a nurse, her voice trembling, \"Please, help her!\" \n\nHer mother was whisked away, examined, and her daughter was left to wait, her anxiety a tangible presence in the air. \n\nLater, the doctor emerged, his face grave. Her mother, he explained, had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase on a high shelf.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, dry and unforgiving.  A sun bleached the world bone white, a sun that spoke of long days and long nights, and the slow, inexorable march of time. This was the land where the heart, like a worn-out flint, ground down to dust against the endless stretch of days. It was here, in this desolate expanse, that they sought the solace of the aMed, a way of life as ancient as the land itself. \n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this aMed, a diet born from the dust and the sun, a way of finding sustenance in a world stripped bare. It was a pact with the earth, a recognition of the balance between what was given and what was taken. More than just food, it was a philosophy, a ritual of consumption, a quiet defiance against the encroaching silence.\n\nThese women, daughters of the dust themselves, they knew this truth. They had tasted the bitter sting of the desert, felt the sun beat down upon their backs, their skin taut and weathered like old leather. They had watched their kin wither and fall prey to the silent hunger that stalked the land.\n\nThe aMed became their shield, a bulwark against the creeping despair. It spoke of abundance in the face of scarcity, of life blooming in the barren cracks of existence. It was a way to honor the earth, to return to the rhythms of the seasons, to find solace in the simple act of nourishment.\n\nThey spoke of it in numbers, these women, these disciples of the aMed. They measured it in points, in ratios, in the meticulous accounting of grains and greens, of fish and fats. They documented their devotion in notebooks bound with twine, their voices a whisper against the wind.\n\nThey followed the aMed with a solemn determination, a quiet faith that could only exist in the face of relentless hardship. They knew that the path ahead was long, that the desert held its own cruel truths. But they held fast to their belief, their aMed a flickering ember in the vast darkness.",
            "The country coughed, choked on its own dust. 2007. The year the bones of the American dream cracked. The jobs, the houses, the promises – all turned to ash in the wind. Banks, fat and bloated, collapsed like rancid meat in the sun. Corporations, once as tall as the pines, fell like dry timber. The air hung thick with the scent of rot.\n\nThey tell you it was greed, these men in suits with their slick tongues and empty eyes. They whisper about sub-prime loans, CDOs, CDSs – words like tombstones marking the graves of good sense. But it was more than that. It was a sickness, a rot in the heart of the nation. A hunger for something more, something bigger, that devoured everything in its path.\n\nClinton, they say, set the stage. He wanted to be remembered, to leave his mark on the world. So he loosened the reins, let the wolves into the henhouse. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, puppets dancing to the tune of Wall Street, repackaged the poison, sold it as salvation.\n\nAnd the people, they bought it. They poured their hopes and dreams into these flimsy promises, these houses built on sand. They believed in the American dream, in the myth that everyone could have a piece of the pie. But the pie was a lie, a thin crust hiding a hollow center.\n\nThe bubble burst, slow at first, then with the force of a hurricane. The houses, the jobs, the dreams – all shattered. The economy, the world itself, teetered on the brink.\n\nWe are left picking up the pieces, trying to rebuild from the ashes. But the wounds run deep. The scars of greed and avarice are etched into the very fabric of our nation. The question is, can we learn from this? Can we resist the siren song of easy riches, the lure of quick profits? Or are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes, to fall again into the abyss?",
            "The rusted swing set creaked in the wind, a lonely metronome marking the passage of time in this forgotten corner of the world.  It was the kind of place where stories went to die, swallowed by dust and the weight of silence.  Not a good place for exposition, not a place for long winded tales of \"how things were\" or \"how they came to be.\"  Here, stories were hard-won, snatched from the jaws of oblivion, like a scrap of meat from a predator's maw.\n\nYou see, folks in these parts learned early on that the world didn't care for pleasantries.  It didn't reward flowery language or elaborate backstories.  It demanded grit, demanded action, demanded you show, not tell. \n\nTake that hero of yours, that woman with the tragic past.  Don't just tell me she loved her husband.  Let me see it in the way she clutches a faded photograph, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips as she traces the outline of his face.  Let me hear it in the tremor of her voice when she speaks his name, a whisper that echoes with the weight of a thousand unspoken words.\n\nDon't dump a laundry list of facts about her life onto my lap.  Weave it into the fabric of the story, let it unfold like a tapestry, thread by thread, revelation by revelation.  Let me see the scars of her past etched upon her soul, the way her eyes flinch at the sound of a sudden noise, the tightness in her grip on the worn handle of her purse.\n\nBecause in this world, words are precious, each one a bullet fired from a loaded gun.  Every sentence should count, every paragraph should move the story forward, every scene should leave a mark.  \n\nSo, my friend, ditch the exposition.  Embrace the silence.  Let the story breathe.  And show me what you've got.",
            "The air hung thick with the hum of the news. Two faces from Columbus stared out from the screen. The first, a man named Shad Hostettler, his eyes hollow pits in a face marred by something feral. They called it a \"stabbing,\" an unseemly word for the violence that had drenched Ashley, Ohio. Two minutes, that's all they gave him. A fleeting glimpse of evil in the flickering light.\n\nThe next face, nameless, belonged to a boy named Travis Buyers. Eighteen years old, they said, shot down in the shadows of Sharon Woods. The SWAT team, they said, was searching for answers. But the boy's story, it seemed, was lost in the static. A black boy, a black neighborhood, a life extinguished with little more than a flicker in the news cycle. \n\nThe world moved on.\n\nA story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber whisper of death, a five-thousand-dollar bounty for whispers of the shooter's name. The rain, they said, would come. Thunderstorms, they said, but the forecast was a cold comfort in the face of such violence.\n\nThen a story of a robbery, a man described with a chilling attention to detail: dark-skinned, black as night, a hoodie pulled tight against the darkness. They lingered on the details, as if the color of his skin was the most important thing they could tell you.\n\nRene Rodriguez, they said, a name that echoed in the empty room. A Texas drug kingpin, sentenced to \"300\" months, they said, a number that hung in the air like a death sentence. Hispanic, they said, as if his heritage was some kind of explanation.",
            "The blood ties, they bind. A knot that won't loosen, no matter the strain. Brother to brother, a connection forged in fire and shadow. Love, sure, but also the sharp edges of envy, the clawing need to be better, to be first. They see themselves in each other, not the mask they wear for the world, but the raw truth beneath. The kind of truth that cuts deep, a truth that bleeds. \n\nIt's in the hard times, when the world turns cold and the bones ache, that this bond reveals its true face. A face that can be both beautiful and terrible, a face that holds the weight of the past and the promise of the future.  \n\nThis is the story the ibis tells, a story of two boys, their lives intertwined like the roots of the ancient oaks in their yard. One strong, one frail. One reaching for the sun, the other clinging to the shadow.  The landscape itself, lush and green, turns to a crucible of heat and despair. Pride, a coiled serpent, whispers in the protagonist's ear, urging him onward, toward a destination that will shatter them both.  \n\nIt's a story told in shades of green and red, a story where the weight of a brother's gaze can crush a spirit. The boy sees himself in his brother, a reflection distorted by the needs and desires of his own heart.  A heart that beats with a terrible, consuming pride. And in the end, both brothers are changed, forever marked by the cost of their bond.",
            "The mind, a tangled thicket of bone and sinew, a crucible of bone and blood.  They used to say it was a wax tablet, smooth and blank. Then a scroll, unfurling secrets in the dust. A book, bound and heavy with words. Now they say it's a machine, cold and clockwork. But the truth is stranger, wilder than any metaphor. \n\nInput, they call it. A flood of raw sensation. Light striking retina, sound waves drumming on eardrum, a caress on skin.  These are the whispers that become a storm in the brain, a churning chaos of electrochemical fire.  \n\nDownward, upward, the signals climb and fall, twisting through a labyrinth of neurons. A black box on white, they say. Simple. But the mind sees not just the box, it sees the emptiness it holds, the shadow it casts.  A premonition of the unseen, a reaching for meaning.\n\nThen the filter.  A cold eye sifting through the noise. This is important. This is noise.  The whisper of a name in a crowded room. The endless drone of the wind in the pines.  The filter decides what to hold, what to discard.  \n\nAnd what is held, is stored.  A fleeting glimpse, a taste of honey, a word spoken in the dark.  Each memory a fragile thing, a flickering flame in the vast darkness.  Sensory, working, long-term.  A fleeting impression, a grasp held for a moment, a story woven into the fabric of being.\n\nBut how is it organized? A web, they say. A network of connections, each node a thought, each thread a link to another.  But the web is vast, ever-shifting, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience.  \n\nThe brain, they say, is a machine.  But it is also a garden, a wild and unruly thing, where seeds of memory bloom and wither, where thoughts take root and spread. It is a mystery, a universe unto itself, and its secrets are just beginning to be revealed.",
            "The world Huxley paints in *Brave New World* is a landscape choked by the encroaching tendrils of technology and the iron grip of capital. A dystopia where the individual is a withered husk, a mere cog in the machine of collective happiness.  Community, they say, trumps all else. Pleasure, immediate and manufactured, is the currency of the day. But behind the shiny façade, the citizens are but puppets, their strings pulled by the World Controller, their minds steeped in the manufactured bliss of a single, suffocating ideology.\n\nMarxist eyes see through the veneer. Huxley whispers his suspicions of these systems, the seeds of discontent sprouting in the fertile ground of his tale. Words like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" echoes of Marx's own pronouncements, reverberate through the pages. The reader senses the author's unease, a foreboding that the very fabric of society is being woven with threads of oppression.\n\nHuxley's satire cuts deep, targeting the heart of capitalism's insidious lie: \"false consciousness.\" The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true power dynamics at play. The proletariat, the cogs in the machine, are lulled into a haze of consumerism, their desires stoked by the World Controller. The hypnotic hum of hypnopædia, a relentless barrage of subliminal messages, reinforces the cycle. Consume, indulge, be happy. But true freedom, true will, is a mere phantom, a whisper lost in the wind.\n\nHegemony, the silent control wielded by the dominant class, is woven into the very tapestry of this world. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, exist in a blissful ignorance, blindly accepting their place in the hierarchy. They are the unwitting pawns, \"buying into\" an ideology that keeps them enslaved. The upper classes, while aware of the machinations, remain complicit, content in their own gilded cages.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are shallow, transactional, devoid of the messy, unfiltered emotions that define true connection. Huxley seems to be suggesting that the relentless march of technology and capitalism has stripped humanity of its essence, leaving behind hollow shells. Love, empathy, passion - all are sacrificed at the altar of convenience and efficiency.\n\nThe characters themselves, even the prominent ones, are strangely flat, lacking the depth and complexity that would suggest genuine individuality. Perhaps this is Huxley's point: technology and capitalism, working in tandem, have homogenized humanity, leaving us all as pale reflections of a forgotten past.",
            "The sun bled pale over the endless asphalt, dust motes swirling in the thin air.  Four and a half semesters. Four and a half seasons spent circling this iron and stone cockeyed town. The East Halls. A godforsaken barracks at the edge of things. An hour's trudge to Willard, across fields that once held only scrub and silence. Now choked with concrete and steel, the university spreading like a disease. They say it was a swamp once. Those fields, thick with cattails and the cries of crows. Now a concrete jungle, breeding new anxieties. \n\nI'd talked to a boy, just a year or two older, who remembered the old days. Empty land.  A place to breathe. He spoke of it with a kind of reverence, a yearning for something lost. Now the new buildings rise like mausoleums, monuments to a forgotten past. The Creamery, the health building. They're spitting distance from my own door now, but the distance feels like miles. \n\nThey say the solution is mobility. Wheels. But wheels don't solve the problem. They just shift it. You need to be part of the flow, ride the currents.  A friend, he'd come back to the bike after years of forgetting.  He spoke of it with a kind of wonder, like rediscovering a lost language. \"It's the only way,\" he said. \"The only goddamn way.\"  \n\nI bought a bike. A rusty old thing, but it runs. Twenty-five minutes by foot, a punishing slog to Thomas. Five on two wheels. The wind in your face, the burn in your legs. You're part of the city then, not just another lost soul in its labyrinth.  But Pollock Road, a black vein running through the heart of it all, it's a treacherous thing.  A place where the asphalt cracks and the wind bites. \n\nWalking is for those who have time. For the lost and the lonely. And I have nothing left to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust settled on the road, a fine grey shroud over the cracked asphalt. The heat pressed down, thick and relentless, like the hand of some unseen boy. This was the kind of world that chewed you up and spit you out. A world where the lines between right and wrong blurred like the horizon on a day choked with smoke. I saw that myself, years back. A boy, barely sixteen, huddled on a friend's couch, his face pale as bone, eyes haunted. Abused, the friend told me. Said he'd called the cops. I went to see for myself, a fresh-faced graduate with a psychology degree, thinking I could maybe help. The parents, nervous, their faces etched with lines of deceit. They spun tales of manipulation, of a troubled child, a boy who sought attention. But I saw the truth in the boy's eyes, the fear that clung to him like a shadow. That day, a seed took root. A need to do more than just talk, more than just observe. A need to reach into the darkness and pull those shadows back from the edge. \n\nThat's why I want to be a social worker. To be the hand that reaches out, the voice that speaks for those silenced by fear and despair. To stand with the boys and girls caught in the crossfire of broken families, the silent victims of a world that often forgets them. It ain't just a job, it's a calling. It's about service, respect, about digging deep into the heart of things, facing the ugliness head-on, and fighting for what's right. It's about standing tall against the tide of apathy, of indifference.\n\nEvery day, I see the cracks in this world. The pain, the anger, the despair. I see it in the faces of those who've lost their way, in the eyes of children who've seen too much too soon. And I know, deep inside, that I can't just stand by. I have to do something. I have to make a difference.\n\nIt's not just about helping families, though that's a part of it. It's about fighting for justice, for equality, for a world where everyone has a chance, where every voice is heard. It's about remembering the humanity in ourselves and others, even when it's hard to see.\n\nThis world needs healers, people who can mend the broken, who can bring light to the darkness. And that's what I want to be. That's what I'm fighting for.",
            "The dust of the world settled on the bones of insomnia, a sickness of the mind as much as the flesh. Some say it's in the blood, a legacy passed down through generations, a whisper in the genes that keeps the eyes open when they should be closed. Others say it's the world that breaks you, the weight of it pressing down, the endless grind of existence, the shadows that stretch long and cold in the heart.\n\nThey call it the Biological Model, this study of the body's wiring, the circuits that fail to shut down. They talk of neurons in the hypothalamus, tiny sparks of life that govern the sleep and wakefulness, hijacked by a phantom hand. They whisper of orexin, a chemical messenger, and GABAB receptors, the gatekeepers of slumber. They find that in mice, a drug called baclofen, a GABAB agonist, can coax the weary body into rest. But can these lab-bred creatures truly reflect the human condition? Can a chemical concoction mend the cracked soul, the wounds inflicted by a world that forgets the solace of the night?\n\nThen there are the others, the ones who speak of the Sociocultural Model, who see insomnia as a product of the world's brokenness. They point to the endless churn of society, the crushing weight of expectations, the relentless march of progress that leaves no room for stillness. They see the scars of racism, the gnawing ache of poverty, the indifference of the masses, and they say these things seep into the marrow, keeping the mind awake, alert, and ever-dreading.\n\nThey say the darkness is where the monsters hide, and the world won't let us sleep until we've faced them all.\n\nThis is the burden of insomnia, a duality of despair, a whispering in the dark. Can the body be healed without tending to the soul? Can the world be made whole without mending the broken hearts within it?",
            "The wind scoured the dust across the plains, a dry rasp against the bones of the world. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they called it. A sickness of the ears, but not of the hearing. It was a hunger in the mind, a thirst for meaning that went unquenched. They said the brain, that vast, dark cavern, couldn't make sense of the whispers coming in.  Words scattered like ashes in the wind, unable to take shape. \n\nA child might sit in a classroom, the sounds of a dozen voices a swirling chaos, a symphony of gibberish. A teacher's words, clear as a bell, might pass through, unnoticed, unheeded. They saw the teacher's mouth move, but the meaning, the light behind the words, remained a phantom.\n\nThey called it a disorder, a sickness, but it was a kind of exile. A solitary prison built within the skull, where the music of the world played on, but the melody remained forever beyond reach.\n\nThey tried to measure it, to capture it in tests and charts. Questions whispered against a background of static, echoes bouncing off the empty chambers of the mind.  But the silence remained, a vast, echoing emptiness.\n\n\nThere were ways, they said, to help them. To build bridges across the chasm, to find a language the mind could understand. The teacher, a shepherd in this wilderness of sound, could try to guide them, to carve a path through the noise. A slower pace, a softer voice, a spotlight on the words, a hand to steady the trembling soul. \n\nThey were searching, these teachers, for a way to bridge the gap, to bring the light back to the shadows. To remind the child that even in the darkest corners, the music of the world still played on.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it whispers of a truth, that disguise, though it may serve a purpose, a dark and fleeting purpose, in the end will consume the man who wears it.  Like a shroud, it clings, a shroud that steals the breath of the self. One must cast it off, or be lost forever in its folds.  But to lay the mask aside is to risk the sharp edges of truth cutting deep.  For some, the discovery of deceit, it will be met with indifference, a shrug of the shoulders.  But others, their wounds run deeper, festering in the dark places, and their anger, a wildfire, will consume all in its path.\n\nGendered disguise, it adds another layer to the torment. A question arises, a gnawing question: why?  Why would a soul seek to shed its own skin, to become something it is not? Why embrace the  shadow of another?  In Viola's case, the need for protection is a driving force.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town...\" she speaks, her words laced with the desperation of a castaway, \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nYet in this masquerade, she finds herself adrift. Cut off from the woman's world, from the solace of her sisters.  And the deception, it deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own. Olivia, blinded by her own desires, mistakes Viola for Sebastian, her affections falling upon the shadow of a man. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  \n\nAnd Orsino, the Duke, he too is ensnared, his own heart drawn to the disguise,  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nTwelfth Night, it offers a glimpse into the depths of the human heart, a heart in which desires may linger, unspoken, until the arrival of a stranger, a catalyst, to stir them awake.  Does Olivia's love for Cesario stem from a yearning for the forbidden, a desire masked as attraction?  Or does she, in her own way, reflect the judgments of her time, a time in which appearances held sway?  The ease with which she turns from Cesario to Sebastian speaks to a shallowness of heart, a preference for the tangible over the true.\n\nIn the end, Viola is forced to shed her borrowed skin, to reveal the woman beneath.  But the question remains:  has she, in her journey through disguise, lost a part of herself?  And what of those who have loved her in her guise?  Will they accept the woman she truly is, or will they be left with the bitter sting of betrayal?",
            "The dust of empire hung heavy in the air, a pall over the land. German, they called it, a grip on the throats of men and the earth itself.  Brutal, they said, the stain of it, especially in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama.  But empires are vast, their shadows spread long and crooked. Not a single brushstroke could capture the whole of it.  \n\nFrom Kamerun's shadowed forests to the sun-scorched plains of East Africa, the hand of empire fell differently.  Schools sprang up in some places,  places where the whispers of knowledge were carried on the wind. Africans learned to read, to write, their minds catching fire with the spark of literacy.  But in the desolate heart of South West Africa, the land bled dry and the wind sang a lonely song, the story was different. \n\nThere, the schools were shadows, faint and flickering.  Missionaries, their hearts heavy with a piety that tasted of salt and sorrow, took up the mantle of education, their efforts meager and stretched thin. The government, its eyes fixed on the gold in the ground and the profits to be drawn from the land, offered little more than a pittance.  \n\nEuropeans, they built their schools, brick and mortar monuments to their own dominion. Their children, their futures, were carefully tended. But the native sons and daughters were left to the whims of the desert wind, their minds left barren and thirsty.  \n\nThe echoes of this disparity lingered long after the dust of empire settled. While the lands of the north bloomed with the fruits of knowledge, South West Africa remained a parched land, its people trapped in a cycle of ignorance and despair. \n\nWhat led to this stark contrast?  What whispers in the hearts of settlers and rulers sowed the seeds of such stark division?  The answers lie buried deep within the sands of history, waiting to be unearthed.",
            "The music they call Popular, it’s sprawled out now, a hundred years of it, a thousand branches reaching. Rock, Rap, Country, Jazz, Folk – each one a thicket, and inside each thicket, more shades, more whispers.  Heavy Metal, though, that’s a beast. It’s grown wild, a whole forest of its own. \n\nThey say it’s the noise, the way it claws at the sky. More bass, more guitars screaming, more drums like hammers on a skull. And the darkness, that’s the heart of it. It holds the shadows, the things that lurk beneath the skin.   \n\nBut the darkness, it’s not just loud. It’s in the soul of the music. The pain, the rage, the longing, all those things they try to keep buried, they come out in the Metal. It's an echo of something old, something primal. \n\nIt started somewhere, a whisper in the dark. Bands like Black Sabbath, they were the first to open the gate. They took the blues, the rock and roll, and twisted it, turned it inside out. They made it bleed. \n\nAnd from that bleed, a thousand things grew. Thrash, Death, Doom, Black – names that taste like ash and blood. Each one a different shade of the darkness, each one a reflection of the soul. \n\nThe thing about Metal, it’s a movement, not just a sound. It’s a fire, burning bright and hot, and it’s changed the world. It’s made people feel things, things they thought were buried too deep.

            "He dreamt of it, the acceptance, the praise. A brushstroke of recognition against the canvas of his life.

No schooling in the fine arts, just the raw yearning of a heart that saw the world in colors no one else seemed to see.\n\nHe painted, yes, but his dreams were not the dreams of the Parisian salons, those gilded cages where art was a currency, a commodity. His were the dreams of a man who saw the jungle in his soul, the serpents and birds of paradise tangled in the brushstrokes of his mind.\n\nHe painted The Dream, a woman lost in a world of impossible blooms and beasts that whispered of forgotten gods. It was his own aliveness, his soul laid bare, a plea for understanding. To be seen, not for the man he was, but for the visions he held within.\n\nBefore him lay a choice: mimic the masters, bend to the will of the critics, or paint the truth that burned within him, raw and unfiltered.\n\nHe was a man torn between the comfort of mimicry and the ache of originality. The Dream, it was his struggle laid out for all to see. The woman, lost in her world, a mirror to his own lost soul, searching for acceptance in a world that seemed determined to keep him out. \n\nRousseau, the outsider, the man with the artist's heart and a gabelou's soul, painted his dreams, hoping that in their impossible beauty, he might finally find his place.",
            "The old saying goes, Truth is beauty, beauty truth.  A kind of knowing that comes not from book learnin' or years on the road but from some deeper place, somethin' that sits low in the gut. Like a cold wind blowin' through the bones. We chase after explanations, try to pin down what makes a picture sing or an act righteous, but it always eludes us.  It's like tryin' to catch smoke.\n\nTake a face like the Mona Lisa, for instance. You can talk all day about light and shadow, perspective and composition. But what makes her heart sing?  What draws you in and holds you there? You might say, \"There's just somethin' about it.\" And that somethin' ain't explainable. It's a truth that resides beyond words, beyond reason.\n\nSame goes for the things we hold dear, the things that make a man stand tall, the things that guide him through the dark.  Morality, like art, ain't a set of rules, a code to be followed. It's a feelin', a sense of right and wrong that runs deeper than any law or doctrine.\n\nFlannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" It's the same with ethics, ain't it? You can dissect it, analyze it, but there's always somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that whispers in the dark corners of the soul.\n\nWittgenstein, he said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed.\" It's a truth that transcends words, a truth that lives in the space between the lines, in the silence between the notes.\n\nAnd that's where the connection lies, ain't it? Both art and morality touch us at a level that's beyond the reach of language, beyond the grasp of reason. They speak to us in a language older than words, a language that resonates in the marrow of our bones.",
            "The shadow of the Alps falls long over München, stretching down through the heart of a country where the Rhine flows like an ancient serpent through Köln, and the Elbe whispers its tales through the gray stones of Dresden. This is Germany, a land stitched from many threads, a tapestry woven from the rumors of long-forgotten tribes and the echoes of empires past.\n\nGermania. The very name itself hangs heavy, its meaning lost to the winds of time. Some say it came from the Tungrians, a people Tacitus spoke of, who crossed the Rhine in a tide of iron and blood, their name a whispered echo of a time before. Others claim it comes from the Gauls, those they fought and vanquished, who used the word “Germanus” to mark the difference between conquered and conqueror. Caesar himself, in the heat of battle, used it to define the enemy, the wild men beyond the known world. \n\nHe saw them as a shadow, a threat lurking on the edge of the map, a whisper of chaos in the ordered world he sought to build. A people of spears and war cries, their name a guttural sound, a challenge to the Roman world. Or perhaps, it's a word born of the spear itself, the \"ger\" that pierced the shields of the Roman legions. Or maybe from the ancient Irish, \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” a testament to their fierce voices in the echoing silence of the forests.\n\nTacitus, the Roman chronicler, saw something different. He saw a land untouched, a people untouched by the mingling of races, a wildness that he both feared and admired. He saw them as aboriginal, like the wind blowing through the barren plains, unyielding and untamed.\n\nAnd they were. The Germanic tribes, they moved like ghosts across the borders of the Roman world. They traded their furs and weapons, their skills as warriors, filling the ranks of the Roman legions. They were a shadow, a whisper on the wind, a force that could not be ignored.\n\n\nBut the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. The land was too wild, the people too strong. They pushed and they pulled, they built walls and marched armies, but the spirit of Germania remained.\n\nAnd so it is today. The echoes of those ancient tribes still resonate in the heart of this nation. The shadow of Germania lingers, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, the wild heart can never be truly tamed.",
            "The bowl drained, a slow, sucking sound, leaving only the residue of what had been. I stared into its depths, mind a blank slate. No thought, no judgment, just the raw, unfiltered vision of the brown stain clinging to the porcelain. Like a child, I watched, mesmerized, as the water seeped away, revealing the truth.  \n\nOnce, I’d read about an artist who claimed to see the world differently. He spoke of a “frame,” a way to isolate the essence of a thing.  A bowl of fruit, a landscape, even a pile of shit, could be reduced to its barest elements. I tried to summon that vision now, to impose that frame on the scene before me. But the brown stain resisted. It was too much, too immediate, too visceral.  \n\nThey called it art, they called it creativity, but all I felt was the pulse of its ordinariness. Picasso and his blues, Monet and his green fields, the Italians and their riot of colors – they all seemed distant, unreal. This was my truth, my story. My brown moment.  \n\nMy hand reached for the handle, muscles tightening, a familiar ritual.  I squeezed, the porcelain cold beneath my grasp. The stain remained, a stubborn defiance. A second squeeze, a sharper jolt, and the handle slipped. The brown matter, a lump of flesh and fiber, refused to yield.  \n\nThe mop lay abandoned, a pool of pale green against the stark white tile.  My tie, a noose of cheap fabric, constricted my throat. I stared at the stain, a silent, simmering rage building within. It was a message, a challenge.  I would conquer it, reduce it, make it mine.  The toilet paper, a flimsy white shroud, beckoned. I reached for it, my hand plunging into the abyss, a grim specter in the porcelain purgatory.",
            "The road eats them young. These boys and girls, they climb in behind the wheel and become statistics. A cruel arithmetic of speed and inexperience. The doctors, they say the boy's mind ain't made yet. Still wet clay under the wheel, liable to crumble under pressure. It ain't just that, though.  It's the hunger, the need to prove something. They gotta show their peers they ain't afraid of nothin'.  A car becomes a cage of steel and glass where they think they're invincible. \n\nThe ones with the bright eyes and the reckless grins, they fill the passenger seats with their friends, and the laughter turns to screams faster'n a rattler strikes. The South, they got numbers too, they say. More metal and blood on the asphalt. More broken families and empty chairs.  \n\nThey try to make it safer, they do. These licenses, they call 'em provisional, like a trial run.  But that ain't the answer. It's a bandaid on a gaping wound.  The truth is, the young ones, they ain't ready. They ain't got the patience, the sense, the damn weight of the world on their shoulders. \n\nThere's a man, Zuckerman, says they crave the danger, the rush of it all. Like moths to a flame, they're drawn to the edge. And when you're chasing shadows, you're bound to fall.\n\nSo what do you do?  You wait. You let them grow.  Let the fire in their hearts cool a little.  Teach 'em respect for the road, for the metal they're piloting, for the lives they might take. \n\nLaws, they can help.  A nationwide thing, maybe.  No wheel for them till they're eighteen, or older.  Some more time behind the wheel with a grown man, learning the rhythm of the road, the whisper of the wind through the trees.\n\nWe need to save these kids. Before the road takes them.",
            "The library housed a darkness, thick and ancient, like the breath of the forgotten. I sifted through the Edison films, a flickering catalog of shadows. Fifteen trick films, they called them. Born of the crucible of 1895 to the nascent dawn of 1901. A conjuration of deceit, stitched together with the barest threads of editing. My task: to unravel their secrets, to map the poetics of illusion.\n\nMost danced to the same tune: confined within the proscenium's rigid embrace. No camera to wander, only a fixed gaze upon the stage of shadows. A stage inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville's flickering lights, from the hush of a magician's trick.  Figures moved in a prescribed dance, a back and forth, a waltz within the frame. Like Uncle Josh in that Spooky Hotel (1900), they entered from the right, their steps confined to the horizontal plane. They faded from view, but the camera remained unmoved, a silent sentinel guarding the artifice.\n\nThe proscenium's grip extended to the very length of the shots. Long shots, sometimes a medium's fleeting glimpse, but never the intimacy of a close-up. The audience, like the stage, demanded the whole, the entirety of the performance laid bare. No secrets hidden in the close embrace of a face, no intimate whispers in the shadows.\n\nEach trick film adhered to a rigid code: one thought, one film. A minute, perhaps less, depending on the cadence of the frames. A fleeting glimpse, a spark of wonder, then swallowed by the darkness.  A vaudeville routine, a fleeting enchantment, with little room for narrative's embrace.\n\nYet, deception can take many forms. What appears as one shot, a singular breath of illusion, might be woven from several threads. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) whispers of this. A closer look reveals the seams, the subtle shifts, the conjuration of a severed head. A single, unbroken illusion, but a tapestry of hidden truths.",
            "The man was John Taylor, a son of the soil, born of Caroline. A Republican through and through, he'd carved his life from the land, a life that bled into his politics. A farmer, sure, but more than that, a man who'd seen the soul of America in the furrowed fields and the sweat of honest labor. Freedom, that's what he fought for, freedom in the furrows, freedom in the ballot box, freedom in the very air he breathed. \n\nHe believed in the power of the simple life, a life untainted by the machinations of distant halls and the whispers of a grasping government.  He saw the young nation, fragile as a newborn fawn, and he knew it needed tending, not coddling. He saw the Constitution as a promise, a shield against the encroaching darkness of tyranny.  \n\nHe'd seen the world, seen the rot that festered in the hearts of men, the hunger for power that devoured reason and compassion. He knew that man was a creature of both light and shadow, capable of both great good and unspeakable evil. That's why he fought for a government bound by its own rules, a government that understood its place, a government that dared not tread too heavily on the delicate balance of liberty. \n\nHe'd seen men like his uncle, a man of the land, his hands calloused from years of honest labor, his eyes reflecting the wisdom of the fields.  His uncle, a man who understood the value of hard work and self-reliance, a man who knew the true meaning of freedom.  And he'd seen men who craved power, men who sought to control, to manipulate, to bend the will of others to their own selfish desires.\n\nHe knew the danger of unchecked ambition, the seductive allure of power, the slow creep of corruption. He fought against it, tooth and nail, with the fierce determination of a cornered lion, with the unwavering conviction of a man who knew the stakes.",
            "The logs, they fell off a cliff come the third month. Figure 17. Disheartening, it was. Hard to say why. Winter's grip tightens on a New England campus, see. Fewer folks peddling bikes, fewer folks walking. Makes sense. December, though, that's when the semester ends. Papers due, grades tallied, everyone scrabbling for an escape. Maybe the log just got lost in the shuffle.  \n\nThen there's the holidays, looming like a black cloud, swallowing up the month. Students gone, faculty scattered, the campus a ghost town. January rolls in, cold and empty, classes start again. Still, that February dip, that's a mystery.  \n\nMaybe it's just the way of things. A burst of fire at the start, then the embers die down. We tried to fan the flames with the Carpool Challenge, a blitz in March. Worked, too, submissions climbed back up. But the ebb and flow, the rhythm of it all, that's the challenge, see? Keeping the thing alive when the natural pulse weakens, and when holidays and semesters break the flow. \n\nAnother thing, people, they like their cars. It's freedom, independence, the open road. It's ingrained in us. You gotta offer something to get them to break free. Gift cards, we gave out plenty. Restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage or two. Local bookstore, some national chains thrown in. Would something bigger have worked? A bike, maybe? Or a hybrid, a real electric dream machine?  \n\nMaybe the bigger prizes would have kept the logs flowing. The cards, they were fine at first, but what if we'd upped the ante? Announced a couple of bikes in December, then a hybrid, maybe even an electric car in January?  A carrot, dangling just out of reach.",
            "The wind picked up dust devils across the barren plain. It rattled the bones of a rusted hulk of a machine, a thing they called an ETF. A cage, some might say, holding promises of wealth, but at what cost?  It tracked a phantom, a shadow called an index, a collection of whispers promising growth. A slick way to gamble, they said, but the house always won.\n\nThis particular cage, they called it IHF. Inside, ten beasts, big and powerful, fuelled the market's hunger. 63.58% of the cage's contents they devoured, leaving a gnawing emptiness behind.  The boys, the educated ones, said a cage was better than the wild, safer, more predictable.  They pointed to numbers, to percentages, to the sleek, cold gleam of a balance sheet.\n\nBut what of the soul, the heart of the matter?  Could these cages, these fabricated beasts, ever truly capture the wildness, the unpredictable dance of the market? Could they truly offer a path to fortune, or were they just a gilded trap, a mirage in a desert of greed?\n\nThey crunched the numbers. They dissected the ten beasts, their strengths and weaknesses laid bare. They built a cage of their own, a smaller, more focused structure, a challenge to the IHF's supposed dominion.  They measured the risk, the reward, the cold, hard calculus of return.  But something was missing.\n\nThe wind howled, a mournful cry in the emptiness. The caged beasts stirred, their eyes gleaming with a cold, alien light.  The boys, lost in their calculations, failed to see the truth:  the market was not a game, not a puzzle to be solved. It was a living thing, a wild, unpredictable beast, forever beyond the reach of cages and charts.",
            "The land of dreams, a place Poe called Thulé, echoes with the ghost of Virgil's island, a place beyond the known world.  But Poe, a man steeped in the ink of German writers, knew a deeper well.  He drank deep from Goethe's well, a darkness mirroring his own.\n\nThis Thulé, it speaks of a kinship, a shared sorrow, a king mourning a queen in a world drained of color.  The King of Thulé, a man consumed by grief, shadows Poe's own demons, his own self-destruction mirrored in the goblet's final plunge into the sea.  Was it imitation? Or something more?  Arndt, a scholar of Poe's soul, saw the kinship, the echo of Goethe's words in Poe's own.\n\nGoethe, a titan of German literature, wove his own Thulé in the tapestry of Faust, a king's lament a symphony of despair.  A king's wife, gone, leaving behind only a goblet, a constant reminder of loss. The king drinks, drowns in his sorrow, until the cliffs themselves beckon, the sea a final embrace.  \n\nPoe, like a raven, circled these themes, his Thulé a bleak reflection of Goethe's.  There's a darkness in both, a hollowness that speaks to a shared human experience.  Poe, the American poet, found kinship in the darkness of a German soul, his own Thulé a testament to the universality of grief.\n\nHis references, though fleeting, are not random.  The Pit and the Pendulum, Dream-Land, echoes of Thulé reverberate, a haunting reminder of the shared human experience of loss and despair.\n\nAnd what of Tennyson?  A bridge between worlds, a literary kinship that bound Poe to Goethe's legacy.",
            "The applesauce slicked the linoleum floor, a slick testament to negligence.  Jennifer Palmer, she fell.  A crack in her back, a lifetime of pain. Now she comes for justice, not just for the broken bone, but for the way the store manager, Martin, had turned his back on her, twice. He knew. He had been warned, twice, about the spill. Twice.  But Malice. That's the word. That's what she needs to prove.  Willful disregard. A heart cold as the applesauce in the aisle.\n\nThe law, it says, a man can't just shrug off responsibility.  Not when he knows the danger, sees the path to harm laid bare.  Five slips already that year, they say.  Five times the warning signs.  And still, he ate his dinner.  Didn't have time for complaints, he told the young man, Rich. Didn't have time for safety.  \n\nMalice, they say.  Can you prove it? Was it a heart turned to stone? A soul black as the bruise on Palmer's back? \n\nThe judge, he'll listen. He'll weigh the evidence, the spilled applesauce, the warnings ignored, the broken body.  He'll see the pattern, the disregard, the coldness of a man who chose his dinner over another's safety.  And maybe, just maybe, he'll see the malice, too.",
            "The ash was thick in the air, a grey shroud over the memory of things. Four years, maybe more, since I sat in that classroom, the dust of argument clinging to the air like the scent of burnt oil. Islam. They called it hostile.  Neighbors with eyes cast down, whispers in the aisles.  But the air’s changed now, the world’s shifted. They whisper different things. Tolerance, they call it.  A word that tastes like ash in the mouth. \n\nThe Prophet’s story, it claws at the edges of the mind. A man built up like a monument, yet the stones whisper of a different man.  The one they tell me about, the one they try to sell you, is a martyr, misunderstood, humble. A shepherd leading sheep to a green pasture, not a king forcing them to kneel.  A man who called on God in the desert, not a storm that swept across the land, leaving only silence and obedience in its wake. \n\nThey say he multiplied the mutton, the milk, feeding forty men with a handful of scraps.  A trick of the light, they say.  But the echoes of another man’s miracle linger, a shadow cast long across the years.  The same gesture, the same hunger for something more, something beyond the desert.  It’s a theft, a pale imitation, a whisper in the wind trying to drown out the roar.\n\nAnd the whispers of the faithful. Stories passed from hand to hand, each one a step further from the truth.  They say they heard it from the one who heard it from the one who saw it. The truth, they say, is in the echo.  But echoes fade, and what remains is only the silence, a silence that screams.\n\nThe man they try to paint as gentle, as wise, the man they build into a god, his hands stained with blood, his eyes cold and hard.  History whispers a different truth, a truth they try to bury under mountains of sand.  Do the faithful know, do they truly know, the man they worship?  Or are they blind to the shadow that follows him, the shadow that falls over all he touches?",
            "The dust of the gospel settles. The teachings of the man from Nazareth, the words spoken on a hill, lost in the echoes of the centuries. What remained, what blossomed, bore little resemblance to the seed.  A creeping vine, strangling the trunk, twisting the limbs, growing fat on the fruits of dogma and creed.  \n\nThey say the world is changing, turning its face toward the light.  But the light it seeks is a pale reflection, a flickering flame compared to the sun.  The old ways, the rigid pews, the whispered prayers, these cling to the faithful like barnacles to a ship, heavy with the weight of tradition. But the tide is turning. A whisper in the wind, a rustle in the leaves, a yearning for something more.\n\nThey will remember.  The forgotten words, the simple truths, the stark reality of the man and his message. The layers will peel away, the gloss of centuries stripped bare. Back to the bones, back to the source. A slow, inexorable tide, dragging the church back to the shore of its origins.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, the towering edifice, will lead the way. A shepherd guiding its flock, herding them back to the fold.  But the fold will be different. No longer a patchwork of sects and denominations, but a single, unified body, bound by the thread of the original message.\n\nThis is the way of history.  The pendulum swings.  The empires fall.  The tides turn.  Just as the Roman legions once marched on Jerusalem, so too will the spirit of the Nazarene march on the world.  Just as the chains of slavery were broken, so too will the chains of dogma be shattered.  \n\nIt will be a time of reckoning. A time of stripping away the layers, the embellishments, the accretions of time.  A time of returning to the wellspring, to the source, to the man who spoke of love and forgiveness and a kingdom not of this world.   \n\nWhat remains then?  The word.  The spirit.  The simple truth.   The man himself. A carpenter from Nazareth.",
            "The air in Packingtown hung thick and sour, a miasma of iron and rot. The factories, black monoliths against the dying light, spewed their smoke like a serpent's breath, staining the sky a sickly gray. Their owners, men with hearts as black as the coal dust that clung to their fingers, cared only for the cold, hard currency that flowed from the endless grind. They saw their workers not as men, but as cogs in a machine, expendable parts to be ground down and discarded.\n\nSinclair's words hung in the air, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A river of smoke, a river of despair. The stench of it, the taste of it, a constant reminder of the cost of progress, a progress that seemed to flow only to the pockets of the men at the top.\n\nThey worked them, these men, these women, these children, to the bone. Long hours, for meager pay, in conditions that would choke the life out of a lesser breed.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  \n\nThey were trapped, these souls, in a system designed to keep them down. No safety net, no voice, no hope. The factories loomed over them, a constant threat, their gears grinding out a rhythm of misery. The cries of the injured, the stench of the slaughterhouse, the dust that settled in the lungs and filled the eyes - it was a living hell, and they were condemned to walk its paths.\n\nSinclair's words echoed again, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"\n\nThey were slaves, these workers, bound by chains of circumstance, their humanity eroded by the relentless grinding of the machine. They dreamed of escape, of a world where men were valued for more than their sweat and toil, but that dream seemed as distant as the stars.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything.  A white dust, a gray dust, sifting through the air like whispers of a forgotten time. Fitzgerald knew this, understood the way colors could settle on a soul, etch themselves into the very fabric of a story.  He used them like brushstrokes, painting meaning onto canvas. White, for the brittle sheen of wealth, the cold gleam of unfulfilled desire. Gray, for the faded edges of dreams, the hollow ache of longing.  \n\nHe draped them on Daisy like a shroud, the white of her dress a stark beacon against the ash-gray backdrop of her life. White, the color of a porcelain doll, fragile and beautiful, yet empty inside. White, the color of a lie, a facade carefully constructed to conceal the truth. And gray, the color of her past, the faded memories of a girlhood spent chasing shadows.\n\nHe saw it in the way she moved, a ghost in white slipping through the gaudy rooms of Gatsby's parties. He saw it in the way her voice, once vibrant, now held a brittle edge, a whisper of forgotten promises. \n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of color.  He knew how to make it sing, to make it bleed, to make it whisper stories of hope and despair. He used it to build Gatsby's world, a world of shimmering gold and lurid reds, a world built on illusions and fueled by a desperate longing for something more.",
            "The sun beat down on the dust of San Diego County, baking the earth hard.  The land was thirsty, but it bore fruit nonetheless. Tomatoes fat and red, citrus heavy with juice, greens bright and crisp.  Squash and broccoli, herbs and peaches, lemons clinging to the trees. Berries plump, honey thick in the comb, peppers fiery and sweet. This was a land of plenty, but the bounty came at a cost.  \n\nThe people of San Diego craved the pureness of it, the absence of taint, the honest taste of the earth.  They sought out the organic, the unadulterated, the soul of the food itself. Waiting lists stretched long for the bounty of the local farms, their baskets filled with organic eggs and milk. These farmers, they walked a different path, a harder path, but one that promised more than just profit.\n\nThey spoke of biodiversity, of the land whispering back to them in the rustle of leaves and the flight of birds. They spoke of the silence after the spray, the return of the creatures that had fled the poisons.  But the land, it was unforgiving. The weeds grew thick, the pests came ravenous. Every inch required tending, every harvest a struggle.  Scale was a weapon the big farms wielded, efficiency their shield. But here, in the heart of it all, the small farmer toiled, sweat on their brow, hope in their heart.\n\nThis land, it held a story. A story of Native hands that had tilled it for generations, of cattle that grazed beneath the sun, of wood cutters who brought forth the fire.  Now, a new chapter was unfolding.\n\n\nA parcel of land near Potrero, 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, whispered its own secrets. The Cleveland National Forest pressed close, a silent observer. The air hummed with the murmur of life, the cries of unseen birds, the rustle of creatures hidden in the shadows. This was a place of convergence, where the wild met the cultivated, where the past and present intertwined.\n\n\nHere, the future of farming was being written, a delicate balance between profit and preservation. This was the story of a landowner seeking guidance, a farmer seeking solace, a land seeking renewal.  This was a story of hope.",
            "The dust of a bargain hangs heavy in the air, heavier than the smoke from a dying fire. Culture, you see, ain't a thing you can point to. It's a ghost, a shadow, a way of seeing the world that clings to a man like a shroud. To say all Russians are stubborn, or all Japanese are accommodating, that's to mistake the echo for the song. \n\nIt's in the way a man looks at you, in the silence he holds, in the way his hand rests on the table. It's the weight of his ancestors, the stories whispered down through generations, the unspoken rules that bind them. \n\nTo walk into that, you gotta shed your own skin. You gotta see the world through their eyes, with their ghosts at your shoulder.  You can't judge it, you can't change it, you can only learn to dance with it. Especially when you're on shaky ground, when your hand's not the strongest at the table.\n\nA company, it's a culture too, a different kind of ghost. Some wear their rules like armor, others let them drift like smoke. The way they dress, the words they choose, the way they move, it all whispers a story. Some believe in feeding the poor, others only the bottom line. \n\nBut beneath it all, there's the values. Those are the bones, the heart of the matter. Why do they do what they do? What do they hold dear?\n\nA man who values face won't break it, even at the cost of a deal. A man who values the deal will drive hard, until the last drop of blood is squeezed out.\n\nLearn those things, and you'll get further than any textbook could tell you. But remember, even the best lesson book can't teach you the language of a man's soul.",
            "The fool, he says in his heart, there is no God. A saying from the Psalms, a seed planted in the stony ground of Anselm's proof. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same beast, the same God, the same question of faith and reason. To understand their struggle, we must first accept their premise: God, the God of scripture, the God of their own making, exists. A God who whispers in the dark corners of the mind, a God whose fingerprints are etched on the fabric of the world.  \n\nAnselm, he digs deep within, searching for the echo of the divine in the chambers of the soul. God is a thought, a concept so perfect, so complete, that to deny his existence is to deny the very act of thinking itself.  It's a logic born of the heart, a faith whispered in the silence of introspection.  He doesn't need the cold steel of reason, the hard evidence of the senses. His God is a fire in the soul, a truth known before it's spoken.\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path, a path paved with logic and observation. He looks to the world, to the order and beauty that surrounds him, and sees the hand of a creator.  In the changing seasons, the intricate dance of life and death, he sees the signature of a craftsman, a master architect. He seeks proof in the tangible, in the observable, in the patterns that weave the tapestry of existence.\n\nBut do either of these men truly touch the heart of the matter? Does Anselm's faith-based reasoning truly offer a satisfying answer, or does it simply reaffirm what is already known? Does Aquinas's reliance on reason, on the tangible world, leave room for the mystery, the ineffable, the spark of the divine that transcends the grasp of logic?  Both offer glimpses, fragments of a larger truth, but neither, perhaps, holds the full key to the mystery of God.  The fool may indeed say there is no God, but the wise man knows that the search itself, the yearning for something beyond the mundane, is perhaps the truest testament to the divine.",
            "The wind scoured the plains. A prince, they called him, though he knew no king.  He was born in the dust of a time long gone, a time before the whispers of a man called Buddha had risen to fill the empty valleys of the world.  He was born into a world of pain, a world of endless wanting, a world that clung to things like a drowning man to a raft. A world he would come to abandon.  He’d trade the silks and the silver for the ragged cloth of a wandering man, the jeweled throne for the silence of the mountains. He’d walk barefoot on the ash of a world consumed by its own desires.\n\nHe’d come to see it all, the endless churn of birth and death, the grasping at shadows, the clinging to fleeting things. He saw the suffering etched on the faces of men, the fear that gnawed at their hearts, the emptiness that echoed in their souls. He saw the truth of it all, the truth that lay hidden beneath the shimmering layers of illusion. \n\nHe saw it and he knew. He knew the world was a fever dream, a transient flicker in the vast darkness. And he knew the way out.\n\nThey called him Buddha, the Awakened One, after he’d walked the path, stripped bare the layers of self, and seen with the eyes of truth.  He spoke of the four noble truths, the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the truth of the path to its end.\n\nThe world, slow to understand, clung to the old ways. They built temples and shrines, carved his words into stone, and turned his teachings into a religion. They called it Theravada, the way of the elders, though the elders had forgotten the echo of his voice, the tremor in his hand as he pointed to the way.\n\nThe water-cutting ceremony, they said, was a tradition, a way to honor him. But it was a shadow, a pale imitation of the truth he’d spoken.  The rituals, the chants, the offerings, they were all just dust motes dancing in the sun, unable to pierce the veil of ignorance.\n\nThe world, they say, changes. And so did the religion.  Forces, both gentle and harsh, both internal and external, shaped the tree, bending its branches, twisting its roots. Some sought to preserve the essence of the Buddha’s teachings, others to mold them to their own needs.  The community, both those who lived in the monasteries and those who walked the world, they all changed. They clung to the words, but the meaning, the spark of recognition, that flickered and dimmed.",
            "The sun beat down on the dust, baking the earth the color of bone.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of shadows.  Fifty-seven years they circled each other, a rivalry older than the cottonwood trees along the Rio Grande. From the first shot of the Texas Revolution in '36 to the dying embers of the First World War, the air crackled with tension. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) say it was a high-water mark of hate, a war painted in the blood of both people. The Mexican-American War, a thirsty beast that swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving a bitterness that lingered like the smell of smoke.\n\nBut it wasn't just about land. It was a clash of souls, a tangle of roots reaching deep into the earth. Religion, culture, tradition - all ground to dust in the mill of ambition.  Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31) called it a collision of interests, a dance of devils that whispered promises of power.\n\nThis wasn't a new song. Borders, like scars, hold the memory of old wounds.  Nations born in the shadow of their neighbors, fighting for space and sustenance.  Pletcher (1977, p. 41) saw it in Mexico and Cuba, two thorns in the side of the American eagle.  He saw it in their eyes, the same hunger, the same fear, the same yearning for something more.\n\nThe ghosts of Spain and England haunted the land, their whispers weaving a tapestry of distrust.  Frahm (2001, p. 86) spoke of the fear of the other, the dark stain of Catholicism and monarchy, a threat to the very soul of America. It was a cold war waged in the name of God, a battle for hearts and minds.\n\nBorders bled, towns burned, and men died.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) cataloged 17 clashes, each a testament to the fragile peace.  Bands of desperados roamed, leaving trails of blood and misery in their wake.  Schmitt (1974, p. 97) saw it as a struggle for control, a game of chess played with lives.\n\nBut the tide turned.   Mexico, weakened and weary, found itself bowing to the will of its northern neighbor.  Schmitt (1974, p. 109) explained it as a shift in focus, a hunger for dollars replacing the thirst for land.  The war ended, not with a bang, but a whimper. A new kind of dance began, one of dependence and exploitation. The dust settled, but the memories lingered, etched in the hearts of two nations forever bound by their shared past.",
            "The illness came sudden as a winter storm, fifteen years gone now.  A darkness fell, stole the light from my world.  Nurse I was, back then.  Thought I'd chosen it safe, secure.  A girl needs that, I reckoned, when the world ain't built for her kind.  \"Always a need for nurses,\" they'd say, \"sick folk there'll always be.\" So, I did it.  Though the scientist in me yearned, the journalist, maybe both. Nurse it was.\n\nBut there I was, forty-six and alone, bank account thinner'n a ghost's prayer, body broken. Fifteen years on disability now, Social Security my only shield against the cold. Nothing left, not a dime, not a trinket. I scrape by, but every day's a fight, a claw at the edge of something vast and hungry.\n\nNothing's certain anymore, save this:  I wouldn't have made it these years without the folks who held me up, family and friends, a few good souls.  When the world turns dark, you find out who's standing beside you.\n\nSee, life's full of emergencies, small and big.  No use pretending they won't come. You can plan, you can prepare, but some things are too big, too awful to face alone.\n\nThey talk 'bout rugged individualism, 'bout how that built this country.  But the truth is, the folks who crossed the plains, who carved this land, they did it with something more than grit.  It was compassion, respect, helping hand.  Wagon trains, they didn't make it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be ready.  I am.  Got my kits, my supplies, my candles and matches.  If you've the land, grow your own food, preserve it.  A wood stove, good in a pinch, if you ain't livin' in a box. But don't forget, while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors.  That's the real strength, the kind that lasts.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, a rasping breath across the bones of the world. It whispered through the dust, carrying the faint scent of things lost, of growth and decay, of the slow, relentless march of time. How did life, this fragile thing, this tapestry of bone and blood and sinew, come to be shaped as it is? What unseen hand guided the coil of the shell, the curve of the spine, the intricate dance of the genes? \n\nThompson, back in the sway of a bygone era, spoke of the zoologist's limited grasp on the language of life. But now, in this time of shadowed knowledge, the whisperings of mathematics begin to weave a new understanding. We see echoes of this language in the spiral of the mollusk, in the slow, unfolding drama of its shell.\n\nWe take the shell, this vessel of memory and history, and hold it to the light. Each whorl, a whisper of a moment, a testament to the journey through time. The columella, a silent guide, marking the path through the labyrinthine spaces of growth.  The suture, a scar, a seam, where one moment bleeds into the next.  \n\nWe map these whispers, these echoes, with the cold precision of numbers. We seek to understand the boundaries of possibility, the constraints that shape the dance of life.  And in the depths of this mathematical ocean, we glimpse the hidden currents, the forces that sculpt the forms of existence.\n\nAnd though the answers may lie beyond our grasp, the journey itself is a revelation. In the spiraling shell, in the whisper of the wind, we see a reflection of our own unfolding, our own journey through the vast, chaotic symphony of being.",
            "The breath of death hung heavy over Indonesia.  The babes and the mothers, they clung to the edge of the grave.  For ten long years, the numbers had sat like a tombstone, unchanging, unyielding.  The country, it danced with the specter of progress, a waltz with the Millennium's phantom promises.  Water and sanitation, they'd tamed those beasts, but the children, the mothers, their plight remained a festering wound.  \n\nThey'd coaxed more births under the watchful eye of a healer, a midwife's hand or a doctor's touch.  Seventy-two percent, they boasted, but the numbers whispered a lie.  Those midwives, they held the thread of life, but their hands were not strong enough to mend the fabric when it tore.  Hemorrhage, the silent killer, stalked the shadowed corners of their progress.\n\nEven the children, the scourges of diarrhea, grew less likely to find a hand to lift them from the brink.  Postnatal care, a whisper lost in the wind, a promise unkept.\n\nThe steel of the scalpel, it was a rare sight, a mere 4% of the births it graced.  A tale of two cities it painted, however.  In the concrete jungles, the c-section a common friend, 7% of them, but in the endless fields, it was a phantom, a ghost at 2%.  The city walls, they held the cure, the promise, leaving the countryside to wither.  And the poor, their hands empty, their pockets lighter, they were left to wallow in despair, their 27% gap a chasm too wide to cross.\n\nSo what now?  Should they patch the holes, stitch the wounds, with a thousand programs, each a band-aid on a broken body?  Or should they mend the very bones of the system, the heart that pulsed with life?  The siren song of quick fixes, they were tempting, seductive.  But the shadows danced, whispering of unintended consequences.  To pour all their might into one, what of the others?  The rustle of neglected needs, the silent cries of forgotten corners.\n\nThey stood at a crossroads, the weight of a nation on their shoulders.  To heal the land, they must first heal the system, mend the cracks that ran deep.  Only then could they truly hope to banish the specter of death.",
            "The stifling weight of Victorian detail, the relentless scrutiny of the aristocracy, these things suffocate the soul. It is in the shadows, in the whispers of the uncanny, that true life unfurls. Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, dare to break free from the gilded cage of convention, venturing into the darkness, illuminating the hidden depths of the human heart. Both weave tales spun with mystery and the strange, a departure from the predictable norms of their time, and in this departure, they find a depth of characterization, a searing glimpse into the tangled webs of motive and emotion. \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels plumb the depths of the subconscious through dreams, or states that mirror them, though their purpose and form differ. In *Oliver Twist*, these surreal experiences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his nascent understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if caught in a nightmare, while he struggles to find help. The passage underscores his helplessness, the grip of despair tightening around him. His senses are numb, he doesn't perceive the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; the pain is a constant ache, a companion to his fear rather than a sudden shock. The question arises: whose will has orchestrated his misfortune? Certainly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little to no control, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome, even when his life hangs in the balance. This defeat is palpable, a creeping shadow cast by Fagin, who seems to be breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept this bleakness, stealing his ability to resist. \n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "The boy, Adrian, he was a puzzle. A whisper of a thing, skinny as a rail, with eyes that held the wisdom of a man twice his age.  He spoke English with the fluency of a native, yet the alphabet, it was a labyrinth to him. Letters danced and jumbled, some pronouncements struck true, others like a hammer blow to a brittle glass. I worked with him after school, pouring over words, trying to coax meaning from the chaos. Years I'd spent learning the craft of language, but this, this was different.  \n\nOne day, his mother came to the program. Her face, etched with worry, spoke a language I understood better than any tongue. She made no sound, only the gesture of a bird caught in a net, wings beating uselessly against the bars. I knew then. He knew the words, the sounds, the rhythm. But the alphabet, that was foreign. A map uncharted, a sky without stars.\n\nIt was a slow awakening, a dawning in the gray. We talked, or rather,  I tried to talk, with broken Spanish, her hands my bridge to understanding. Adrian, he watched, his eyes absorbing it all, like a sponge drawing in the rain.\n\nThat story, it hangs over me still, a reminder of the walls we build, the chasms we create.  It's a problem we face here, in this land of many tongues. Not just the language barrier, but the unseen barriers, the assumptions we make, the stories we tell ourselves. \n\nThere are no easy solutions, no silver bullets. Dual language programs, they are a start, a seed in the dry earth. But they need nurturing, they need time, they need the understanding that true education is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It's a journey, a dance, a conversation that never ends.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the silence. We sat on the porch,  the wood slick beneath our hands, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and pine.  He'd been thinner lately, his shoulders slumped as if the weight of the world had settled there. He didn't look up when I asked about his favorite bird. Just stared out at the rain-soaked yard, a look in his eyes that was both searching and lost.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he finally said, his voice a rasp. \n\nI remember thinking how the word seemed to hang in the air, heavy with meaning. Like a prayer unspoken. We smoked our cigarettes, the smoke curling up into the gray sky, each pull a silent question mark. We were both searching for something, but neither of us knew what.\n\nThe world, he'd say sometimes, is a cruel and indifferent place. But there's still beauty in it, he'd say, if you know where to look. I'd look at him, at the lines etched on his face, the way his eyes seemed to hold the weight of a thousand stories, and wonder if he truly believed it himself.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my birthday. The doctors had said he had weeks, maybe months, but he didn't last that long. The chemo, the radiation, it just kept him tethered to this world, prolonging the inevitable. What God, I thought, would allow such suffering? I didn't pray. God had stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. So I didn't go.\n\nThey didn't even call me. \n\nI curled up in my bed, the sheets pulling tight around me, and waited for the news.  I waited for the final curtain to fall on a life that had already faded.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" a term that rings hollow like a bell in a tomb, is, as Ian Watt tells it, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" It's been kicked down, praised up, called shallow, called sublime. Horace Walpole, the man who birthed the thing in \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he took the old tales, the ruins and the ghosts, and shoved them into the new shape of the novel. He wanted \"A Gothic Story,\" he declared. He wanted to grab at the reader's throat and whisper of the dark things hidden in the heart of the world.\n\n\"Gothic,\" that word, it had always been a whisper of the past, a shadow on the edges of the world. It meant old, it meant crude, it meant the things that civilization had left behind. But Walpole, he saw something in that shadow, something that scared and thrilled him. He took the old theatrics, the crumbling castles and howling winds, and he put them into a new skin, a skin of words that allowed the reader to see the darkness in their own minds. That's the thing about Gothic, it's always both old and new, it's the echo of a heartbeat in the darkness.\n\nOne of the things that stirs in the darkness of Gothic is the idea of chivalry. The old knights, the brave heroes of a forgotten time, they are there, their swords rusted but their spirits burning. Walpole, he saw the world falling apart around him, the old ways crumbling, the new ways cold and hard. He looked at the knights of old, at their honor and their courage, and he saw a reflection of something lost. He wanted to bring that back, to remind people of the good that might still be there.\n\nTake Frederic, for instance. He's the prince, the hero, the man who has seen suffering and loss. He's everything a knight should be, and more. The reader sees him, not just as a character, but as a symbol, a reminder of what might have been.\n\nWalpole, he was a man of his time, a man who saw the world changing too fast. He saw the old ways dying, and he wanted to hold onto something, something real, something true. And so he wrote his Gothic story, a story of shadows and darkness, but also a story of hope, a story of the enduring power of the human spirit.",
            "The dust of things. That's what it all boils down to. A chain of them, strung out like beads on a thread. From the call of need, the wanting of a customer, back through the bones of the earth itself, to the raw seed of an idea. They call it supply chain, this whole business. A grand phrase for something as plain as hunger.  \n\nIt started back in '82, some man named Oliver. Said it was all about planning, driving the gears of it all to keep the wants of men fed.  Six strands, he laid it out. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the place of it all, the moving of it, and the whispers of information. All tied together like a knot, hard to pull apart.\n\nProduction first. The heart of it.  Where the raw stuff is turned to something you can hold. Managers, they sit like vultures over the market, watching what men crave. What they need, what they'll steal, what they'll pay good coin for. Then comes the making.  The how and the when, the where and the why.  The world is a factory now, churning out things men don't even know they need. More than they need. Until the shelves are full and the warehouses overflow, and the dust settles on the things men forgot.\n\nThen comes the supply. The veins that carry the blood of the whole thing.  Finding the places, the hands, the tools to make it all work. Sometimes it's done in-house, a family secret, passed down through generations. Sometimes it's given away, outsourced to strangers in faraway lands. All for the sake of speed, of keeping the wheels turning.\n\nThe rest follow.  Inventory, a pile of promises, waiting to be fulfilled. Location, a dance of logistics, finding the right place for the right thing at the right time. Transportation, the groaning of trucks and trains, the clatter of ships, the endless movement of things. And finally, information, the whispered secrets that bind it all together. A constant flow of data, keeping track of what's where, what's needed, what's coming next.\n\nBut it's all dust in the end.  The things we make, the things we buy, they all fade away. Left behind are the bones of the chain, the empty trucks, the silent factories.  And the dust settles.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, held aloft by a lone figure. Ellen Page, face pale beneath the harsh streetlights, her eyes fixed on some unseen horizon. On the cardboard, scrawled in a shaky hand, the words cut like a blade: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nBurma. A name that clung to the tongue like ash. A country choked by a regime born of iron and blood, a junta that had seized power in a swift, brutal coup, silencing dissent for decades. In 2007, the saffron robes of monks had bled crimson, staining the streets of Rangoon. A silent uprising, a whispered rebellion, drowned in the echoing drums of military might.  They called it The Saffron Revolution, a fragile flame flickering against the suffocating darkness.\n\nJournalists vanished, their cameras silenced.  Nagai, the Japanese photographer, a victim of the junta's savage indifference, left a silent testament to the truth they sought to bury.  The official count spoke of 13 dead, a meager offering to appease a world that refused to see. But Colonel Hla Win, a whisper from the shadows, spoke of bodies piled high, thousands swallowed by the earth, their cries swallowed by the dust.\n\nThis was not new. The hunger for power, the insatiable thirst for control, a disease that festered in the heart of man.  From the Caesars, who draped themselves in the mantle of divinity, to the emperors of Japan, their divine mandate stained with the blood of dissent, to the presidents who whispered in the dark with men like Haggard, the cycle of repression spun its grim tapestry.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000 lost souls, drowned out by the official count of 200-300. Rwanda, a nation fractured by hate, where the drums of genocide echoed through the valleys, the stench of blood clinging to the wind.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare spun from twisted ideology, where millions perished, their ashes scattered by the winds of tyranny.\n\nThe sign swayed, a silent plea in a world deaf to its cries.  A stark reminder that the shadows of history loom long, and the fight for freedom is a perpetual battle.",
            "The darkness fell on Duke's music like a shroud, but not one of despair. It was the darkness of a cathedral, all shadows and cavernous echoes.  His legacy, it was woven in the long years, the seasons of change and the endless tuning of instruments.  He was a weaver, you see, pulling threads of sound from the air, shaping them into something new, something that held the weight of the world and the whisper of hope. \n\nThe piano, that was his loom. Sometimes it spoke softly, a murmur in the corner of the room. Other times, it roared like a firestorm, shaking the soul with its brilliance. But always it held the heart of the music, a steady pulse beneath the layers of sound. \n\nHe knew his men. Each note he wrote, each phrase he crafted was a brushstroke, meant to bring out the light in their playing. They weren't just musicians, they were souls given voice. He gave them the space to sing, to soar, to bleed their hearts out onto the stage. \n\nAnd the sound that came out, it wasn't just jazz. It was a language older than words, a rhythm that spoke to the bone, a story whispered across generations. Creole Love Call, that was a taste of it.  The voice, it wasn't singing, it was a raw instrument, a cry from the soul. The trumpet, it wailed like a lost lover, and the clarinet, it danced like a ghost. \n\nHe built his world with sound, brick by brick, note by note.  He was a magician, conjuring worlds from thin air, and his orchestra, his band of brothers, they were his instruments, his tools, his family. \n\nAnd when they played, they didn't just play music. They played life.  They played love, and loss, and hope, and despair. They played the human condition, laid bare.",
            "The want had always been there, a hollow ache in her gut. A hunger that no amount of clothes or trinkets could fill. It began when she was fourteen, a whisper in the shadows of adolescence, and three years later, at seventeen, it still gnawed at her. It wasn't things she craved anymore, but something more. Someone. Yet, the boys who came around, stumbling over clumsy gestures and awkward words, held no allure. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life without leaving a trace. She'd spent years dissecting this strange emptiness, searching for the root of it, but the answers remained elusive. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions, her desires a constant, unsettling presence.\n\nHome was usually a place of quietude, a haven of calm. Her parents, weathered souls with a gentle equilibrium, rarely raised their voices, their disagreements as rare as a summer rain. The only discordant note was her own, a vibrant melody of independence that sometimes clashed with their placid rhythms. She was the storm in their gentle world, a whirlwind of energy and spirit, a force that drew people to her like moths to a flame.\n\n\nBut this day, the air was thick with tension. She drifted from room to room, seeking inspiration, a spark to ignite her soul, when a piercing cry shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice trembling with pain. Panic surged like a tidal wave. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. \n\nThere, on the floor, was her mother, clutching her side, her face contorted in agony. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words a strained whisper. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice resolute, \"tell me where to pick you up.\" \n\nHer mother weakly directed her, and the daughter, her own strength augmented by fierce love and necessity, lifted her mother into her arms, carrying her to the car. She cradled her mother in the backseat, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, and drove with a speed that bordered on reckless.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the hushed murmur of voices washed over her as she rushed her mother into the hospital. Fear threatened to engulf her, but she pushed it down, her focus narrowed to a single point: her mother's wellbeing. She found a nurse, her voice trembling, \"Please, help her!\" \n\nHer mother was whisked away, examined, and her daughter was left to wait, her anxiety a tangible presence in the air. \n\nLater, the doctor emerged, his face grave. Her mother, he explained, had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase on a high shelf.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, dry and unforgiving.  A sun bleached the world bone white, a sun that spoke of long days and long nights, and the slow, inexorable march of time. This was the land where the heart, like a worn-out flint, ground down to dust against the endless stretch of days. It was here, in this desolate expanse, that they sought the solace of the aMed, a way of life as ancient as the land itself. \n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this aMed, a diet born from the dust and the sun, a way of finding sustenance in a world stripped bare. It was a pact with the earth, a recognition of the balance between what was given and what was taken. More than just food, it was a philosophy, a ritual of consumption, a quiet defiance against the encroaching silence.\n\nThese women, daughters of the dust themselves, they knew this truth. They had tasted the bitter sting of the desert, felt the sun beat down upon their backs, their skin taut and weathered like old leather. They had watched their kin wither and fall prey to the silent hunger that stalked the land.\n\nThe aMed became their shield, a bulwark against the creeping despair. It spoke of abundance in the face of scarcity, of life blooming in the barren cracks of existence. It was a way to honor the earth, to return to the rhythms of the seasons, to find solace in the simple act of nourishment.\n\nThey spoke of it in numbers, these women, these disciples of the aMed. They measured it in points, in ratios, in the meticulous accounting of grains and greens, of fish and fats. They documented their devotion in notebooks bound with twine, their voices a whisper against the wind.\n\nThey followed the aMed with a solemn determination, a quiet faith that could only exist in the face of relentless hardship. They knew that the path ahead was long, that the desert held its own cruel truths. But they held fast to their belief, their aMed a flickering ember in the vast darkness.",
            "The country coughed, choked on its own dust. 2007. The year the bones of the American dream cracked. The jobs, the houses, the promises – all turned to ash in the wind. Banks, fat and bloated, collapsed like rancid meat in the sun. Corporations, once as tall as the pines, fell like dry timber. The air hung thick with the scent of rot.\n\nThey tell you it was greed, these men in suits with their slick tongues and empty eyes. They whisper about sub-prime loans, CDOs, CDSs – words like tombstones marking the graves of good sense. But it was more than that. It was a sickness, a rot in the heart of the nation. A hunger for something more, something bigger, that devoured everything in its path.\n\nClinton, they say, set the stage. He wanted to be remembered, to leave his mark on the world. So he loosened the reins, let the wolves into the henhouse. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, puppets dancing to the tune of Wall Street, repackaged the poison, sold it as salvation.\n\nAnd the people, they bought it. They poured their hopes and dreams into these flimsy promises, these houses built on sand. They believed in the American dream, in the myth that everyone could have a piece of the pie. But the pie was a lie, a thin crust hiding a hollow center.\n\nThe bubble burst, slow at first, then with the force of a hurricane. The houses, the jobs, the dreams – all shattered. The economy, the world itself, teetered on the brink.\n\nWe are left picking up the pieces, trying to rebuild from the ashes. But the wounds run deep. The scars of greed and avarice are etched into the very fabric of our nation. The question is, can we learn from this? Can we resist the siren song of easy riches, the lure of quick profits? Or are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes, to fall again into the abyss?",
            "The rusted swing set creaked in the wind, a lonely metronome marking the passage of time in this forgotten corner of the world.  It was the kind of place where stories went to die, swallowed by dust and the weight of silence.  Not a good place for exposition, not a place for long winded tales of \"how things were\" or \"how they came to be.\"  Here, stories were hard-won, snatched from the jaws of oblivion, like a scrap of meat from a predator's maw.\n\nYou see, folks in these parts learned early on that the world didn't care for pleasantries.  It didn't reward flowery language or elaborate backstories.  It demanded grit, demanded action, demanded you show, not tell. \n\nTake that hero of yours, that woman with the tragic past.  Don't just tell me she loved her husband.  Let me see it in the way she clutches a faded photograph, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips as she traces the outline of his face.  Let me hear it in the tremor of her voice when she speaks his name, a whisper that echoes with the weight of a thousand unspoken words.\n\nDon't dump a laundry list of facts about her life onto my lap.  Weave it into the fabric of the story, let it unfold like a tapestry, thread by thread, revelation by revelation.  Let me see the scars of her past etched upon her soul, the way her eyes flinch at the sound of a sudden noise, the tightness in her grip on the worn handle of her purse.\n\nBecause in this world, words are precious, each one a bullet fired from a loaded gun.

Two minutes, that's all they gave him. A fleeting glimpse of evil in the flickering light.\n\nThe next face, nameless, belonged to a boy named Travis Buyers. Eighteen years old, they said, shot down in the shadows of Sharon Woods. The SWAT team, they said, was searching for answers. But the boy's story, it seemed, was lost in the static.

The rain, they said, would come. Thunderstorms, they said, but the forecast was a cold comfort in the face of such violence.\n\nThen a story of a robbery, a man described with a chilling attention to detail: dark-skinned, black as night, a hoodie pulled tight against the darkness. They lingered on the details, as if the color of his skin was the most important thing they could tell you.\n\nRene Rodriguez, they said, a name that echoed in the empty room.

A black box on white, they say. Simple. But the mind sees not just the box, it sees the emptiness it holds, the shadow it casts.  A premonition of the unseen, a reaching for meaning.\n\nThen the filter.  A cold eye sifting through the noise. This is important. This is noise.  The whisper of a name in a crowded room. The endless drone of the wind in the pines.  The filter decides what to hold, what to discard.  \n\nAnd what is held, is stored.  A fleeting glimpse, a taste of honey, a word spoken in the dark.  Each memory a fragile thing, a flickering flame in the vast darkness.  Sensory, working, long-term.  A fleeting impression, a grasp held for a moment, a story woven into the fabric of being.\n\nBut how is it organized? A web, they say. A network of connections, each node a thought, each thread a link to another.  But the web is vast, ever-shifting, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience.  \n\nThe brain, they say, is a machine.  But it is also a garden, a wild and unruly thing, where seeds of memory bloom and wither, where thoughts take root and spread. It is a mystery, a universe unto itself, and its secrets are just beginning to be revealed.",
            "The world Huxley paints in *Brave New World* is a landscape choked by the encroaching tendrils of technology and the iron grip of capital. A dystopia where the individual is a withered husk, a mere cog in the machine of collective happiness.  Community, they say, trumps all else. Pleasure, immediate and manufactured, is the currency of the day. But behind the shiny façade, the citizens are but puppets, their strings pulled by the World Controller, their minds steeped in the manufactured bliss of a single, suffocating ideology.\n\nMarxist eyes see through the veneer. Huxley whispers his suspicions of these systems, the seeds of discontent sprouting in the fertile ground of his tale. Words like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" echoes of Marx's own pronouncements, reverberate through the pages. The reader senses the author's unease, a foreboding that the very fabric of society is being woven with threads of oppression.\n\nHuxley's satire cuts deep, targeting the heart of capitalism's insidious lie: \"false consciousness.\" The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true power dynamics at play. The proletariat, the cogs in the machine, are lulled into a haze of consumerism, their desires stoked by the World Controller. The hypnotic hum of hypnopædia, a relentless barrage of subliminal messages, reinforces the cycle. Consume, indulge, be happy. But true freedom, true will, is a mere phantom, a whisper lost in the wind.\n\nHegemony, the silent control wielded by the dominant class, is woven into the very tapestry of this world. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, exist in a blissful ignorance, blindly accepting their place in the hierarchy. They are the unwitting pawns, \"buying into\" an ideology that keeps them enslaved. The upper classes, while aware of the machinations, remain complicit, content in their own gilded cages.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are shallow, transactional, devoid of the messy, unfiltered emotions that define true connection. Huxley seems to be suggesting that the relentless march of technology and capitalism has stripped humanity of its essence, leaving behind hollow shells. Love, empathy, passion - all are sacrificed at the altar of convenience and efficiency.\n\nThe characters themselves, even the prominent ones, are strangely flat, lacking the depth and complexity that would suggest genuine individuality. Perhaps this is Huxley's point: technology and capitalism, working in tandem, have homogenized humanity, leaving us all as pale reflections of a forgotten past.",
            "The sun bled pale over the endless asphalt, dust motes swirling in the thin air.  Four and a half semesters. Four and a half seasons spent circling this iron and stone cockeyed town. The East Halls. A godforsaken barracks at the edge of things. An hour's trudge to Willard, across fields that once held only scrub and silence. Now choked with concrete and steel, the university spreading like a disease. They say it was a swamp once. Those fields, thick with cattails and the cries of crows. Now a concrete jungle, breeding new anxieties. \n\nI'd talked to a boy, just a year or two older, who remembered the old days. Empty land.  A place to breathe. He spoke of it with a kind of reverence, a yearning for something lost. Now the new buildings rise like mausoleums, monuments to a forgotten past. The Creamery, the health building. They're spitting distance from my own door now, but the distance feels like miles. \n\nThey say the solution is mobility. Wheels. But wheels don't solve the problem. They just shift it. You need to be part of the flow, ride the currents.  A friend, he'd come back to the bike after years of forgetting.  He spoke of it with a kind of wonder, like rediscovering a lost language. \"It's the only way,\" he said. \"The only goddamn way.\"  \n\nI bought a bike. A rusty old thing, but it runs. Twenty-five minutes by foot, a punishing slog to Thomas. Five on two wheels. The wind in your face, the burn in your legs. You're part of the city then, not just another lost soul in its labyrinth.  But Pollock Road, a black vein running through the heart of it all, it's a treacherous thing.  A place where the asphalt cracks and the wind bites. \n\nWalking is for those who have time. For the lost and the lonely. And I have nothing left to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The dust settled on the road, a fine grey shroud over the cracked asphalt. The heat pressed down, thick and relentless, like the hand of some unseen boy. This was the kind of world that chewed you up and spit you out. A world where the lines between right and wrong blurred like the horizon on a day choked with smoke. I saw that myself, years back. A boy, barely sixteen, huddled on a friend's couch, his face pale as bone, eyes haunted. Abused, the friend told me. Said he'd called the cops. I went to see for myself, a fresh-faced graduate with a psychology degree, thinking I could maybe help. The parents, nervous, their faces etched with lines of deceit. They spun tales of manipulation, of a troubled child, a boy who sought attention. But I saw the truth in the boy's eyes, the fear that clung to him like a shadow. That day, a seed took root. A need to do more than just talk, more than just observe. A need to reach into the darkness and pull those shadows back from the edge. \n\nThat's why I want to be a social worker. To be the hand that reaches out, the voice that speaks for those silenced by fear and despair. To stand with the boys and girls caught in the crossfire of broken families, the silent victims of a world that often forgets them. It ain't just a job, it's a calling. It's about service, respect, about digging deep into the heart of things, facing the ugliness head-on, and fighting for what's right. It's about standing tall against the tide of apathy, of indifference.\n\nEvery day, I see the cracks in this world. The pain, the anger, the despair. I see it in the faces of those who've lost their way, in the eyes of children who've seen too much too soon. And I know, deep inside, that I can't just stand by. I have to do something. I have to make a difference.\n\nIt's not just about helping families, though that's a part of it. It's about fighting for justice, for equality, for a world where everyone has a chance, where every voice is heard. It's about remembering the humanity in ourselves and others, even when it's hard to see.\n\nThis world needs healers, people who can mend the broken, who can bring light to the darkness.

Some say it's in the blood, a legacy passed down through generations, a whisper in the genes that keeps the eyes open when they should be closed. Others say it's the world that breaks you, the weight of it pressing down, the endless grind of existence, the shadows that stretch long and cold in the heart.\n\nThey call it the Biological Model, this study of the body's wiring, the circuits that fail to shut down. They talk of neurons in the hypothalamus, tiny sparks of life that govern the sleep and wakefulness, hijacked by a phantom hand. They whisper of orexin, a chemical messenger, and GABAB receptors, the gatekeepers of slumber. They find that in mice, a drug called baclofen, a GABAB agonist, can coax the weary body into rest. But can these lab-bred creatures truly reflect the human condition? Can a chemical concoction mend the cracked soul, the wounds inflicted by a world that forgets the solace of the night?\n\nThen there are the others, the ones who speak of the Sociocultural Model, who see insomnia as a product of the world's brokenness. They point to the endless churn of society, the crushing weight of expectations, the relentless march of progress that leaves no room for stillness. They see the scars of racism, the gnawing ache of poverty, the indifference of the masses, and they say these things seep into the marrow, keeping the mind awake, alert, and ever-dreading.\n\nThey say the darkness is where the monsters hide, and the world won't let us sleep until we've faced them all.\n\nThis is the burden of insomnia, a duality of despair, a whispering in the dark.

They saw the teacher's mouth move, but the meaning, the light behind the words, remained a phantom.\n\nThey called it a disorder, a sickness, but it was a kind of exile. A solitary prison built within the skull, where the music of the world played on, but the melody remained forever beyond reach.\n\nThey tried to measure it, to capture it in tests and charts. Questions whispered against a background of static, echoes bouncing off the empty chambers of the mind.  But the silence remained, a vast, echoing emptiness.\n\n\nThere were ways, they said, to help them. To build bridges across the chasm, to find a language the mind could understand. The teacher, a shepherd in this wilderness of sound, could try to guide them, to carve a path through the noise. A slower pace, a softer voice, a spotlight on the words, a hand to steady the trembling soul. \n\nThey were searching, these teachers, for a way to bridge the gap, to bring the light back to the shadows. To remind the child that even in the darkest corners, the music of the world still played on.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it whispers of a truth, that disguise, though it may serve a purpose, a dark and fleeting purpose, in the end will consume the man who wears it.  Like a shroud, it clings, a shroud that steals the breath of the self. One must cast it off, or be lost forever in its folds.  But to lay the mask aside is to risk the sharp edges of truth cutting deep.  For some, the discovery of deceit, it will be met with indifference, a shrug of the shoulders.  But others, their wounds run deeper, festering in the dark places, and their anger, a wildfire, will consume all in its path.\n\nGendered disguise, it adds another layer to the torment. A question arises, a gnawing question: why?  Why would a soul seek to shed its own skin, to become something it is not? Why embrace the  shadow of another?  In Viola's case, the need for protection is a driving force.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town...\" she speaks, her words laced with the desperation of a castaway, \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"\n\nYet in this masquerade, she finds herself adrift. Cut off from the woman's world, from the solace of her sisters.  And the deception, it deepens, twisting into a labyrinth of its own. Olivia, blinded by her own desires, mistakes Viola for Sebastian, her affections falling upon the shadow of a man. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  \n\nAnd Orsino, the Duke, he too is ensnared, his own heart drawn to the disguise,  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nTwelfth Night, it offers a glimpse into the depths of the human heart, a heart in which desires may linger, unspoken, until the arrival of a stranger, a catalyst, to stir them awake.  Does Olivia's love for Cesario stem from a yearning for the forbidden, a desire masked as attraction?  Or does she, in her own way, reflect the judgments of her time, a time in which appearances held sway?  The ease with which she turns from Cesario to Sebastian speaks to a shallowness of heart, a preference for the tangible over the true.\n\nIn the end, Viola is forced to shed her borrowed skin, to reveal the woman beneath.  But the question remains:  has she, in her journey through disguise, lost a part of herself?  And what of those who have loved her in her guise?  Will they accept the woman she truly is, or will they be left with the bitter sting of betrayal?",
            "The dust of empire hung heavy in the air, a pall over the land. German, they called it, a grip on the throats of men and the earth itself.  Brutal, they said, the stain of it, especially in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama.  But empires are vast, their shadows spread long and crooked. Not a single brushstroke could capture the whole of it.  \n\nFrom Kamerun's shadowed forests to the sun-scorched plains of East Africa, the hand of empire fell differently.  Schools sprang up in some places,  places where the whispers of knowledge were carried on the wind. Africans learned to read, to write, their minds catching fire with the spark of literacy.  But in the desolate heart of South West Africa, the land bled dry and the wind sang a lonely song, the story was different. \n\nThere, the schools were shadows, faint and flickering.  Missionaries, their hearts heavy with a piety that tasted of salt and sorrow, took up the mantle of education, their efforts meager and stretched thin. The government, its eyes fixed on the gold in the ground and the profits to be drawn from the land, offered little more than a pittance.  \n\nEuropeans, they built their schools, brick and mortar monuments to their own dominion. Their children, their futures, were carefully tended. But the native sons and daughters were left to the whims of the desert wind, their minds left barren and thirsty.  \n\nThe echoes of this disparity lingered long after the dust of empire settled. While the lands of the north bloomed with the fruits of knowledge, South West Africa remained a parched land, its people trapped in a cycle of ignorance and despair. \n\nWhat led to this stark contrast?  What whispers in the hearts of settlers and rulers sowed the seeds of such stark division?  The answers lie buried deep within the sands of history, waiting to be unearthed.",
            "The music they call Popular, it’s sprawled out now, a hundred years of it, a thousand branches reaching. Rock, Rap, Country, Jazz, Folk – each one a thicket, and inside each thicket, more shades, more whispers.  Heavy Metal, though, that’s a beast. It’s grown wild, a whole forest of its own. \n\nThey say it’s the noise, the way it claws at the sky. More bass, more guitars screaming, more drums like hammers on a skull. And the darkness, that’s the heart of it. It holds the shadows, the things that lurk beneath the skin.   \n\nBut the darkness, it’s not just loud. It’s in the soul of the music. The pain, the rage, the longing, all those things they try to keep buried, they come out in the Metal. It's an echo of something old, something primal. \n\nIt started somewhere, a whisper in the dark. Bands like Black Sabbath, they were the first to open the gate. They took the blues, the rock and roll, and twisted it, turned it inside out. They made it bleed. \n\nAnd from that bleed, a thousand things grew. Thrash, Death, Doom, Black – names that taste like ash and blood. Each one a different shade of the darkness, each one a reflection of the soul. \n\nThe thing about Metal, it’s a movement, not just a sound. It’s a fire, burning bright and hot, and it’s changed the world. It’s made people feel things, things they thought were buried too deep. And it keeps burning, keeps changing, keeps reaching out into the darkness.",
            "He dreamt of it, the acceptance, the praise. A brushstroke of recognition against the canvas of his life. A man named Rousseau, born to a tradesman's life, a gabelou, they called him, a toll collector. No schooling in the fine arts, just the raw yearning of a heart that saw the world in colors no one else seemed to see.\n\nHe painted, yes, but his dreams were not the dreams of the Parisian salons, those gilded cages where art was a currency, a commodity. His were the dreams of a man who saw the jungle in his soul, the serpents and birds of paradise tangled in the brushstrokes of his mind.\n\nHe painted The Dream, a woman lost in a world of impossible blooms and beasts that whispered of forgotten gods. It was his own aliveness, his soul laid bare, a plea for understanding. To be seen, not for the man he was, but for the visions he held within.\n\nBefore him lay a choice: mimic the masters, bend to the will of the critics, or paint the truth that burned within him, raw and unfiltered.\n\nHe was a man torn between the comfort of mimicry and the ache of originality. The Dream, it was his struggle laid out for all to see. The woman, lost in her world, a mirror to his own lost soul, searching for acceptance in a world that seemed determined to keep him out. \n\nRousseau, the outsider, the man with the artist's heart and a gabelou's soul, painted his dreams, hoping that in their impossible beauty, he might finally find his place.",
            "The old saying goes, Truth is beauty, beauty truth.  A kind of knowing that comes not from book learnin' or years on the road but from some deeper place, somethin' that sits low in the gut. Like a cold wind blowin' through the bones. We chase after explanations, try to pin down what makes a picture sing or an act righteous, but it always eludes us.  It's like tryin' to catch smoke.\n\nTake a face like the Mona Lisa, for instance. You can talk all day about light and shadow, perspective and composition. But what makes her heart sing?  What draws you in and holds you there? You might say, \"There's just somethin' about it.\" And that somethin' ain't explainable. It's a truth that resides beyond words, beyond reason.\n\nSame goes for the things we hold dear, the things that make a man stand tall, the things that guide him through the dark.  Morality, like art, ain't a set of rules, a code to be followed. It's a feelin', a sense of right and wrong that runs deeper than any law or doctrine.\n\nFlannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" It's the same with ethics, ain't it? You can dissect it, analyze it, but there's always somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that whispers in the dark corners of the soul.\n\nWittgenstein, he said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed.\" It's a truth that transcends words, a truth that lives in the space between the lines, in the silence between the notes.\n\nAnd that's where the connection lies, ain't it? Both art and morality touch us at a level that's beyond the reach of language, beyond the grasp of reason. They speak to us in a language older than words, a language that resonates in the marrow of our bones.",
            "The shadow of the Alps falls long over München, stretching down through the heart of a country where the Rhine flows like an ancient serpent through Köln, and the Elbe whispers its tales through the gray stones of Dresden. This is Germany, a land stitched from many threads, a tapestry woven from the rumors of long-forgotten tribes and the echoes of empires past.\n\nGermania. The very name itself hangs heavy, its meaning lost to the winds of time. Some say it came from the Tungrians, a people Tacitus spoke of, who crossed the Rhine in a tide of iron and blood, their name a whispered echo of a time before. Others claim it comes from the Gauls, those they fought and vanquished, who used the word “Germanus” to mark the difference between conquered and conqueror. Caesar himself, in the heat of battle, used it to define the enemy, the wild men beyond the known world. \n\nHe saw them as a shadow, a threat lurking on the edge of the map, a whisper of chaos in the ordered world he sought to build. A people of spears and war cries, their name a guttural sound, a challenge to the Roman world. Or perhaps, it's a word born of the spear itself, the \"ger\" that pierced the shields of the Roman legions. Or maybe from the ancient Irish, \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” a testament to their fierce voices in the echoing silence of the forests.\n\nTacitus, the Roman chronicler, saw something different. He saw a land untouched, a people untouched by the mingling of races, a wildness that he both feared and admired. He saw them as aboriginal, like the wind blowing through the barren plains, unyielding and untamed.\n\nAnd they were. The Germanic tribes, they moved like ghosts across the borders of the Roman world. They traded their furs and weapons, their skills as warriors, filling the ranks of the Roman legions. They were a shadow, a whisper on the wind, a force that could not be ignored.\n\n\nBut the Romans, for all their might, never truly conquered Germania. The land was too wild, the people too strong. They pushed and they pulled, they built walls and marched armies, but the spirit of Germania remained.\n\nAnd so it is today. The echoes of those ancient tribes still resonate in the heart of this nation. The shadow of Germania lingers, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, the wild heart can never be truly tamed.",
            "The bowl drained, a slow, sucking sound, leaving only the residue of what had been. I stared into its depths, mind a blank slate. No thought, no judgment, just the raw, unfiltered vision of the brown stain clinging to the porcelain. Like a child, I watched, mesmerized, as the water seeped away, revealing the truth.  \n\nOnce, I’d read about an artist who claimed to see the world differently. He spoke of a “frame,” a way to isolate the essence of a thing.  A bowl of fruit, a landscape, even a pile of shit, could be reduced to its barest elements. I tried to summon that vision now, to impose that frame on the scene before me. But the brown stain resisted. It was too much, too immediate, too visceral.  \n\nThey called it art, they called it creativity, but all I felt was the pulse of its ordinariness. Picasso and his blues, Monet and his green fields, the Italians and their riot of colors – they all seemed distant, unreal. This was my truth, my story. My brown moment.  \n\nMy hand reached for the handle, muscles tightening, a familiar ritual.  I squeezed, the porcelain cold beneath my grasp. The stain remained, a stubborn defiance. A second squeeze, a sharper jolt, and the handle slipped. The brown matter, a lump of flesh and fiber, refused to yield.  \n\nThe mop lay abandoned, a pool of pale green against the stark white tile.  My tie, a noose of cheap fabric, constricted my throat. I stared at the stain, a silent, simmering rage building within. It was a message, a challenge.  I would conquer it, reduce it, make it mine.  The toilet paper, a flimsy white shroud, beckoned. I reached for it, my hand plunging into the abyss, a grim specter in the porcelain purgatory.",
            "The road eats them young. These boys and girls, they climb in behind the wheel and become statistics. A cruel arithmetic of speed and inexperience. The doctors, they say the boy's mind ain't made yet. Still wet clay under the wheel, liable to crumble under pressure. It ain't just that, though.  It's the hunger, the need to prove something. They gotta show their peers they ain't afraid of nothin'.  A car becomes a cage of steel and glass where they think they're invincible. \n\nThe ones with the bright eyes and the reckless grins, they fill the passenger seats with their friends, and the laughter turns to screams faster'n a rattler strikes. The South, they got numbers too, they say. More metal and blood on the asphalt. More broken families and empty chairs.  \n\nThey try to make it safer, they do. These licenses, they call 'em provisional, like a trial run.  But that ain't the answer. It's a bandaid on a gaping wound.  The truth is, the young ones, they ain't ready. They ain't got the patience, the sense, the damn weight of the world on their shoulders. \n\nThere's a man, Zuckerman, says they crave the danger, the rush of it all. Like moths to a flame, they're drawn to the edge. And when you're chasing shadows, you're bound to fall.\n\nSo what do you do?  You wait. You let them grow.  Let the fire in their hearts cool a little.  Teach 'em respect for the road, for the metal they're piloting, for the lives they might take. \n\nLaws, they can help.  A nationwide thing, maybe.  No wheel for them till they're eighteen, or older.  Some more time behind the wheel with a grown man, learning the rhythm of the road, the whisper of the wind through the trees.\n\nWe need to save these kids. Before the road takes them.",
            "The library housed a darkness, thick and ancient, like the breath of the forgotten. I sifted through the Edison films, a flickering catalog of shadows. Fifteen trick films, they called them. Born of the crucible of 1895 to the nascent dawn of 1901. A conjuration of deceit, stitched together with the barest threads of editing. My task: to unravel their secrets, to map the poetics of illusion.\n\nMost danced to the same tune: confined within the proscenium's rigid embrace. No camera to wander, only a fixed gaze upon the stage of shadows. A stage inherited from the theatre, from vaudeville's flickering lights, from the hush of a magician's trick.  Figures moved in a prescribed dance, a back and forth, a waltz within the frame. Like Uncle Josh in that Spooky Hotel (1900), they entered from the right, their steps confined to the horizontal plane. They faded from view, but the camera remained unmoved, a silent sentinel guarding the artifice.\n\nThe proscenium's grip extended to the very length of the shots. Long shots, sometimes a medium's fleeting glimpse, but never the intimacy of a close-up. The audience, like the stage, demanded the whole, the entirety of the performance laid bare. No secrets hidden in the close embrace of a face, no intimate whispers in the shadows.\n\nEach trick film adhered to a rigid code: one thought, one film. A minute, perhaps less, depending on the cadence of the frames. A fleeting glimpse, a spark of wonder, then swallowed by the darkness.  A vaudeville routine, a fleeting enchantment, with little room for narrative's embrace.\n\nYet, deception can take many forms. What appears as one shot, a singular breath of illusion, might be woven from several threads. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) whispers of this. A closer look reveals the seams, the subtle shifts, the conjuration of a severed head. A single, unbroken illusion, but a tapestry of hidden truths.",
            "The man was John Taylor, a son of the soil, born of Caroline. A Republican through and through, he'd carved his life from the land, a life that bled into his politics. A farmer, sure, but more than that, a man who'd seen the soul of America in the furrowed fields and the sweat of honest labor. Freedom, that's what he fought for, freedom in the furrows, freedom in the ballot box, freedom in the very air he breathed. \n\nHe believed in the power of the simple life, a life untainted by the machinations of distant halls and the whispers of a grasping government.  He saw the young nation, fragile as a newborn fawn, and he knew it needed tending, not coddling. He saw the Constitution as a promise, a shield against the encroaching darkness of tyranny.  \n\nHe'd seen the world, seen the rot that festered in the hearts of men, the hunger for power that devoured reason and compassion. He knew that man was a creature of both light and shadow, capable of both great good and unspeakable evil. That's why he fought for a government bound by its own rules, a government that understood its place, a government that dared not tread too heavily on the delicate balance of liberty. \n\nHe'd seen men like his uncle, a man of the land, his hands calloused from years of honest labor, his eyes reflecting the wisdom of the fields.  His uncle, a man who understood the value of hard work and self-reliance, a man who knew the true meaning of freedom.  And he'd seen men who craved power, men who sought to control, to manipulate, to bend the will of others to their own selfish desires.\n\nHe knew the danger of unchecked ambition, the seductive allure of power, the slow creep of corruption. He fought against it, tooth and nail, with the fierce determination of a cornered lion, with the unwavering conviction of a man who knew the stakes.",
            "The logs, they fell off a cliff come the third month. Figure 17. Disheartening, it was. Hard to say why. Winter's grip tightens on a New England campus, see. Fewer folks peddling bikes, fewer folks walking. Makes sense. December, though, that's when the semester ends. Papers due, grades tallied, everyone scrabbling for an escape. Maybe the log just got lost in the shuffle.  \n\nThen there's the holidays, looming like a black cloud, swallowing up the month. Students gone, faculty scattered, the campus a ghost town. January rolls in, cold and empty, classes start again. Still, that February dip, that's a mystery.  \n\nMaybe it's just the way of things. A burst of fire at the start, then the embers die down. We tried to fan the flames with the Carpool Challenge, a blitz in March. Worked, too, submissions climbed back up. But the ebb and flow, the rhythm of it all, that's the challenge, see? Keeping the thing alive when the natural pulse weakens, and when holidays and semesters break the flow. \n\nAnother thing, people, they like their cars. It's freedom, independence, the open road. It's ingrained in us. You gotta offer something to get them to break free. Gift cards, we gave out plenty. Restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage or two. Local bookstore, some national chains thrown in. Would something bigger have worked? A bike, maybe? Or a hybrid, a real electric dream machine?  \n\nMaybe the bigger prizes would have kept the logs flowing. The cards, they were fine at first, but what if we'd upped the ante?

            "The wind picked up dust devils across the barren plain. It rattled the bones of a rusted hulk of a machine, a thing they called an ETF. A cage, some might say, holding promises of wealth, but at what cost?  It tracked a phantom, a shadow called an index, a collection of whispers promising growth. A slick way to gamble, they said, but the house always won.\n\nThis particular cage, they called it IHF. Inside, ten beasts, big and powerful, fuelled the market's hunger. 63.58% of the cage's contents they devoured, leaving a gnawing emptiness behind.  The boys, the educated ones, said a cage was better than the wild, safer, more predictable.  They pointed to numbers, to percentages, to the sleek, cold gleam of a balance sheet.\n\nBut what of the soul, the heart of the matter?  Could these cages, these fabricated beasts, ever truly capture the wildness, the unpredictable dance of the market? Could they truly offer a path to fortune, or were they just a gilded trap, a mirage in a desert of greed?\n\nThey crunched the numbers. They dissected the ten beasts, their strengths and weaknesses laid bare. They built a cage of their own, a smaller, more focused structure, a challenge to the IHF's supposed dominion.  They measured the risk, the reward, the cold, hard calculus of return.  But something was missing.\n\nThe wind howled, a mournful cry in the emptiness. The caged beasts stirred, their eyes gleaming with a cold, alien light.  The boys, lost in their calculations, failed to see the truth:  the market was not a game, not a puzzle to be solved. It was a living thing, a wild, unpredictable beast, forever beyond the reach of cages and charts.",
            "The land of dreams, a place Poe called Thulé, echoes with the ghost of Virgil's island, a place beyond the known world.  But Poe, a man steeped in the ink of German writers, knew a deeper well.  He drank deep from Goethe's well, a darkness mirroring his own.\n\nThis Thulé, it speaks of a kinship, a shared sorrow, a king mourning a queen in a world drained of color.  The King of Thulé, a man consumed by grief, shadows Poe's own demons, his own self-destruction mirrored in the goblet's final plunge into the sea.  Was it imitation? Or something more?  Arndt, a scholar of Poe's soul, saw the kinship, the echo of Goethe's words in Poe's own.\n\nGoethe, a titan of German literature, wove his own Thulé in the tapestry of Faust, a king's lament a symphony of despair.  A king's wife, gone, leaving behind only a goblet, a constant reminder of loss. The king drinks, drowns in his sorrow, until the cliffs themselves beckon, the sea a final embrace.  \n\nPoe, like a raven, circled these themes, his Thulé a bleak reflection of Goethe's.  There's a darkness in both, a hollowness that speaks to a shared human experience.  Poe, the American poet, found kinship in the darkness of a German soul, his own Thulé a testament to the universality of grief.\n\nHis references, though fleeting, are not random.  The Pit and the Pendulum, Dream-Land, echoes of Thulé reverberate, a haunting reminder of the shared human experience of loss and despair.\n\nAnd what of Tennyson?  A bridge between worlds, a literary kinship that bound Poe to Goethe's legacy.",

But Malice. That's the word. That's what she needs to prove.  Willful disregard. A heart cold as the applesauce in the aisle.\n\nThe law, it says, a man can't just shrug off responsibility.

Four years, maybe more, since I sat in that classroom, the dust of argument clinging to the air like the scent of burnt oil. Islam. They called it hostile.  Neighbors with eyes cast down, whispers in the aisles.  But the air’s changed now, the world’s shifted. They whisper different things. Tolerance, they call it.  A word that tastes like ash in the mouth. \n\nThe Prophet’s story, it claws at the edges of the mind. A man built up like a monument, yet the stones whisper of a different man.  The one they tell me about, the one they try to sell you, is a martyr, misunderstood, humble. A shepherd leading sheep to a green pasture, not a king forcing them to kneel.  A man who called on God in the desert, not a storm that swept across the land, leaving only silence and obedience in its wake. \n\nThey say he multiplied the mutton, the milk, feeding forty men with a handful of scraps.  A trick of the light, they say.  But the echoes of another man’s miracle linger, a shadow cast long across the years.  The same gesture, the same hunger for something more, something beyond the desert.  It’s a theft, a pale imitation, a whisper in the wind trying to drown out the roar.\n\nAnd the whispers of the faithful. Stories passed from hand to hand, each one a step further from the truth.  They say they heard it from the one who heard it from the one who saw it. The truth, they say, is in the echo.  But echoes fade, and what remains is only the silence, a silence that screams.\n\nThe man they try to paint as gentle, as wise, the man they build into a god, his hands stained with blood, his eyes cold and hard.  History whispers a different truth, a truth they try to bury under mountains of sand.  Do the faithful know, do they truly know, the man they worship?  Or are they blind to the shadow that follows him, the shadow that falls over all he touches?",
            "The dust of the gospel settles. The teachings of the man from Nazareth, the words spoken on a hill, lost in the echoes of the centuries. What remained, what blossomed, bore little resemblance to the seed.  A creeping vine, strangling the trunk, twisting the limbs, growing fat on the fruits of dogma and creed.  \n\nThey say the world is changing, turning its face toward the light.  But the light it seeks is a pale reflection, a flickering flame compared to the sun.  The old ways, the rigid pews, the whispered prayers, these cling to the faithful like barnacles to a ship, heavy with the weight of tradition. But the tide is turning. A whisper in the wind, a rustle in the leaves, a yearning for something more.\n\nThey will remember.  The forgotten words, the simple truths, the stark reality of the man and his message. The layers will peel away, the gloss of centuries stripped bare. Back to the bones, back to the source. A slow, inexorable tide, dragging the church back to the shore of its origins.\n\nAnd the church, the institution, the towering edifice, will lead the way. A shepherd guiding its flock, herding them back to the fold.  But the fold will be different. No longer a patchwork of sects and denominations, but a single, unified body, bound by the thread of the original message.\n\nThis is the way of history.  The pendulum swings.  The empires fall.  The tides turn.  Just as the Roman legions once marched on Jerusalem, so too will the spirit of the Nazarene march on the world.  Just as the chains of slavery were broken, so too will the chains of dogma be shattered.  \n\nIt will be a time of reckoning. A time of stripping away the layers, the embellishments, the accretions of time.  A time of returning to the wellspring, to the source, to the man who spoke of love and forgiveness and a kingdom not of this world.   \n\nWhat remains then?  The word.  The spirit.

The factories, black monoliths against the dying light, spewed their smoke like a serpent's breath, staining the sky a sickly gray. Their owners, men with hearts as black as the coal dust that clung to their fingers, cared only for the cold, hard currency that flowed from the endless grind. They saw their workers not as men, but as cogs in a machine, expendable parts to be ground down and discarded.\n\nSinclair's words hung in the air, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A river of smoke, a river of despair.

Long hours, for meager pay, in conditions that would choke the life out of a lesser breed.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"  \n\nThey were trapped, these souls, in a system designed to keep them down. No safety net, no voice, no hope. The factories loomed over them, a constant threat, their gears grinding out a rhythm of misery. The cries of the injured, the stench of the slaughterhouse, the dust that settled in the lungs and filled the eyes - it was a living hell, and they were condemned to walk its paths.\n\nSinclair's words echoed again, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"\n\nThey were slaves, these workers, bound by chains of circumstance, their humanity eroded by the relentless grinding of the machine. They dreamed of escape, of a world where men were valued for more than their sweat and toil, but that dream seemed as distant as the stars.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything.  A white dust, a gray dust, sifting through the air like whispers of a forgotten time. Fitzgerald knew this, understood the way colors could settle on a soul, etch themselves into the very fabric of a story.  He used them like brushstrokes, painting meaning onto canvas. White, for the brittle sheen of wealth, the cold gleam of unfulfilled desire. Gray, for the faded edges of dreams, the hollow ache of longing.  \n\nHe draped them on Daisy like a shroud, the white of her dress a stark beacon against the ash-gray backdrop of her life. White, the color of a porcelain doll, fragile and beautiful, yet empty inside. White, the color of a lie, a facade carefully constructed to conceal the truth. And gray, the color of her past, the faded memories of a girlhood spent chasing shadows.\n\nHe saw it in the way she moved, a ghost in white slipping through the gaudy rooms of Gatsby's parties. He saw it in the way her voice, once vibrant, now held a brittle edge, a whisper of forgotten promises. \n\nFitzgerald, he knew the power of color.  He knew how to make it sing, to make it bleed, to make it whisper stories of hope and despair. He used it to build Gatsby's world, a world of shimmering gold and lurid reds, a world built on illusions and fueled by a desperate longing for something more.",
            "The sun beat down on the dust of San Diego County, baking the earth hard.  The land was thirsty, but it bore fruit nonetheless. Tomatoes fat and red, citrus heavy with juice, greens bright and crisp.  Squash and broccoli, herbs and peaches, lemons clinging to the trees. Berries plump, honey thick in the comb, peppers fiery and sweet. This was a land of plenty, but the bounty came at a cost.  \n\nThe people of San Diego craved the pureness of it, the absence of taint, the honest taste of the earth.  They sought out the organic, the unadulterated, the soul of the food itself. Waiting lists stretched long for the bounty of the local farms, their baskets filled with organic eggs and milk. These farmers, they walked a different path, a harder path, but one that promised more than just profit.\n\nThey spoke of biodiversity, of the land whispering back to them in the rustle of leaves and the flight of birds. They spoke of the silence after the spray, the return of the creatures that had fled the poisons.  But the land, it was unforgiving. The weeds grew thick, the pests came ravenous. Every inch required tending, every harvest a struggle.  Scale was a weapon the big farms wielded, efficiency their shield. But here, in the heart of it all, the small farmer toiled, sweat on their brow, hope in their heart.\n\nThis land, it held a story. A story of Native hands that had tilled it for generations, of cattle that grazed beneath the sun, of wood cutters who brought forth the fire.  Now, a new chapter was unfolding.\n\n\nA parcel of land near Potrero, 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, whispered its own secrets. The Cleveland National Forest pressed close, a silent observer. The air hummed with the murmur of life, the cries of unseen birds, the rustle of creatures hidden in the shadows. This was a place of convergence, where the wild met the cultivated, where the past and present intertwined.\n\n\nHere, the future of farming was being written, a delicate balance between profit and preservation. This was the story of a landowner seeking guidance, a farmer seeking solace, a land seeking renewal.  This was a story of hope.",
            "The dust of a bargain hangs heavy in the air, heavier than the smoke from a dying fire. Culture, you see, ain't a thing you can point to. It's a ghost, a shadow, a way of seeing the world that clings to a man like a shroud. To say all Russians are stubborn, or all Japanese are accommodating, that's to mistake the echo for the song. \n\nIt's in the way a man looks at you, in the silence he holds, in the way his hand rests on the table. It's the weight of his ancestors, the stories whispered down through generations, the unspoken rules that bind them. \n\nTo walk into that, you gotta shed your own skin. You gotta see the world through their eyes, with their ghosts at your shoulder.  You can't judge it, you can't change it, you can only learn to dance with it. Especially when you're on shaky ground, when your hand's not the strongest at the table.\n\nA company, it's a culture too, a different kind of ghost. Some wear their rules like armor, others let them drift like smoke. The way they dress, the words they choose, the way they move, it all whispers a story. Some believe in feeding the poor, others only the bottom line. \n\nBut beneath it all, there's the values. Those are the bones, the heart of the matter. Why do they do what they do? What do they hold dear?\n\nA man who values face won't break it, even at the cost of a deal. A man who values the deal will drive hard, until the last drop of blood is squeezed out.\n\nLearn those things, and you'll get further than any textbook could tell you. But remember, even the best lesson book can't teach you the language of a man's soul.",
            "The fool, he says in his heart, there is no God. A saying from the Psalms, a seed planted in the stony ground of Anselm's proof. Both men, Anselm and Aquinas, they wrestle with the same beast, the same God, the same question of faith and reason. To understand their struggle, we must first accept their premise: God, the God of scripture, the God of their own making, exists. A God who whispers in the dark corners of the mind, a God whose fingerprints are etched on the fabric of the world.  \n\nAnselm, he digs deep within, searching for the echo of the divine in the chambers of the soul. God is a thought, a concept so perfect, so complete, that to deny his existence is to deny the very act of thinking itself.  It's a logic born of the heart, a faith whispered in the silence of introspection.  He doesn't need the cold steel of reason, the hard evidence of the senses. His God is a fire in the soul, a truth known before it's spoken.\n\nAquinas, he walks a different path, a path paved with logic and observation. He looks to the world, to the order and beauty that surrounds him, and sees the hand of a creator.  In the changing seasons, the intricate dance of life and death, he sees the signature of a craftsman, a master architect. He seeks proof in the tangible, in the observable, in the patterns that weave the tapestry of existence.\n\nBut do either of these men truly touch the heart of the matter? Does Anselm's faith-based reasoning truly offer a satisfying answer, or does it simply reaffirm what is already known? Does Aquinas's reliance on reason, on the tangible world, leave room for the mystery, the ineffable, the spark of the divine that transcends the grasp of logic?  Both offer glimpses, fragments of a larger truth, but neither, perhaps, holds the full key to the mystery of God.  The fool may indeed say there is no God, but the wise man knows that the search itself, the yearning for something beyond the mundane, is perhaps the truest testament to the divine.",
            "The wind scoured the plains. A prince, they called him, though he knew no king.  He was born in the dust of a time long gone, a time before the whispers of a man called Buddha had risen to fill the empty valleys of the world.  He was born into a world of pain, a world of endless wanting, a world that clung to things like a drowning man to a raft. A world he would come to abandon.  He’d trade the silks and the silver for the ragged cloth of a wandering man, the jeweled throne for the silence of the mountains. He’d walk barefoot on the ash of a world consumed by its own desires.\n\nHe’d come to see it all, the endless churn of birth and death, the grasping at shadows, the clinging to fleeting things. He saw the suffering etched on the faces of men, the fear that gnawed at their hearts, the emptiness that echoed in their souls. He saw the truth of it all, the truth that lay hidden beneath the shimmering layers of illusion. \n\nHe saw it and he knew. He knew the world was a fever dream, a transient flicker in the vast darkness. And he knew the way out.\n\nThey called him Buddha, the Awakened One, after he’d walked the path, stripped bare the layers of self, and seen with the eyes of truth.  He spoke of the four noble truths, the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the truth of the path to its end.\n\nThe world, slow to understand, clung to the old ways. They built temples and shrines, carved his words into stone, and turned his teachings into a religion. They called it Theravada, the way of the elders, though the elders had forgotten the echo of his voice, the tremor in his hand as he pointed to the way.\n\nThe water-cutting ceremony, they said, was a tradition, a way to honor him. But it was a shadow, a pale imitation of the truth he’d spoken.  The rituals, the chants, the offerings, they were all just dust motes dancing in the sun, unable to pierce the veil of ignorance.\n\nThe world, they say, changes. And so did the religion.  Forces, both gentle and harsh, both internal and external, shaped the tree, bending its branches, twisting its roots. Some sought to preserve the essence of the Buddha’s teachings, others to mold them to their own needs.  The community, both those who lived in the monasteries and those who walked the world, they all changed. They clung to the words, but the meaning, the spark of recognition, that flickered and dimmed.",
            "The sun beat down on the dust, baking the earth the color of bone.  Two nations, the United States and Mexico, locked in a dance of shadows.  Fifty-seven years they circled each other, a rivalry older than the cottonwood trees along the Rio Grande. From the first shot of the Texas Revolution in '36 to the dying embers of the First World War, the air crackled with tension. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) say it was a high-water mark of hate, a war painted in the blood of both people. The Mexican-American War, a thirsty beast that swallowed Texas and the Southwest, leaving a bitterness that lingered like the smell of smoke.\n\nBut it wasn't just about land. It was a clash of souls, a tangle of roots reaching deep into the earth. Religion, culture, tradition - all ground to dust in the mill of ambition.  Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31) called it a collision of interests, a dance of devils that whispered promises of power.\n\nThis wasn't a new song. Borders, like scars, hold the memory of old wounds.  Nations born in the shadow of their neighbors, fighting for space and sustenance.  Pletcher (1977, p. 41) saw it in Mexico and Cuba, two thorns in the side of the American eagle.  He saw it in their eyes, the same hunger, the same fear, the same yearning for something more.\n\nThe ghosts of Spain and England haunted the land, their whispers weaving a tapestry of distrust.  Frahm (2001, p. 86) spoke of the fear of the other, the dark stain of Catholicism and monarchy, a threat to the very soul of America. It was a cold war waged in the name of God, a battle for hearts and minds.\n\nBorders bled, towns burned, and men died.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) cataloged 17 clashes, each a testament to the fragile peace.  Bands of desperados roamed, leaving trails of blood and misery in their wake.  Schmitt (1974, p. 97) saw it as a struggle for control, a game of chess played with lives.\n\nBut the tide turned.   Mexico, weakened and weary, found itself bowing to the will of its northern neighbor.  Schmitt (1974, p. 109) explained it as a shift in focus, a hunger for dollars replacing the thirst for land.  The war ended, not with a bang, but a whimper. A new kind of dance began, one of dependence and exploitation. The dust settled, but the memories lingered, etched in the hearts of two nations forever bound by their shared past.",
            "The illness came sudden as a winter storm, fifteen years gone now.  A darkness fell, stole the light from my world.  Nurse I was, back then.  Thought I'd chosen it safe, secure.  A girl needs that, I reckoned, when the world ain't built for her kind.  \"Always a need for nurses,\" they'd say, \"sick folk there'll always be.\" So, I did it.  Though the scientist in me yearned, the journalist, maybe both. Nurse it was.\n\nBut there I was, forty-six and alone, bank account thinner'n a ghost's prayer, body broken. Fifteen years on disability now, Social Security my only shield against the cold. Nothing left, not a dime, not a trinket. I scrape by, but every day's a fight, a claw at the edge of something vast and hungry.\n\nNothing's certain anymore, save this:  I wouldn't have made it these years without the folks who held me up, family and friends, a few good souls.  When the world turns dark, you find out who's standing beside you.\n\nSee, life's full of emergencies, small and big.  No use pretending they won't come. You can plan, you can prepare, but some things are too big, too awful to face alone.\n\nThey talk 'bout rugged individualism, 'bout how that built this country.  But the truth is, the folks who crossed the plains, who carved this land, they did it with something more than grit.  It was compassion, respect, helping hand.  Wagon trains, they didn't make it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be ready.  I am.  Got my kits, my supplies, my candles and matches.  If you've the land, grow your own food, preserve it.  A wood stove, good in a pinch, if you ain't livin' in a box. But don't forget, while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors.  That's the real strength, the kind that lasts.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, a rasping breath across the bones of the world. It whispered through the dust, carrying the faint scent of things lost, of growth and decay, of the slow, relentless march of time. How did life, this fragile thing, this tapestry of bone and blood and sinew, come to be shaped as it is? What unseen hand guided the coil of the shell, the curve of the spine, the intricate dance of the genes? \n\nThompson, back in the sway of a bygone era, spoke of the zoologist's limited grasp on the language of life. But now, in this time of shadowed knowledge, the whisperings of mathematics begin to weave a new understanding. We see echoes of this language in the spiral of the mollusk, in the slow, unfolding drama of its shell.\n\nWe take the shell, this vessel of memory and history, and hold it to the light. Each whorl, a whisper of a moment, a testament to the journey through time. The columella, a silent guide, marking the path through the labyrinthine spaces of growth.  The suture, a scar, a seam, where one moment bleeds into the next.  \n\nWe map these whispers, these echoes, with the cold precision of numbers. We seek to understand the boundaries of possibility, the constraints that shape the dance of life.  And in the depths of this mathematical ocean, we glimpse the hidden currents, the forces that sculpt the forms of existence.\n\nAnd though the answers may lie beyond our grasp, the journey itself is a revelation. In the spiraling shell, in the whisper of the wind, we see a reflection of our own unfolding, our own journey through the vast, chaotic symphony of being.",
            "The breath of death hung heavy over Indonesia.  The babes and the mothers, they clung to the edge of the grave.  For ten long years, the numbers had sat like a tombstone, unchanging, unyielding.  The country, it danced with the specter of progress, a waltz with the Millennium's phantom promises.  Water and sanitation, they'd tamed those beasts, but the children, the mothers, their plight remained a festering wound.  \n\nThey'd coaxed more births under the watchful eye of a healer, a midwife's hand or a doctor's touch.  Seventy-two percent, they boasted, but the numbers whispered a lie.  Those midwives, they held the thread of life, but their hands were not strong enough to mend the fabric when it tore.  Hemorrhage, the silent killer, stalked the shadowed corners of their progress.\n\nEven the children, the scourges of diarrhea, grew less likely to find a hand to lift them from the brink.  Postnatal care, a whisper lost in the wind, a promise unkept.\n\nThe steel of the scalpel, it was a rare sight, a mere 4% of the births it graced.  A tale of two cities it painted, however.  In the concrete jungles, the c-section a common friend, 7% of them, but in the endless fields, it was a phantom, a ghost at 2%.  The city walls, they held the cure, the promise, leaving the countryside to wither.  And the poor, their hands empty, their pockets lighter, they were left to wallow in despair, their 27% gap a chasm too wide to cross.\n\nSo what now?  Should they patch the holes, stitch the wounds, with a thousand programs, each a band-aid on a broken body?  Or should they mend the very bones of the system, the heart that pulsed with life?  The siren song of quick fixes, they were tempting, seductive.  But the shadows danced, whispering of unintended consequences.  To pour all their might into one, what of the others?  The rustle of neglected needs, the silent cries of forgotten corners.\n\nThey stood at a crossroads, the weight of a nation on their shoulders.  To heal the land, they must first heal the system, mend the cracks that ran deep.  Only then could they truly hope to banish the specter of death.",
            "The stifling weight of Victorian detail, the relentless scrutiny of the aristocracy, these things suffocate the soul. It is in the shadows, in the whispers of the uncanny, that true life unfurls. Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, dare to break free from the gilded cage of convention, venturing into the darkness, illuminating the hidden depths of the human heart. Both weave tales spun with mystery and the strange, a departure from the predictable norms of their time, and in this departure, they find a depth of characterization, a searing glimpse into the tangled webs of motive and emotion. \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels plumb the depths of the subconscious through dreams, or states that mirror them, though their purpose and form differ. In *Oliver Twist*, these surreal experiences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his nascent understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if caught in a nightmare, while he struggles to find help. The passage underscores his helplessness, the grip of despair tightening around him. His senses are numb, he doesn't perceive the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; the pain is a constant ache, a companion to his fear rather than a sudden shock. The question arises: whose will has orchestrated his misfortune? Certainly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little to no control, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome, even when his life hangs in the balance. This defeat is palpable, a creeping shadow cast by Fagin, who seems to be breaking his spirit, forcing him to accept this bleakness, stealing his ability to resist. \n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "The boy, Adrian, he was a puzzle. A whisper of a thing, skinny as a rail, with eyes that held the wisdom of a man twice his age.  He spoke English with the fluency of a native, yet the alphabet, it was a labyrinth to him. Letters danced and jumbled, some pronouncements struck true, others like a hammer blow to a brittle glass. I worked with him after school, pouring over words, trying to coax meaning from the chaos. Years I'd spent learning the craft of language, but this, this was different.  \n\nOne day, his mother came to the program. Her face, etched with worry, spoke a language I understood better than any tongue. She made no sound, only the gesture of a bird caught in a net, wings beating uselessly against the bars. I knew then. He knew the words, the sounds, the rhythm. But the alphabet, that was foreign. A map uncharted, a sky without stars.\n\nIt was a slow awakening, a dawning in the gray. We talked, or rather,  I tried to talk, with broken Spanish, her hands my bridge to understanding. Adrian, he watched, his eyes absorbing it all, like a sponge drawing in the rain.\n\nThat story, it hangs over me still, a reminder of the walls we build, the chasms we create.  It's a problem we face here, in this land of many tongues. Not just the language barrier, but the unseen barriers, the assumptions we make, the stories we tell ourselves. \n\nThere are no easy solutions, no silver bullets. Dual language programs, they are a start, a seed in the dry earth. But they need nurturing, they need time, they need the understanding that true education is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It's a journey, a dance, a conversation that never ends.",
            "The rain hammered on the tin roof, a drumbeat against the silence. We sat on the porch,  the wood slick beneath our hands, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and pine.  He'd been thinner lately, his shoulders slumped as if the weight of the world had settled there. He didn't look up when I asked about his favorite bird. Just stared out at the rain-soaked yard, a look in his eyes that was both searching and lost.  \n\n\"A cardinal,\" he finally said, his voice a rasp. \n\nI remember thinking how the word seemed to hang in the air, heavy with meaning. Like a prayer unspoken. We smoked our cigarettes, the smoke curling up into the gray sky, each pull a silent question mark. We were both searching for something, but neither of us knew what.\n\nThe world, he'd say sometimes, is a cruel and indifferent place. But there's still beauty in it, he'd say, if you know where to look. I'd look at him, at the lines etched on his face, the way his eyes seemed to hold the weight of a thousand stories, and wonder if he truly believed it himself.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my birthday. The doctors had said he had weeks, maybe months, but he didn't last that long. The chemo, the radiation, it just kept him tethered to this world, prolonging the inevitable. What God, I thought, would allow such suffering? I didn't pray. God had stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became. So I didn't go.\n\nThey didn't even call me. \n\nI curled up in my bed, the sheets pulling tight around me, and waited for the news.  I waited for the final curtain to fall on a life that had already faded.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" a term that rings hollow like a bell in a tomb, is, as Ian Watt tells it, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" It's been kicked down, praised up, called shallow, called sublime. Horace Walpole, the man who birthed the thing in \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he took the old tales, the ruins and the ghosts, and shoved them into the new shape of the novel. He wanted \"A Gothic Story,\" he declared. He wanted to grab at the reader's throat and whisper of the dark things hidden in the heart of the world.\n\n\"Gothic,\" that word, it had always been a whisper of the past, a shadow on the edges of the world. It meant old, it meant crude, it meant the things that civilization had left behind. But Walpole, he saw something in that shadow, something that scared and thrilled him. He took the old theatrics, the crumbling castles and howling winds, and he put them into a new skin, a skin of words that allowed the reader to see the darkness in their own minds. That's the thing about Gothic, it's always both old and new, it's the echo of a heartbeat in the darkness.\n\nOne of the things that stirs in the darkness of Gothic is the idea of chivalry. The old knights, the brave heroes of a forgotten time, they are there, their swords rusted but their spirits burning. Walpole, he saw the world falling apart around him, the old ways crumbling, the new ways cold and hard. He looked at the knights of old, at their honor and their courage, and he saw a reflection of something lost. He wanted to bring that back, to remind people of the good that might still be there.\n\nTake Frederic, for instance. He's the prince, the hero, the man who has seen suffering and loss. He's everything a knight should be, and more. The reader sees him, not just as a character, but as a symbol, a reminder of what might have been.\n\nWalpole, he was a man of his time, a man who saw the world changing too fast. He saw the old ways dying, and he wanted to hold onto something, something real, something true. And so he wrote his Gothic story, a story of shadows and darkness, but also a story of hope, a story of the enduring power of the human spirit.",
            "The dust of things. That's what it all boils down to. A chain of them, strung out like beads on a thread. From the call of need, the wanting of a customer, back through the bones of the earth itself, to the raw seed of an idea. They call it supply chain, this whole business. A grand phrase for something as plain as hunger.  \n\nIt started back in '82, some man named Oliver. Said it was all about planning, driving the gears of it all to keep the wants of men fed.  Six strands, he laid it out. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the place of it all, the moving of it, and the whispers of information. All tied together like a knot, hard to pull apart.\n\nProduction first. The heart of it.  Where the raw stuff is turned to something you can hold. Managers, they sit like vultures over the market, watching what men crave. What they need, what they'll steal, what they'll pay good coin for. Then comes the making.  The how and the when, the where and the why.  The world is a factory now, churning out things men don't even know they need. More than they need. Until the shelves are full and the warehouses overflow, and the dust settles on the things men forgot.\n\nThen comes the supply. The veins that carry the blood of the whole thing.  Finding the places, the hands, the tools to make it all work. Sometimes it's done in-house, a family secret, passed down through generations. Sometimes it's given away, outsourced to strangers in faraway lands. All for the sake of speed, of keeping the wheels turning.\n\nThe rest follow.  Inventory, a pile of promises, waiting to be fulfilled. Location, a dance of logistics, finding the right place for the right thing at the right time. Transportation, the groaning of trucks and trains, the clatter of ships, the endless movement of things. And finally, information, the whispered secrets that bind it all together. A constant flow of data, keeping track of what's where, what's needed, what's coming next.\n\nBut it's all dust in the end.  The things we make, the things we buy, they all fade away. Left behind are the bones of the chain, the empty trucks, the silent factories.  And the dust settles.",

On the cardboard, scrawled in a shaky hand, the words cut like a blade: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nBurma. A name that clung to the tongue like ash. A country choked by a regime born of iron and blood, a junta that had seized power in a swift, brutal coup, silencing dissent for decades. In 2007, the saffron robes of monks had bled crimson, staining the streets of Rangoon. A silent uprising, a whispered rebellion, drowned in the echoing drums of military might.  They called it The Saffron Revolution, a fragile flame flickering against the suffocating darkness.\n\nJournalists vanished, their cameras silenced.  Nagai, the Japanese photographer, a victim of the junta's savage indifference, left a silent testament to the truth they sought to bury.  The official count spoke of 13 dead, a meager offering to appease a world that refused to see. But Colonel Hla Win, a whisper from the shadows, spoke of bodies piled high, thousands swallowed by the earth, their cries swallowed by the dust.\n\nThis was not new. The hunger for power, the insatiable thirst for control, a disease that festered in the heart of man.  From the Caesars, who draped themselves in the mantle of divinity, to the emperors of Japan, their divine mandate stained with the blood of dissent, to the presidents who whispered in the dark with men like Haggard, the cycle of repression spun its grim tapestry.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000 lost souls, drowned out by the official count of 200-300. Rwanda, a nation fractured by hate, where the drums of genocide echoed through the valleys, the stench of blood clinging to the wind.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare spun from twisted ideology, where millions perished, their ashes scattered by the winds of tyranny.\n\nThe sign swayed, a silent plea in a world deaf to its cries.  A stark reminder that the shadows of history loom long, and the fight for freedom is a perpetual battle.",

Each note he wrote, each phrase he crafted was a brushstroke, meant to bring out the light in their playing. They weren't just musicians, they were souls given voice. He gave them the space to sing, to soar, to bleed their hearts out onto the stage. \n\nAnd the sound that came out, it wasn't just jazz. It was a language older than words, a rhythm that spoke to the bone, a story whispered across generations. Creole Love Call, that was a taste of it.  The voice, it wasn't singing, it was a raw instrument, a cry from the soul. The trumpet, it wailed like a lost lover, and the clarinet, it danced like a ghost. \n\nHe built his world with sound, brick by brick, note by note.  He was a magician, conjuring worlds from thin air, and his orchestra, his band of brothers, they were his instruments, his tools, his family. \n\nAnd when they played, they didn't just play music. They played life.  They played love, and loss, and hope, and despair. They played the human condition, laid bare.",
            "The want had always been there, a hollow ache in her gut. A hunger that no amount of clothes or trinkets could fill. It began when she was fourteen, a whisper in the shadows of adolescence, and three years later, at seventeen, it still gnawed at her. It wasn't things she craved anymore, but something more. Someone. Yet, the boys who came around, stumbling over clumsy gestures and awkward words, held no allure. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life without leaving a trace. She'd spent years dissecting this strange emptiness, searching for the root of it, but the answers remained elusive. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions, her desires a constant, unsettling presence.\n\nHome was usually a place of quietude, a haven of calm. Her parents, weathered souls with a gentle equilibrium, rarely raised their voices, their disagreements as rare as a summer rain. The only discordant note was her own, a vibrant melody of independence that sometimes clashed with their placid rhythms. She was the storm in their gentle world, a whirlwind of energy and spirit, a force that drew people to her like moths to a flame.\n\n\nBut this day, the air was thick with tension. She drifted from room to room, seeking inspiration, a spark to ignite her soul, when a piercing cry shattered the silence. It was her mother, her voice trembling with pain. Panic surged like a tidal wave. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" she cried, rushing to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest. \n\nThere, on the floor, was her mother, clutching her side, her face contorted in agony. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she gasped, her words a strained whisper. \"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice resolute, \"tell me where to pick you up.\" \n\nHer mother weakly directed her, and the daughter, her own strength augmented by fierce love and necessity, lifted her mother into her arms, carrying her to the car. She cradled her mother in the backseat, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, and drove with a speed that bordered on reckless.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the hushed murmur of voices washed over her as she rushed her mother into the hospital. Fear threatened to engulf her, but she pushed it down, her focus narrowed to a single point: her mother's wellbeing. She found a nurse, her voice trembling, \"Please, help her!\" \n\nHer mother was whisked away, examined, and her daughter was left to wait, her anxiety a tangible presence in the air. \n\nLater, the doctor emerged, his face grave. Her mother, he explained, had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase on a high shelf.",
            "The wind scoured the plains, dry and unforgiving.  A sun bleached the world bone white, a sun that spoke of long days and long nights, and the slow, inexorable march of time. This was the land where the heart, like a worn-out flint, ground down to dust against the endless stretch of days. It was here, in this desolate expanse, that they sought the solace of the aMed, a way of life as ancient as the land itself. \n\nThey spoke of it in hushed tones, this aMed, a diet born from the dust and the sun, a way of finding sustenance in a world stripped bare. It was a pact with the earth, a recognition of the balance between what was given and what was taken. More than just food, it was a philosophy, a ritual of consumption, a quiet defiance against the encroaching silence.\n\nThese women, daughters of the dust themselves, they knew this truth. They had tasted the bitter sting of the desert, felt the sun beat down upon their backs, their skin taut and weathered like old leather. They had watched their kin wither and fall prey to the silent hunger that stalked the land.\n\nThe aMed became their shield, a bulwark against the creeping despair. It spoke of abundance in the face of scarcity, of life blooming in the barren cracks of existence. It was a way to honor the earth, to return to the rhythms of the seasons, to find solace in the simple act of nourishment.\n\nThey spoke of it in numbers, these women, these disciples of the aMed. They measured it in points, in ratios, in the meticulous accounting of grains and greens, of fish and fats. They documented their devotion in notebooks bound with twine, their voices a whisper against the wind.\n\nThey followed the aMed with a solemn determination, a quiet faith that could only exist in the face of relentless hardship. They knew that the path ahead was long, that the desert held its own cruel truths. But they held fast to their belief, their aMed a flickering ember in the vast darkness.",
            "The country coughed, choked on its own dust. 2007. The year the bones of the American dream cracked. The jobs, the houses, the promises – all turned to ash in the wind. Banks, fat and bloated, collapsed like rancid meat in the sun. Corporations, once as tall as the pines, fell like dry timber. The air hung thick with the scent of rot.\n\nThey tell you it was greed, these men in suits with their slick tongues and empty eyes. They whisper about sub-prime loans, CDOs, CDSs – words like tombstones marking the graves of good sense. But it was more than that. It was a sickness, a rot in the heart of the nation. A hunger for something more, something bigger, that devoured everything in its path.\n\nClinton, they say, set the stage. He wanted to be remembered, to leave his mark on the world. So he loosened the reins, let the wolves into the henhouse. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, puppets dancing to the tune of Wall Street, repackaged the poison, sold it as salvation.\n\nAnd the people, they bought it. They poured their hopes and dreams into these flimsy promises, these houses built on sand. They believed in the American dream, in the myth that everyone could have a piece of the pie. But the pie was a lie, a thin crust hiding a hollow center.\n\nThe bubble burst, slow at first, then with the force of a hurricane. The houses, the jobs, the dreams – all shattered. The economy, the world itself, teetered on the brink.\n\nWe are left picking up the pieces, trying to rebuild from the ashes. But the wounds run deep. The scars of greed and avarice are etched into the very fabric of our nation. The question is, can we learn from this? Can we resist the siren song of easy riches, the lure of quick profits? Or are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes, to fall again into the abyss?",
            "The rusted swing set creaked in the wind, a lonely metronome marking the passage of time in this forgotten corner of the world.  It was the kind of place where stories went to die, swallowed by dust and the weight of silence.  Not a good place for exposition, not a place for long winded tales of \"how things were\" or \"how they came to be.\"  Here, stories were hard-won, snatched from the jaws of oblivion, like a scrap of meat from a predator's maw.\n\nYou see, folks in these parts learned early on that the world didn't care for pleasantries.  It didn't reward flowery language or elaborate backstories.  It demanded grit, demanded action, demanded you show, not tell. \n\nTake that hero of yours, that woman with the tragic past.  Don't just tell me she loved her husband.  Let me see it in the way she clutches a faded photograph, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips as she traces the outline of his face.  Let me hear it in the tremor of her voice when she speaks his name, a whisper that echoes with the weight of a thousand unspoken words.\n\nDon't dump a laundry list of facts about her life onto my lap.  Weave it into the fabric of the story, let it unfold like a tapestry, thread by thread, revelation by revelation.  Let me see the scars of her past etched upon her soul, the way her eyes flinch at the sound of a sudden noise, the tightness in her grip on the worn handle of her purse.\n\nBecause in this world, words are precious, each one a bullet fired from a loaded gun.  Every sentence should count, every paragraph should move the story forward, every scene should leave a mark.  \n\nSo, my friend, ditch the exposition.  Embrace the silence.  Let the story breathe.  And show me what you've got.",
            "The air hung thick with the hum of the news. Two faces from Columbus stared out from the screen. The first, a man named Shad Hostettler, his eyes hollow pits in a face marred by something feral. They called it a \"stabbing,\" an unseemly word for the violence that had drenched Ashley, Ohio. Two minutes, that's all they gave him. A fleeting glimpse of evil in the flickering light.\n\nThe next face, nameless, belonged to a boy named Travis Buyers. Eighteen years old, they said, shot down in the shadows of Sharon Woods. The SWAT team, they said, was searching for answers. But the boy's story, it seemed, was lost in the static. A black boy, a black neighborhood, a life extinguished with little more than a flicker in the news cycle. \n\nThe world moved on.\n\nA story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber whisper of death, a five-thousand-dollar bounty for whispers of the shooter's name. The rain, they said, would come. Thunderstorms, they said, but the forecast was a cold comfort in the face of such violence.\n\nThen a story of a robbery, a man described with a chilling attention to detail: dark-skinned, black as night, a hoodie pulled tight against the darkness. They lingered on the details, as if the color of his skin was the most important thing they could tell you.\n\nRene Rodriguez, they said, a name that echoed in the empty room. A Texas drug kingpin, sentenced to \"300\" months, they said, a number that hung in the air like a death sentence. Hispanic, they said, as if his heritage was some kind of explanation.",
            "The blood ties, they bind. A knot that won't loosen, no matter the strain. Brother to brother, a connection forged in fire and shadow. Love, sure, but also the sharp edges of envy, the clawing need to be better, to be first. They see themselves in each other, not the mask they wear for the world, but the raw truth beneath. The kind of truth that cuts deep, a truth that bleeds. \n\nIt's in the hard times, when the world turns cold and the bones ache, that this bond reveals its true face. A face that can be both beautiful and terrible, a face that holds the weight of the past and the promise of the future.  \n\nThis is the story the ibis tells, a story of two boys, their lives intertwined like the roots of the ancient oaks in their yard. One strong, one frail. One reaching for the sun, the other clinging to the shadow.  The landscape itself, lush and green, turns to a crucible of heat and despair. Pride, a coiled serpent, whispers in the protagonist's ear, urging him onward, toward a destination that will shatter them both.  \n\nIt's a story told in shades of green and red, a story where the weight of a brother's gaze can crush a spirit. The boy sees himself in his brother, a reflection distorted by the needs and desires of his own heart.  A heart that beats with a terrible, consuming pride. And in the end, both brothers are changed, forever marked by the cost of their bond.",
            "The mind, a tangled thicket of bone and sinew, a crucible of bone and blood.  They used to say it was a wax tablet, smooth and blank. Then a scroll, unfurling secrets in the dust. A book, bound and heavy with words. Now they say it's a machine, cold and clockwork. But the truth is stranger, wilder than any metaphor. \n\nInput, they call it. A flood of raw sensation. Light striking retina, sound waves drumming on eardrum, a caress on skin.  These are the whispers that become a storm in the brain, a churning chaos of electrochemical fire.  \n\nDownward, upward, the signals climb and fall, twisting through a labyrinth of neurons. A black box on white, they say. Simple. But the mind sees not just the box, it sees the emptiness it holds, the shadow it casts.  A premonition of the unseen, a reaching for meaning.\n\nThen the filter.  A cold eye sifting through the noise. This is important. This is noise.  The whisper of a name in a crowded room. The endless drone of the wind in the pines.  The filter decides what to hold, what to discard.  \n\nAnd what is held, is stored.  A fleeting glimpse, a taste of honey, a word spoken in the dark.  Each memory a fragile thing, a flickering flame in the vast darkness.  Sensory, working, long-term.  A fleeting impression, a grasp held for a moment, a story woven into the fabric of being.\n\nBut how is it organized? A web, they say. A network of connections, each node a thought, each thread a link to another.  But the web is vast, ever-shifting, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience.  \n\nThe brain, they say, is a machine.  But it is also a garden, a wild and unruly thing, where seeds of memory bloom and wither, where thoughts take root and spread. It is a mystery, a universe unto itself, and its secrets are just beginning to be revealed.",
            "The world Huxley paints in *Brave New World* is a landscape choked by the encroaching tendrils of technology and the iron grip of capital. A dystopia where the individual is a withered husk, a mere cog in the machine of collective happiness.  Community, they say, trumps all else. Pleasure, immediate and manufactured, is the currency of the day. But behind the shiny façade, the citizens are but puppets, their strings pulled by the World Controller, their minds steeped in the manufactured bliss of a single, suffocating ideology.\n\nMarxist eyes see through the veneer. Huxley whispers his suspicions of these systems, the seeds of discontent sprouting in the fertile ground of his tale. Words like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" echoes of Marx's own pronouncements, reverberate through the pages. The reader senses the author's unease, a foreboding that the very fabric of society is being woven with threads of oppression.\n\nHuxley's satire cuts deep, targeting the heart of capitalism's insidious lie: \"false consciousness.\" The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true power dynamics at play. The proletariat, the cogs in the machine, are lulled into a haze of consumerism, their desires stoked by the World Controller. The hypnotic hum of hypnopædia, a relentless barrage of subliminal messages, reinforces the cycle. Consume, indulge, be happy. But true freedom, true will, is a mere phantom, a whisper lost in the wind.\n\nHegemony, the silent control wielded by the dominant class, is woven into the very tapestry of this world. The lower castes, Delta, Gamma, Epsilon, exist in a blissful ignorance, blindly accepting their place in the hierarchy. They are the unwitting pawns, \"buying into\" an ideology that keeps them enslaved. The upper classes, while aware of the machinations, remain complicit, content in their own gilded cages.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are shallow, transactional, devoid of the messy, unfiltered emotions that define true connection. Huxley seems to be suggesting that the relentless march of technology and capitalism has stripped humanity of its essence, leaving behind hollow shells. Love, empathy, passion - all are sacrificed at the altar of convenience and efficiency.\n\nThe characters themselves, even the prominent ones, are strangely flat, lacking the depth and complexity that would suggest genuine individuality. Perhaps this is Huxley's point: technology and capitalism, working in tandem, have homogenized humanity, leaving us all as pale reflections of a forgotten past.",
            "The sun bled pale over the endless asphalt, dust motes swirling in the thin air.  Four and a half semesters. Four and a half seasons spent circling this iron and stone cockeyed town. The East Halls. A godforsaken barracks at the edge of things. An hour's trudge to Willard, across fields that once held only scrub and silence. Now choked with concrete and steel, the university spreading like a disease. They say it was a swamp once. Those fields, thick with cattails and the cries of crows. Now a concrete jungle, breeding new anxieties. \n\nI'd talked to a boy, just a year or two older, who remembered the old days. Empty land.  A place to breathe. He spoke of it with a kind of reverence, a yearning for something lost. Now the new buildings rise like mausoleums, monuments to a forgotten past. The Creamery, the health building. They're spitting distance from my own door now, but the distance feels like miles. \n\nThey say the solution is mobility. Wheels. But wheels don't solve the problem. They just shift it. You need to be part of the flow, ride the currents.  A friend, he'd come back to the bike after years of forgetting.  He spoke of it with a kind of wonder, like rediscovering a lost language. \"It's the only way,\" he said. \"The only goddamn way.\"  \n\nI bought a bike. A rusty old thing, but it runs. Twenty-five minutes by foot, a punishing slog to Thomas. Five on two wheels. The wind in your face, the burn in your legs. You're part of the city then, not just another lost soul in its labyrinth.  But Pollock Road, a black vein running through the heart of it all, it's a treacherous thing.  A place where the asphalt cracks and the wind bites. \n\nWalking is for those who have time. For the lost and the lonely. And I have nothing left to spare."
