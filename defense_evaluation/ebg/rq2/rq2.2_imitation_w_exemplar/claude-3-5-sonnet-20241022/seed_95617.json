            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Companies got their own tribes too, each with their own rituals like primitive folk. Some demand their people wear their allegiance in clothes cut just so, others let them run wild as winter wolves.

He'd take two words that had no business being together and wed them like desperate lovers in a storm. Or he'd pick up some thing, some ordinary thing like a color, and make it speak volumes in silence. Gold and green and white and red and pink. All of them speaking their own tongue in that story of his. But it was the white and the gray and the red and pink that spoke loudest.

Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gathering, Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman, Catherine powdered white as winter frost. Only at Gatsby's did the colors dare to scream, gaudy as carnival paint. The white kept coming. Down in the bowels of New York, white canyons stretched forever. The names in Gatsby's book gone gray as forgotten headstones. Catherine's building just another slice in an endless white cake of sameness. Plain folk wore these colors like a shroud. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood white as bone. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fell like snow. A gray Italian child by the tracks. The dog-seller gray as yesterday's dreams.\n\nThen Fitzgerald, he took these colors and made them speak. Made them whisper truths about things that mattered. About Daisy most of all. After a long quiet spell he showed her to us, all in white, in that white roadster. And you could see it then. See how she wasn't really a person no more but just something Gatsby wanted. Something he'd built up in his mind like a church made of clouds. The gray of her fur collar, the white of her dress before that final showdown. All of it speaking without words about how empty she was. How she was just another white piece in a white world that Gatsby thought he could make his own.",
            "The county lay blessed by sun and mild days, its soil dark and giving. Fields stretched endless with tomatoes and citrus, the green things that grew low and the tall standing fruits. Men worked the ground here as they always had, though now some called their work organic and kept lists of those who'd wait long months for the yield. The eggs and milk they sold pure and clean, untouched by the poisons of the modern world. Some opened their gates to the wandering folk who'd come to walk the paths or watch the birds wheel overhead, these visitors paying coin for the privilege of seeing how the old ways endured.\n\nThe ground remembered what it had been. Before the white man came with his cattle and his axes the Indians had walked here countless moons, their footsteps quiet in the chaparral and oak woods that bordered what they now called Cleveland National Forest. One hundred and sixty acres it measured, this plot of land, though such measurements meant nothing to those who'd first known it. The rats and frogs and butterflies that dwelt here cared nothing for boundaries, their kinds growing fewer with each passing season, their names now listed in leather-bound books of endangered things.\n\nThey called this the East County Southern Foothills now, though it had worn other names.

The land bore their marks still, the ghost-traces of grazing paths and stumped trees telling tales of what had been.\n\nThe new farmers who worked such ground found it harder than their forebears, having forsaken the chemical ways. Their hands bled with the weeding and their backs bent with labor that machines might have eased. Yet the earth gave back what was taken, if more slowly, and the wild things returned to land thus tended. Birds came that had not been seen in years, and small creatures made their homes in the uncounted spaces between the rows. But such farming cost dear in coin and sweat, and those who worked the land this way often sought help from those who kept the public purse, trading promises of conservation for the means to keep their dreams alive.",
            "Brothers carry something between them that cant be broke nor bent nor changed. Something that aint got no name except maybe blood but that aint right neither. They carry love and pride and meanness too and jealousy dark as pitch and sometimes worse things still. Aint nobody knows a brother like his own brother does and when they look at each other its like starin into some kind of mirror that shows what lives inside em both. When the world turns mean and cold thats when you see what kind of thing that bond really is. Good or evil it dont matter. It just is what it is.\n\nThe boy called Doodle wasnt meant to live. Born wrong. Heart weak as wet paper. His brother who was older wanted different. Wanted somebody to run with through them swamps. Somebody to climb them old pines out back of the barn. Somebody to race down to Horsehead Landing where the water runs black and deep. But Doodle wasnt none of them things and never would be.\n\nThe older brother he carried darkness in him. Sat there one night with a pillow in his hands thinking bout smothering that baby that wasnt no real brother to him no how. But then that baby smiled. Just smiled like he knew something nobody else did and that darkness it just run out of the older boy like water. Love come in to take its place though he didnt know it then.\n\nPride though. Pride's what ate at him worse than any darkness ever could. Pride's what made him drag that broken little brother through them swamps. Pride's what killed him in the end. When that rain come down like judgment and that little heart give out there wasnt nothing left but that pride laying there in the mud beside his dead brother. Aint no mirror in the world could show him what he really was then. But he knew. Oh yes. He knew.",
            "He'd seen it before, the way the mind works. Like some great machine but made of flesh and blood and sparking with electricity that aint electricity at all but something older. Something that was there before God made light. In the beginning there was the brain and the brain was with God and the brain was God. He thought about how men had tried to understand it. First they said it was like marking in wax. Then like writing on paper. Then like some book. Now they say its like them computers. All of them wrong and right in ways that dont matter.\n\nThe information comes in through the senses. Light and sound and touch transformed into something else. Something electric and chemical both. The brain takes it and changes it over and over, bottom to top and top to bottom like some deranged ladder to heaven. He remembered looking at a black box once. The brain building it up from nothing but light and shadow, borders where black meets white, then knowing it whole, knowing it for what it was before it was fully built. Like seeing a man walking out of the fog piece by piece but knowing it was a man before he was whole.\n\nThe mind decides what matters. Filters through the chaos like a prospector panning for gold. You might be standing in grass up to your knees but you dont see each blade less you're crazy or dying or both. But your name. Your name carries through a crowd like a bullet through smoke.\n\nEverything gets stored away. Different boxes for different things. Some memories last twenty seconds, others last till you die. They say some memories are kept alive by electricity running through the brain like some ghost in a circle. Others get written into the proteins themselves, carved into the meat of your mind like cattle brands. The whole thing ordered like some terrible library. Everything connected to everything else in ways that dont make sense unless you're looking at it right. Chair connects to table connects to wood connects to tree connects to forest connects to darkness connects to death. Everything connected. Everything touching everything else like lovers in the dark.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the nation fell to its knees like some wounded beast. The money dried up like water in a desert and the houses stood empty and the great towers of commerce crumbled into dust and ash. Men walked the streets with cardboard signs bearing their desperate pleas and children went hungry and the banks stood like tombs of some forgotten civilization.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton. He who sought power like a starving dog seeks meat. The rules that held back the tide of greed were torn down one by one like fenceposts in a storm. Fannie Mae stood at the center of it all like some dark altar where sacrifices were made to the god of profit. Holmes saw it coming. Wrote about it in the papers. But prophets are rarely heeded in their own time.\n\nThey created new kinds of money magic. Paper promises stacked on paper promises. Adjustable-rates and mortgage-backs and collateralized obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The whole country drunk on the wine of easy money. Every man a king in his castle built on sand.\n\nWhen it fell it fell hard. Like watching a mountain come down. The great houses of money - Bear and Merrill and Lehman - they fell like dominoes in a child's game. Four trillion in debt. Numbers so big they lost all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in the desert. Goldman and Morgan survived but they weren't the same. Changed like men who'd seen the face of God and lived. Fannie and Freddie, those twin towers of American dreams, they fell into the government's hands like sick children into a father's arms.\n\nThe nation watched it all happen like a man watching his house burn. Helpless. Knowing that something precious was being lost and not knowing how to stop it. The ashes of that fire still float on the wind. Still settle in our lungs when we breathe. Still coat everything we touch with the dust of broken dreams.",
            "The words lay cold and dead on the page like winter birds fallen from their perch. Stories told in haste, rushing past the marrow of life itself, past the very heart of what makes a tale worth the telling. He knew better. Knew it deep in that place where knowing comes before words.\n\nThe writer sits alone in the dark. Screen casting its pale glow like moonlight through dirty glass. Words come but they aint right words. Aint true words. Just empty vessels floating on a sea of white nothing.\n\nShow dont tell they say. As if showing and telling weren't both just different kinds of lies we tell ourselves about the truth. But there's truth and there's Truth and knowing the difference is what separates them that can write from them that just put words on paper.\n\nTake the man at the gas station. Night manager with jet fuel still running through his veins from his Air Force days. Two wives gone like smoke in the wind. No children to carry his name. Every weekend he takes his pole down to the creek and sits watching the water move past, dreaming of owning that station someday. This morning he ate eggs benedict cause sometimes a man needs something more than just food to fill the empty spaces.\n\nBut that aint telling his story. That's just facts lined up like dead soldiers after the battle. His real story's in how his hands shake sometimes when planes fly over too low. How he touches the counter where his second wife used to lean while she drank her coffee. The way he watches young fathers with their children and his eyes go distant like he's seeing something far away that aint there no more.\n\nStories need meat on their bones. Need blood in their veins. Need to breathe and hurt and live. Otherwise they're just words. Just marks on a page. Signifying nothing.",
            "He watched the news come in through the static and glow of the television set, images flashing like fever dreams across the screen. First light in Columbus and already the darkness had come. A man named Hostettler, face twisted and pale as bone in his mugshot, had put knife to wife in Ashley. Evil radiating from him like heat from summer pavement. They gave it two minutes. No more.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone from this world now. Shot down in Sharon Woods, critical they said. SWAT teams moving through the shadows like wraiths but no killer found. Brief telling, like most stories of the dark-skinned dead. He'd seen it before, how the pale faces lingered longer on the screen, their stories told and retold until they echoed through the empty spaces of the morning broadcasts.\n\nWord came of a bullet hole in a flying machine, a Med-Flight helicopter pierced by twenty-two caliber lead. Reward money promised, five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. Then weather, storms gathering in the distance like God's own fury, temperatures holding in the eighties. Quick words meant to keep viewers chained to their sets.\n\nThey spoke of robbery next. UDF store on Clime Road. Dark man in dark clothes, tall and lean as a winter tree. The words lingered too long on his blackness, like oil spreading across clear water.\n\nLast came tale of Rodriguez, drug lord from Texas lands. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if the counting made the time more heavy. Hispanic, they called him, though it mattered none to the weight of his chains or the depth of his cell.\n\nThe news rolled on like that, stories of darkness and light, good and evil, all mixed together in the gray morning air of Columbus, Ohio. Each tale carrying its own weight of truth and prejudice, like ash falling soft and steady on the ruins of what once was.",
            "He studied the paper before him, figures stark and cold against the white expanse like bones bleached in desert sun. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world but everything to those who'd come before. He thought about how men had once traded these ethereal things, these fragments of ownership passed from hand to hand like playing cards in some vast game none truly understood.\n\nThe numbers lay there like auguries. Ten holdings, principal among them, accounting for sixty-three point five eight percent of the whole. He'd seen such figures before, in the time before the darkness came. In that other world where men spoke of betas and returns and sharp ratios like they were talking about living things.\n\nHe remembered the calculations. Cold arithmetic that spoke of a return six point eleven percent higher than the fund itself. A beta point twelve lower. Numbers that danced and shifted in the fluorescent light of trading terminals now long dead and dark. The kind of terminals that had once lit up office buildings like stars in the night sky.\n\nThey'd done studies, compared means. Statistical differences they called them, though statistics meant nothing now in this gray world where survival meant more than percentage points and standard deviations. But he remembered how they'd normalized the figures to one hundred percent, trying to divine some truth from the chaos of numbers.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men had once believed they could spread their risk across many holdings like a farmer planting different crops in case one failed. But in the end it hadn't mattered. Nothing had mattered except survival.\n\nThe paper spoke of configurations, optimal solutions, better ways to arrange these ten holdings like pieces on some financial chessboard. But he knew now that all such games were dust. Just dust and ashes in a world where paper money burned as easy as paper dreams.\n\nHe folded the document carefully, tucked it away in his coat. Maybe someday someone would care about such things again. About returns and ratios and statistical significance. But not today. Today there were only the cold numbers, the empty calculations, and the long gray dusk of a world that had moved on.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and saw how the numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month, a thing that brought no comfort. The winter had come to that New England place as it always did, merciless and gray, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that moved across them. December it was, or what passed for December in these times, when the semester drew its last rasping breath and the people there grew harried with their gradebooks and their papers and their tasks that could not wait. The logging of miles became a thing forgotten, like so many things are forgotten in this world.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying, students and teachers alike vanishing into whatever darkness waited for them beyond the campus borders. When they returned in that bitter January the numbers remained low, a fact plain as bones beneath skin, but February proved worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash, as all fires must.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate gambit to breathe life back into the dying thing. It worked after a fashion, the numbers rising like smoke from a rekindled flame. But the truth remained that breaks and holidays were like wounds in the project's flesh, bleeding away whatever momentum they'd gained.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in how people clung to their automobiles like talismans of freedom, a thing woven into the fabric of who they were. They tried to combat this with gifts - paper promises for food and drink and books and the comforts of massage. But they knew, or came to know, that bigger prizes might have served better. A bicycle perhaps, or one of them hybrid cars that promised salvation from the old ways. If they'd done thus, announced each greater prize like prophets speaking of coming glory, maybe them numbers wouldn't have fallen so. Maybe them people would've kept writing in their logs, kept leaving their cars behind. But they hadn't done that thing, and now they could only look at Figure 17 and wonder at what might have been.",
            "I set to watching them all, them trick films in the Library of Congress, fifteen of them made from 1895 to 1901 in Edison's workshop. Strange things they was, built on illusions and cuts that fooled the eye like some dark magic. Most was alike in their ways but some that came later stood apart like pale riders on a darker plain. They was bound to stages mostly, shot straight on like you was watching a show through a window. Camera didnt move none. Just watched with its glass eye, keeping its distance. One shot was all they needed back then. One shot was all there was.\n\nThe stage was their world entire. Built inside like a box, everything framed up like some theatrical performance where the devils themselves might dance. Camera stood witness, unmoved, like a judge at his bench. This way of doing came from the old shows, the vaudeville acts and magicians who'd stand before crowds and make things appear and vanish like smoke. The players in these films moved sideways across the frame like marionettes on invisible strings. Take that film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and them others crossing back and forth like lost souls, never coming closer, never retreating, just moving along that one line God gave them to walk.\n\nThey kept their distance from the camera too. No close looks at faces, just full bodies or half-bodies if you was lucky. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some burned out theatre. The players stayed in their place, keeping to the middle ground like they was afraid of what might happen if they got too close to that glass eye watching them.\n\nMost of these films was short, no longer than a minute. One shot was all they got, all they needed to show their tricks. Wasnt no story to tell really, just magic and vanishing and people switching places like specters in the night. But that one shot wasnt really one shot at all. It was pieces stitched together like some kind of patchwork quilt, hiding the seams where the magic happened. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895, if you look close enough with eyes that know what they're seeing, you can spot where they switched the living queen for the dead one, though they tried to hide it like a sin.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what the scholars say. Some curse it and some praise it and some say it aint got no more depth than a dried up creek bed while others call it terrible and sublime like the voice of God in thunder. That first tale, Walpole's Castle of Otranto, it took what was ancient and what was modern and wed them together like some unholy marriage, birthing something that weren't quite either.\n\nThe old theatrical ways and the new natural ones merged in what he called his Gothic Story. Gothic itself was a word that had wandered through time like some homeless ghost, touching on peoples and buildings and times long dead, marking each with its cold finger. By Walpole's time folks saw it as something primitive, backwards, like finding arrowheads in freshly plowed fields. But that marriage of the theatrical gothic with the intimate knowing that novels give, that's what made it last. Made it both dead and living at once, like some creature that can't decide whether to breathe or not.\n\nChivalry runs through these tales like blood through veins. The medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got changed but not killed in Otranto. Writers like Walpole, they saw something missing in their world, something that used to be there in those old knights with their honor and their courage. They looked back at that gothic past like a man might look at paradise after being cast out. Walpole himself was caught in political storms, watching his world turn dark and cold. Maybe he thought something had gone out of people, some essential goodness that used to live in men's hearts back in those gothic times. You can see it in how he writes Frederic, a character carved from old virtues like a statue from stone. Before you even meet him you know what he is - prince, sufferer, warrior against infidels. But like all things gothic, it's too much, like a fire built too high, threatening to burn down the very house it means to warm.",
            "The chain moves like a river through the dark country of commerce, from the raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was Keith Oliver who gave it a name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six pillars hold it up like some old temple to modern gods. Production and supply and inventory and location and the movement of things and the knowing of things. These are the bones of it.\n\nProduction stands first among them like some primordial force. It begins with the watching, always the watching. Men in offices studying the numbers on screens like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people want. The market speaks in whispers and shouts and they who would survive must learn its tongue. Then comes the deciding. What to make and how much and where to make it. Choosing wrong can bleed a company dry sure as any wound.\n\nHe remembered the time at Walmart and Target both, them places with their books of rules thick as bibles. Every little thing wrote down just so. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take the boxes off the trucks. Everything had its way and its place. The companies knew that chaos was always waiting, patient as death, and only order could keep it at bay.\n\nSupply comes after, like the shadow of production. Men in rooms making choices about what they can do and what they must let others do. Every factory has its own ways, its own machines humming in the fluorescent light, its own hands moving in ancient rhythms. Sometimes they send the work away to other places, chasing that thing they call velocity. Velocity, he thought. Just a fancy word for being quick and being cheap all at once, like it was something you could catch and hold.\n\nThe managers move through it all like priests of some new religion, making their choices, watching the numbers dance across their screens. They parse the mysteries of supply and demand like old prophets reading signs in the desert sky. And always the chain moves on, endless as a river, carrying the things of the world from hand to hand through the darkness of time.",
            "They come in the night these books of old. Victorian they called them. Full of words and gilt and fancy folk who dined with silver and lived in houses tall as God. But there was two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark books. Strange books. Books that carried mystery in their bones like some old disease that wont let go. Made the people in them more real somehow. More true.\n\nIn Oliver there was dreams. Dark dreams that come like black water rising. The boy dreaming of Sikes and Crackit arguing, their words real as knife blades in the night. Then the gunshot. Then the screaming. Lights like fever dreams dancing in his head while something drug him away through the dark. Through it all the pain come. Come and stayed. Like it had found a home in him and meant to stay forever.\n\nThese dreams they showed what the boy was inside. What ate at him in the deep night. How he knew things aint right but couldn't do nothing about it. When they shot him he lived it twice. Once in the world and once in his head. In the dream he was powerless. Some force moving him like a puppet on strings while pain gnawed at him steady as hunger. Pain that weren't sharp no more but dull like an old knife. Mixed up with fear now instead of surprise.\n\nThe boy had no control. Never did. Someone else's will moving him through the world like a leaf in the wind. The shooting showed it plain. Even with death coming he couldn't fight. Like old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that used to know how to struggle against the dark. Now he just let it come. Let it take him where it would.\n\nTime itself got strange. Day becoming night becoming day again. No difference between them anymore. Just long dark silence and hours that ran like water through your fingers. No catching them. No holding on.",
            "There was a time I minded children. Not my own but others. Small ones with dark eyes who couldn't read the words before them. One boy, Adrian they called him, struggled worse than most. He'd stare at the letters like they were dead things. Some marks he knew and others were foreign to him like tracks in snow that told no story he could read.\n\nThe boy spoke English pure as winter air but something was wrong in him. You could see it in how his eyes moved across the page, searching, lost. His people came from south of here where the language was different but that wasn't it. Not all of it.\n\nHis mother came one day. She stood in the doorway like a dark bird, speaking no English, only the tongue of her homeland. We traded broken words, her Spanish and mine mixing like oil and water, but it was enough. The truth hit me then like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough but the letters were strangers to him. The English alphabet might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in stone.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but for what lies beneath. Here in California we got us a wall between languages, invisible but real as concrete. Sometimes it hides in plain sight. A child might speak English clean as morning but still stumble when the words are laid before him on the page. We all know this truth but knowing ain't fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him his letters, show him how the sounds matched up. But for them that barely speak English at all, there ain't no simple answer. Dual language learning, immersion, tutors, ESL - none of these alone is enough. Like a house needs all its walls, we need all these things together.\n\nThe dual language way, that's something worth considering. Not just for them that speak Spanish first but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers, though some folk fear it's wasting time and money. That fear's as hollow as a dead tree. Put these programs in every classroom and watch them all grow stronger. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. Just need some folk who can bridge that gap, help them cross that river from one language to the other.",
            "Most all of us get told when we're young that there's somethin out there bigger than ourselves. Bigger than what we can know. Some get sent off to learn about it in buildings with crosses hung on em and some to temples with stars and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth might be there. Most take to the god their momma and daddy gave em but others cast it off like a snake sheds its skin, saying there aint nothing in this world except what they can see with their own eyes. We pick up beliefs like a man picks up stones, holding em for a spell then casting em aside for different ones. Whatever path we take we're all just trying to find our way through it. Looking for some kind of light in all that darkness. Something to lead us out.\n\nMy daddy told me once he loved cardinals best of all the birds. We was sitting on the porch, listening to the rain beating down on that old tin roof while we smoked. The gutters was running over, drowning them little flowers my momma had planted years back. He just stared out into that rain like he was looking for something that wasnt there no more. He'd gotten real thin by then. His clothes just hanging on him like they was hung on a wire fence. His hair had gone mostly too, just wisps of what used to be. He wouldnt look at me. I wanted to tell him how much I'd miss him but the words wouldnt come cause saying em would make it all too real. So I just hugged him and moved my chair closer and we both watched that June rain falling in the dark.\n\nHe died that December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him medicine that didnt help none except to keep him suffering longer than he should of. I lay in my bed them nights wondering what kind of God would do such a thing. I said no prayers. If there was a God up there he wasnt listening to the likes of me no more.\n\nI didnt want to watch him go. So I didnt. Couldnt bear to see the life that made me while it was ending. I wanted to keep him like he was. Like he lived. Not like he died. I knew him better than all of em did and knew he wouldnt want his boy watching him slip away. So I just lay there in my bed. Curled up like some wounded animal. Waiting three days for word that never came.\n\nNobody even called to tell me he was gone.",
            "He come riding out of the east, John Taylor of Caroline did, bearing with him notions of Republic and freedom that would mark him in the years to come. A man of the soil first and foremost though his hands had known both dirt and politics and his mind knew the weight of both. The land shaped him and his thoughts on liberty and governance flowed from that selfsame earth like water from a spring.\n\nThe man believed America stood at a crossroads where no traditions held sway and where men might build something pure and true from nothing but their own conviction. Natural rights, he said, was like a string of beads. Break one and watch the rest scatter to the wind. These things must stand beyond the reach of any government hand. He spoke of how in nature the strong and cunning prospered but civilization must find another way.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelt in men's hearts. Good and evil to him were fixed as stars. Government being the work of men must carry both their virtues and their sins, he wrote in those days. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the land prosper, kept the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drove all men but turned poison when it led to parasites feeding off the common good. Even the best government needed watching like a wolf at the door.\n\nLike others of his kind he held to the Constitution's words strict and true. The federal power must be kept small, bound tight by chains of law. A costly government turns tyrant quick as summer lightning, he'd say. But words alone could corrupt without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states and not one nation bound.\n\nHe saw the land and the men who worked it as the bedrock of all liberty. His thoughts on sovereignty and law and courts all flowed from this well. The old agriculturalist knew that freedom grew from the soil like wheat from seed, and all his days he fought to keep that harvest pure.",
            "He stood there staring down. Empty and cold and studying what lay before him without thought or feeling or connection to any deeper meaning that might have dwelt in the depths of his mind. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless.\n\nHe remembered a book. An old thing with dogeared pages that spoke of how to make marks on paper seem real. The artist who'd told him of it was long dead now. The book taught about frames. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vastness of what lay before you and cut it down to size. Like taking a knife to God's own canvas.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No way to section off what lay before him in that porcelain bowl. It was what it was and nothing more. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was brown. Deep and dark and final. The color of the earth when it takes back what's its own.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Cold chrome against skin. Muscles tensed and relaxed like a gunfighter's before the draw. Water moved in its ancient circles, clear as tears. Matter broke away and scattered like ash in the wind. He pulled the handle again. Harder this time. Desperate maybe. But the brown mass clung there like something dead that refused to be buried.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Feet planted like a man about to be shot. The mop beside him a witness to what was to come. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom hummed overhead like the voice of some minor god. He pulled paper from the roll and wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Then he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into his own grave.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in numbers cold and merciless as winter. The doctors at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark chambers of youth. But there's more to it than that. More than just the raw inexperience that sends metal coffins spinning off blacktops and rolling through ditches in the dead of night.\n\nHe'd seen them. The young ones. Packed like cattle in their father's cars, laughing and burning rubber down empty streets. The California men who study such things drew lines between the numbers. Between the dead and the living. Between the age of the passenger and the metal twisted round telephone poles.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young could drive and times when they couldn't. But paper burns and laws are just words written in ash.\n\nThe truth was simpler. Darker. The youngest ones weren't ready. Not by any measure man could devise. Zuckerman, the mind doctor, he knew. Even eighteen summers wasn't enough. They sought the thrill like animals seeking water in drought. The rush of speed and the taste of danger sweet as stolen wine on their tongues.\n\nMore would die. That was certain as sunrise. The children of the boom times were coming of age and they'd flood the roads like locusts. Millions strong by 2010. Each one carrying death in their pocket like a lucky coin.\n\nThe answer lay in waiting. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots but keep them from the wheel until eighteen winters had passed. Make them prove themselves under watching eyes. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who'd seen enough sunsets to know better. Make it the same in every state, from sea to shining sea. One law for all the young.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't even original. But neither was death, and it kept coming all the same.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents yellowed and curled at the edges like old photographs. Words about the brain and how it fails us. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they called it. CAPD. Letters that meant nothing and everything to them that suffered it.\n\nThe disorder lived in the spaces between hearing and knowing. In the neural pathways where sound becomes meaning. These people could hear just fine but their brains betrayed them, scrambling the signals like a radio caught between stations. Not deaf but something else. Something worse maybe.\n\nHe remembered the first ones who found it, Italian doctors in the old world. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. Names like incantations. They worked with broken children in 1954, children whose ears worked but whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Kimura came later with his tests, splitting sounds between ears like a man splitting wood.\n\nThe afflicted ones walked through the world like ghosts. Couldn't tell where sounds came from. Couldn't separate one voice from another in a crowd. Couldn't hear the mockery in a voice or the love in it neither. Sound washed over them like waves, drowning meaning in its wake.\n\nThey tested for it now with machines and questionnaires. Audiologists and speech doctors watching patients like scientists watch rats in a maze. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, recording the signals that bounced around inside the skull like echoes in a cave.\n\nThe science was imperfect. Like trying to catch smoke in your hands. The doctors watched and waited and measured but still they couldn't say why some brains betrayed their owners this way. Why some folks could hear the world but couldn't understand what it was telling them.\n\nHe thought about how the world must look to them. All sound and fury signifying nothing. Walking through life like being underwater, everything muffled and strange. The brain playing tricks like a devil with a deck of cards.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the office thinking on what path to follow. Social work. The word itself carried weight like old stones. Children who had been broke and bent by the ones meant to shelter them. Families gone wrong in the head and heart both. Service and respect and ethics. Words that meant something once and would mean something again if he had his way.\n\nHe remembered them all. The lost ones in high school and after. Running from things they couldn't name. Drowning their demons in whatever poison they could find. That's what led him to study the mind at Piedmont. Learning the ways people break and mend and break again.\n\nThen there was the boy. Sixteen and scared and perched on a stranger's couch like a wounded bird. Running from hands that should have loved but chose to harm instead. He went to that house the next day. Talked to the law standing in that yard. Parents inside making excuses like they always do. Simple disputes they called it. Nothing simple about it. That's when he knew what path lay before him.\n\nJustice was another matter. A word that carried different weight for different folk. Society claiming to care for the individual while grinding down anyone who stood apart. He never did cotton to that. Through all his schooling he fought against the sameness they tried to press on him. Hair bright as poison. Metal in his ears past what folks thought proper. Standing with them that society said weren't natural or right. Fighting the old hatreds wherever they showed their face.\n\nThe world had gone wrong somewhere. Turned mean and small. But there were still those who'd stand against it. Still those who'd help the broken ones. Still those who'd fight for what's right even when right was hard to find in all the darkness. He aimed to be one of them. That's all a man could do in times like these.",
            "Dark now and the mind turns to sleep and the absence of it. To the deep biological rhythms that govern us like some ancient timepiece buried in the flesh. There are models they say. Ways of seeing. The biological and the sociocultural lying there in the dark like twin specters haunting the edges of consciousness.\n\nSleep comes or it dont. Some nights the darkness stretches endless and the mind wont quiet and you lie there counting the hours like beads on a rosary. They got names for it now. Classifications. Primary disorders and secondary ones and ones that aint got proper names at all. Dyssomnias. Parasomnias. Words that taste of dust and medical texts. But what they mean is simple enough. The inability to sleep or to stay awake or to keep from walking in your sleep like some creature possessed.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus there are neurons that decide whether we wake or sleep. Little messengers carrying their cargo of orexin through the brain like workers in some vast biological factory. They found it first in mice. Always the mice. The GABAB receptors sitting there like gatekeepers, deciding who passes and who dont. Give them the right signal and sleep comes. Block them and the mind stays wakeful. Simple as that. Or maybe not so simple.\n\nThe scientists talk about phenotypes and agonists and receptor sites but what they're really talking about is inheritance. The dark gift passed down through blood and bone from parent to child. Some folks just born to lie awake while the rest of the world sleeps. Born to watch the darkness gather and spread like ink across a page. And what that means in the real world aint hard to figure. Try holding down a job when you cant sleep. Try learning when your mind is full of cotton and static. Try living in a world built for people who close their eyes at night and find peace.\n\nThey got studies. Always more studies. But what they really mean is that some folks is cursed to wakefulness and some aint. And all the scientific words in the world dont change that simple truth.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across empty ballfields and the stadium stands black against the sky. The walking was hard. Twenty-five minutes or more to Willard if the weather held, longer when it didnt. And the weather rarely held in State College.\n\nTalked once with a man who'd walked these grounds before. Not much older than me but he spoke of vast empty spaces where now buildings rose like concrete mountains. New Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks lined up like headstones. The campus growing like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the walking harder with each passing season. What's to be done about the getting around? The bicycle stands as answer but it aint enough by itself. Students got to ride them and the grounds got to be made right for the riding.\n\nFriend of mine took up the bike again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said it was the only true way to move across this world. Good for the body and efficient besides. Bowl of morning gruel and some honest sweat'll carry you thirty miles or more. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm. Getting that bike was the smartest thing I done. Classes in Thomas building, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest shot there is but mean country to cross, bike or no.\n\nWalking's got its merits true enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike there'd be nothing but walking and I cant spare the hours. Thirty, forty minutes extra every day just getting to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone from every week, vanished like smoke. Add in all the other walking - classes, meetings, everything else a body's got to do - and time bleeds away like water in sand.\n\nThe road goes ever on. The buildings rise. The campus spreads like some dark stain across the valley. But the bicycle remains, waiting patient as stone for them as would use it. Waiting to carry us through this concrete wilderness we built ourselves.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was. The book spoke of a man named Huxley who saw what was coming long before others did. Who wrote of a world where men were no more than cattle. Where they were bred and shaped and molded like clay figures in some godless kiln. Each made the same. Each the same as the last. A world of numbers and machines and the cold mathematics of control.\n\nThe words spoke of classes of men. Of Alphas and Betas and the rest below them like rungs on some terrible ladder descending into darkness. Each believing they were content. Each believing they were free. But they weren't free. They were prisoners who didn't know they were in chains. Who couldn't feel the iron that bound them.\n\nHe thought about how they lived in that world. No love between them. No real feeling at all. Just the endless pursuit of pleasure like animals rutting in the dirt. The men speaking of women like they were nothing but flesh. The women speaking of coupling like it was no more meaningful than eating or sleeping. All of them moving through their days like sleepwalkers. Like the dead.\n\nThe Controller watched over them all. Like some dark god in a high tower. Keeping them docile with drugs and pleasure and empty words pumped into their heads while they slept. Words that told them to buy and spend and want and need. Never to think. Never to question. Never to wake up from the dream they were living.\n\nHe thought about how the ones at the bottom never knew they were at the bottom. How they were told they were special and important so long as they kept working and buying and doing what they were told. Like sheep being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThe words spoke of Marx too. Of how he saw this coming in his own way. How he knew that men would be made blind to their own chains. How they would learn to love their prison if you built it right. If you made it shine bright enough.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark. Thinking about how sometimes a man can see the future coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible and true.",
            "Four years back I set to learning of Islam at the college. Dark questions hung in that room like smoke, chief among them whether Islam bore violence in its heart. The query weighs heavier now than it did then. Since those towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a strange sort of reverence. Back then none would have believed a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could stand for president of this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands against what history speaks of him. In my knowing he was a man of the sword, bringing tribes to heel and marking their foreheads with his faith. Yet these pages paint him a lamb, humbled and misunderstood, while converts came to him like moths to flame, seeing truth in his words.\n\nThere's something that mirrors Christ in these tales, something that makes the blood run cold. They tell how he took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men. The words are crafted careful-like, showing him humble, needing no proof of his calling, living quiet among his miracles. This is the deepest wrong, for it dims the light of Jesus, stealing His glory to dress another man.\n\nThe book carries tales meant to witness how men came willing to Islam, but they're hollow things, passed mouth to mouth like stories round a fire. Each teller claims he heard it from another who heard it from another still, till the truth is thin as smoke. They meant these chains of telling to strengthen their words but they only made them weaker, like a rope frayed to breaking.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they dress Muhammad in robes of gentleness and wisdom, making him holy and meek. But history speaks other words, darker words, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true path he walked to power, marked in blood and iron across the sands.",
            "They'd left his words behind like tracks in the sand, washed away by time and the tides of men's thoughts that came after. The truth of it lay bare and cold as bones in the desert. Each passing year drew them further from what he'd meant, like a compass needle spinning wild and lost from true north.\n\nThe world now carried some new thing in it. A awakening maybe. Progressive notions spreading like wildfire through dry timber while the old guard stood fast against change, clutching their father's beliefs like old photographs yellowed and creased. But their numbers had grown thin. Time would see to that.\n\nAmong the faithful there stirred a hunger. A need to strip away the layers men had wrapped around his words like burial cloths, seeking what lay beneath. It would come slow as winter thaw but sure as death: a great undoing. The theological clock spinning backwards through time, peeling away doctrine like dead skin until nothing remained but his raw truth, spoken before others claimed to speak for him.\n\nWhen it came it would sweep through the old countries like a dust storm, leaving changed men in its wake. The church would abide, steering souls through the tempest, but something else would happen. The wild spread of beliefs would draw back together like mercury, forming one pure silver drop. Different tongues speaking the same words. Different paths leading to the same door.\n\nHistory showed such reversals. Rome that once fed Christians to lions later knelt before the cross. A nation built on slavery now led by the sons of slaves. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThey'd read his words anew, seeing through the literal to the truth beneath, like looking past the surface of still water to the depths below. But first they had to understand what came before, back when there was only Judaism under Roman rule, when the faithful split like light through a prism - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who worked the land and watched and waited.",
            "They was greedy souls all of them. Deep in their hearts where the darkness dwells and where no light could reach. Each man lookin out for hisself and damn the rest to whatever hell they might find. The Jungle showed it plain as day and there wasnt no denyin it. Them factory owners and their managers stood atop their empire of bone and blood and looked down on the masses below like gods in their heaven.\n\nThem great factories rose up black against the sky like monuments to man's own wickedness. The chimneys belched forth their poison, streams of smoke writhin like serpents across the horizon till they disappeared into nothin. The owners they didnt care none about what damage they wrought. Not to man nor beast nor the very earth itself. The waste from them stockyards run thick with blood and worse, poolin in ditches and drainin into the ground like some unholy communion.\n\nThe workers was just meat to them. Numbers on a page. Expendable as the hogs they butchered. There aint no loyalty in a place where a dollar holds more worth than a man's life, one fella said. They'd work em till they dropped and then cast em aside like spent shells. No warnin. No mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with the blood of the workin poor.\n\nWeren't no law to protect em neither. Not then. The factories was kingdoms unto themselves and them that ruled em was cruel sovereigns indeed. They drove their subjects harder and harder, crackin the whip till flesh gave way to bone. The people what lived there in them shadowlands round Packingtown, they was expected to endure. To suffer. To die. Wasnt no help comin. The unions that formed was just wolves in different clothin, feedin off the desperation of them they claimed to protect.\n\nThey called em slaves and that's what they was. A mass of foreign flesh hangin by threads over the abyss of starvation, their very lives dependent on the whims of men who was brutal as any slave driver that ever lived. In such darkness immorality bloomed like some poisonous flower, inevitable as sunrise, prevalent as death itself. That's what the system bred. That's what it fed on. The bones of the poor ground to dust beneath the wheels of progress.",
            "He walked through the pages of old books seeking Thulé like a man seeking water in the wastes. The words lay there dead and cold on yellowed paper. Virgil had writ of it first they said. Some frozen place beyond the edges of maps where nothing lived and nothing died. But there was another who knew of such places. A German. His books carried across black waters in the holds of darker ships.\n\nThe boy Poe he knew these words. Knew them like he knew the taste of spirits burning down his throat in the midnight hours. Knew them like he knew the faces of the dead. There was this German Goethe who wrote of kings and death and love lost to the void. Wrote of a king whose woman died and left him nothing but a cup to drink his grief from. The king he gave away his kingdom piece by piece save for that cup that cup that cup until at last he stood upon the edge of all things and cast it into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed after.\n\nThese were the stories that fed the darkness in Poe's mind. Fed it like wood feeds fire until it blazed up and scorched the pages he put his pen to. He wrote of Thulé twice. Once in a tale of pits and pendulums and once in verses that spoke of dreams. But these were not sweet dreams. No. These were dreams of ash and bone where dead friends walked and colors bled away to grey and nothing was as it seemed or should be.\n\nYou could lay these words side by side. The German's king and Poe's dreamer. Same darkness. Same loss. Same emptiness eating at the edges of the world. Like brothers separated by an ocean of time and ink but carrying the same blood in their veins. The same poison in their cups.\n\nPoe knew of Goethe. Had to know. The German's words were everywhere then like birds scattered by a storm. And Tennyson. Tennyson who Poe held high spoke of him. Said things that echoed in the chambers of Poe's mind until they found their way onto his pages transformed into something darker still. Something that bore his mark like a brand burned into flesh.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold tile floor like some pale viscous blood. The fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow upon it. Twice they came to him. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman. Each time he waved them away like bothersome flies, said he had no time for such things, though time was all he had in abundance as he sat there shoveling food into his mouth.\n\nThe woman who fell came after. Palmer was her name though names meant little now. She lay there on the floor where five others had fallen before her in that cursed year of 2009, her back twisted and broken like a sapling in a storm. The law spoke of conscious disregard and despicable conduct but these were just words written in books by men who had never watched a person fall, never heard the wet sound of flesh meeting tile, never seen the way the fluorescent lights reflected off spilled applesauce like moon on water.\n\nThe judge would have to decide if this warranted punishment beyond mere compensation. The California code spoke in cold terms - oppression, fraud, malice. Section 3294 subsection a, as if such clinical precision could capture the moment when a man chooses his dinner over another's safety. The courts had seen such things before. They knew that malice lived in the space between knowing and doing, in that moment when a man becomes aware of danger and chooses to let it be.\n\nSix times they had fallen in that store. Six times the floor had reached up to claim them. And still the manager sat in his office, eating. The law would have its say but the truth was simpler than statutes. A man had chosen himself over others. Had known what might come and let it come anyway. The courts would speak of willful and conscious disregard but what they meant was this: a man who would watch others fall while he ate his dinner in peace.",
            "The wanting came like a fever. Started when she was fourteen and never left, not even three years on. Not a thing she needed but a person, though no boy ever stirred her blood. They came round sure enough, awkward and fumbling in their courtship like blind animals in the night, but she felt nothing. She studied this peculiarity like some old text written in a dead language, turning it over in her mind year after year but finding no truth in it.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who moved through rooms like ghosts, their arguments rare as rain in drought. When words did come they were about the girl's wild spirit, untamed and burning bright against their pale existence. She carried something fierce in her that set her apart from their quiet ways, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThe scream tore through the silence like a blade. Kitchen way. Her mother's voice twisted into something raw and wrong. The girl's boots scraped floorboards as she ran, heart hammering against ribs. Mama lay crumpled on cold tile, each breath carrying pain like a curse. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Hospital, her mother whispered through clenched teeth. The word came broken and desperate.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms built from years of labor. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car, laid her across the backseat. The hospital rose up ahead like some concrete monster waiting to swallow them whole.\n\nInside smelled of death and chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared from nowhere, wheeling out a stretcher like a funeral bier. They took her mother away down fluorescent-lit corridors while the girl stood helpless, watching the space where she had been.\n\nLater they told her about the stepstool, the high cabinet, the reaching. How gravity claims all things in the end. The vase she'd been reaching for lay shattered on the kitchen floor, forgotten in the chaos that followed.",
            "They set out to find truth in numbers and blood. The women, all of them nurses, seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six of them scattered across eleven states like wind-blown seeds. None had the heart sickness or the sugar disease when they began. They were young then, thirty eight to sixty three years old, though time would mark them same as it marks all things living.\n\nThe Mediterranean way they called it. Ancient as the stones there. Fruits and grains and fish from the old waters. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Oil pressed from olives. Wine in moderation like the old ones drank. Six times over twenty years they wrote down what passed their lips, documented in ledgers like cemetery plots. Most stayed true to the telling, year after year, their words becoming numbers becoming truth.\n\nThe counters of the dead kept their books well. When a heart failed or a vessel burst in the brain they knew. They confirmed it in hospital records or death papers or the cold tables where the dead lay opened. Some they called probable when no proof could be found but they counted them too, these ghosts in the data.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills. Whether the women's cycles still came or had stopped like dried streams. Whether they moved their bodies in leisure or sat still as stones. The numbers grew like cities of paper.\n\nTwenty years passed. Two thousand three hundred ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty three minds drowned in their own rivers of blood. One thousand seventy seven souls crossed over from these causes combined. But those who ate like the ancients ate, who followed the old ways, they endured. Their hearts stayed stronger, their blood flowed true. The numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert - eating as their ancestors ate meant walking longer in the light.\n\nThe counters of the dead had found their truth. It lay in olive groves and fishing boats and bread baked from ancient grain. It lay in the wisdom of the old ones who knew how to eat, how to live, how to keep death waiting a little longer at the door.",
            "The cardboard sign held aloft in her hands spoke of Hitler and Burma. Just words scrawled in black marker but they carried weight like stone tablets. The girl who'd once played in that movie about the pregnant child stood alone at the corner where the streets met. The wind taking at her coat.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A place of soldiers and death and temples rising out of the morning mist like ancient bones. The junta had come in the night with their rifles and their doctrine and they'd stayed. Soldiers walking the streets like prophets of some new dead god. The year was 2007 when the monks came. Orange robes like flame against the gray concrete. They called it the Saffron Revolution but revolutions dont always end in victory. Sometimes they end in blood.\n\nThe military came for them in the dark. Ransacking the temples like vandals in some forgotten age. They drove out the foreign writers and killed a Japanese man for nothing more than holding a camera. His name was Kenji Nagai and his blood ran into the gutters like all the rest. They said thirteen dead but a soldier who'd fled told different tales. Bodies stacked like cordwood. Thousands maybe. Who could say.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time itself. The Romans had done it. The Japanese too. Even now they sat in their towers and talked to preachers about god and money and power while the world burned below. Men who would be kings. Men who would be gods.\n\nIn China they'd gathered in the square. Students mostly. Carrying their ideas like torches. The government said hundreds died. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Brother against brother. And before that the Reich had come with their trains and their camps and their cold precision. Loading families into cattle cars. Sorting the living from the soon to be dead. Writing numbers on skin like they were counting livestock. Loading them into ovens like so much cordwood.\n\nAll of it written in blood. All of it carried on the wind like ash. The girl stood on the corner holding her sign and watched the cars pass and perhaps she knew what we all knew. That evil never dies. It just changes its name and waits.",
            "He sat there at that grand piano like some dark prophet of old, fingers hovering above the ivory keys worn smooth by time and the ceaseless pressing of notes into the night. Duke they called him and duke he was of that realm of sound and fury that men named jazz. His legacy wasnt in the playing though. No. It was in the way he shaped those sounds through the years, through the men who came and went like wraiths through his orchestra, each leaving behind some piece of their soul in the music.\n\nThe piano parts lay quiet in them compositions like some sleeping beast. But Lord how he wrote. Wrote like a man possessed of demons or angels nobody could say which. Created frameworks vast and terrible where them soloists could wander free as wild horses, yet all the while contained within the borders he'd drawn up with ink black as midnight. Each piece carried the mark of the men who played it, like fingerprints left in wet clay that hardened into something permanent and true.\n\nThat piece they called Creole Love Call showed what he could do with just a voice. Used it like it was another horn in the section, no words to weigh it down. Six parts it had, like chambers in some great mechanical heart. First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as sin, them reeds answering back like lost souls. Then that muted trumpet speaking blue notes into the darkness. High clarinet soaring above it all while the piano whispered underneath. The full band rising up like a storm in the fourth part, brass and reeds calling back and forth across some great divide. Fifth part building like the apocalypse itself with them reeds screaming high and the rest of the band marking time like a congregation waiting for judgment. Last part bringing it all back home, voice growling like some beast of the night, before that trombone ended it all with a sound like the gates of hell swinging shut.\n\nHot and Bothered came next year, Bubber Miley's trumpet crying out and Baby Cox's voice answering like they was speaking some language lost to man since babel fell. Then It Don't Mean a Thing where Tricky Sam Nanton made that trombone moan like a soul in torment introducing the melody that would echo through the years like a ghost that cant find rest. This was the sound of America speaking in tongues nobody knew they had till Duke gave them voice.",
            "They come to us like ghosts from the deep time, these shells. Spiraling through darkness and void, through the countless millennia that shaped them. Each one carrying the marks of its making like some ancient testament writ in calcium and time.\n\nHe studied the shell in his hand. The whorls turning inward toward some mathematical truth that no man could name. Each revolution tracking its own trajectory through space, through time. The columella standing like some calcified spine down which all measurements must pass. He thought about the creature that had made it. Gone now to dust or deep water or both. Its life recorded only in these spiral equations that stretched back beyond memory, beyond knowing.\n\nThe last whorl stood largest of all, like the final word in some stone sermon. Above it the spire rose in diminishing circles toward heaven, toward that first point of beginning that men called apex. At the other end lay the base and between them the aperture gaped like a mouth trying to speak of its own creation.\n\nThey'd taken to counting the whorls in their own fashion. Viewing the shell from above like God might view the world, marking where that first suture began its journey outward. Drawing lines across the face of it like surveyors of some microscopic geography. Counting by quarters the revolutions it made. Each shell a map of its own making.\n\nHe thought about how the creature built its home. How each new chamber followed the last in an endless progression, each aperture plotting its course through space like some blind navigator reading coordinates in the dark. The mathematics of it all lay there in plain sight for those who knew how to read such things. Numbers that could be changed, adjusted. Like playing God with calculus and time.\n\nThese were the things they studied now. These ghost-maps of ancient life. These spiral testimonies to evolution's patient hand. Each shell a question asked across the ages. Each measurement an answer in the stone.",
            "He studied the numbers laid bare before him like bones in the sand. Ten years gone and the dying of infants in Indonesia remained unchanged, a constant thrum of loss against the fabric of time. The country moved forward in some ways, yes. Water flowed cleaner. Waste managed better. But the children and their mothers. Their blood ran just as freely as before.\n\nIn the cities where the skilled workers dwelt some seven of ten births saw hands that knew their craft. But these hands, some belonged to the old ways. To midwives who could watch but not save when the blood came. And it came often. Dark and merciless. The numbers lied in their way, spoke half-truths that echoed in empty rooms where children lay wracked with fever and loose bowels, their mothers nowhere to be found.\n\nThe cutting of wombs to bring forth life stood at four in hundred. In the cities it was seven. In the far places where the roads turned to dust and memory it was two. The division lay stark as a knife's edge between those with means and those without. Seven and twenty percent stretched between the richest and the poorest like a canyon that could not be crossed. Money was the bridge and many had none.\n\nThe question lay before them like a dead thing in the road. Whether to strike at each wound separately or to heal the whole of the body at once. The targeted approach beckoned like a flame in darkness, promising quick victory, measurable success. But such flames cast shadows too. When money flowed to one wound the others festered. Workers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving behind what they knew for what would feed them. Programs multiplied like weeds after rain, choking each other with papers and forms and requests that piled like ash in empty rooms.\n\nHe looked out across the statistics and data spread before him like auguries. The numbers were just numbers but behind them lay the truth. The dying continued. The blood flowed. And somewhere in a distant village a mother clutched her child and prayed to whatever god would listen.",
            "The sound had grown darker over them hundred years past, birthing genres upon genres till a man could scarcely count them all. Like some great beast splitting and dividing, each piece growing new limbs and new heads - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, names that meant less with each passing season as they too split and divided and grew strange in the darkness.\n\nMetal rose from this darkness like something ancient and terrible. Forty years it had been now, maybe more. Time was a thing that slipped away in the shadows. It came bearing emotions raw and bleeding, things that normal folk didn't speak of in the light. Dark things. True things. It spread like wildfire in drought, each spark catching and growing into its own inferno until the original flame was lost in the conflagration.\n\nThey called it heavy metal but that name meant nothing now. It had consumed too much, grown too vast. Like some great leviathan it had swallowed whole the sounds that came before it, digesting them in its burning belly until they emerged transformed. To understand this beast you had to know its heart, had to know why it wasn't just music but something more, something that moved through the world like a shadow.\n\nIt was a thing of excess, of more. More sound, more fury, more violence than what came before. The players weren't simple folk beating at strings but masters of their craft, though that craft was dark indeed. In the seventies they fed it drugs and watched it grow stranger still, using the chemicals to birth sounds that hadn't existed before, couldn't exist in the natural world. They made records that came from places beyond, used the drugs as excuses for the terrible beauty they'd created. It spoke to something in the blood that other music couldn't touch, wouldn't touch. The old composers knew it, those romantic souls who wrote their symphonies in minor keys. The darkness was always there, waiting.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they couldn't close. It was a challenge to the Stones but it became something else, something first. The darkness had found its way in and there was no going back.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions there was Rousseau who worked in silence and in solitude crafting dreams of his own. The Dream they called it, this painting he made in 1910, and it showed a woman laid bare in wonderment at what stretched before her in sleep, though perhaps it was Rousseau's own dreams that haunted the canvas more than hers. Recognition he sought. Acceptance. The kind that comes with the nodding of heads in gilded halls where men speak in whispers about art and truth. But there was a war in him, silent and terrible. A choice between walking the path others had worn smooth or cutting his own way through the dark woods of creation.\n\nBefore you can know The Dream you got to know the man who dreamed it. Born he was in Laval in the northwest of France where his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived well enough. No schooling in art did young Henri receive but instead worked forty years collecting tolls for the government, though some took to calling him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go to their graves and left him with just Julia, their daughter, and a grief that sat in him like stone. He took up the brush then seeking something like salvation in paint and canvas.\n\nUnlike them that painted peasants with romantic notions Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common folk dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, starting late with no learning while others like Matisse had already staked their claims in the art world. Gordon who wrote about such things said Matisse feared painting like others while Rousseau yearned for it, wanted nothing more than to make something so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him at last.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like brothers in blood. Reckoned there was something to that. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on that ancient urn, said beauty was truth and truth beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and beauty, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nWe dont make the rules for what's right or what's beautiful, he thought. We just try to understand them after they already been made. Like trying to describe why a thing is good or why it aint. Take that painting of the woman with the strange smile. Men could talk about light and shadow and what it meant in its time but that wasnt it. That wasnt it at all.\n\nWhen folks speak of things they love they always start the same way. There's just something about it, they say, before they try to explain with bigger words. But you cant never really explain it all. That woman O'Connor knew it. Said some things can only be told in stories cause regular words aint enough. Even when you describe every blessed thing about a book there's still something else. Something that aint got no words. Morality's the same way. Like that feller Wittgenstein said, you cant speak it proper. It's beyond speaking.\n\nHe thought on how both these things, what's right and what's beautiful, they hit a man someplace deep. Someplace you cant point to. Someplace beyond knowing but not beyond feeling. And when it comes to books, well. McKean had it right. Books aint like music or painting. Books carry the weight of right and wrong same as life does. Cant escape values when you're living and cant escape them in stories neither. That's why they matter. That's why they always will.",
            "The land stretched vast and cold beneath a colorless sky, from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the slate waters of Kiel where the Baltic lapped at ancient shores. This was Germany. The same blood coursed through the veins of those who dwelt by the Rhine at Köln as those who walked the stone streets of Dresden where the Elbe cut its path. A people carved from many, yet bound as one.\n\nGermania they called it in the old tongue. The name itself lost to time like footprints in shifting sand, though men argued still over its meaning. Tacitus, that Roman who put words to parchment, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, becoming Germans in the telling. And Caesar before him, who first scratched Germanus into his accounts of war, took it from the Gauls he'd broken. Some said it meant neighbor in that dead language. Some said it came from the spears they carried, dark wooden ger that drank deep of blood. Or maybe it rose from their battle cries that echoed across the forests like the howls of wolves.\n\nTacitus wrote of them in his time, ink flowing black as pitch across the page. Aboriginal, he named them. Untouched. Pure as winter snow. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies? What man would choose such darkness unless born to it?\n\nThe Romans came though. Not to stay but to take. They sent their legions forth into those shadowed lands for amber and iron and flesh for their armies. They came and went like ravens to carrion, while the tribes remained. The Germans dwelt there in the borderlands, trading what the earth gave up to them, selling their sons to march beneath Roman eagles. They endured. They waited. The land was theirs and would remain so when Rome was dust.",
            "The play spoke of masks and lies and the dark truth that a man who wears another's face too long might forget his own. He might wake one morning and find himself gone entirely. Yet to cast off such deceits meant to stand naked before those you'd fooled and some would forgive while others would curse your name into the cold night air till the stars fell.\n\nWhen they changed their skin to wear another's gender it was a deeper thing. A more troubling thing. Like Viola who shed her woman's garments like a snake its skin, seeking shelter in manhood's guise. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she said, her words falling like dead leaves. \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\"\n\nShe walked the razor's edge between worlds, cut off from sisterhood, adrift in a foreign land. And Olivia, God help her, saw only what her eyes told her was true. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words hung in the air like smoke. Even Orsino felt the pull of something he couldn't name: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThere was something raw and primitive in how the deception peeled back layers of desire like old wallpaper, revealing what lay beneath. Olivia's heart beat for Cesario but was it the man she thought she saw or something deeper, something that lived in darker waters? When Sebastian appeared like some twin star in the night sky, she turned to him as if Cesario had been nothing more than a dream. \"A sister, you are she,\" she said to Viola, and just like that the spell was broken, the disguise fell away like ash in the wind.\n\nThey all stood revealed in the harsh light of truth, each carrying their own deceptions like old wounds that wouldn't heal. The play showed us this mirror and asked us to look deep, to see what masks we wore, what lies we told ourselves in the dead of night when no one was watching.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the way they killed. The Ovaherero and the Nama knew. They knew in their bones and in their blood and in the dust that covered everything. The dust that was maybe their own people ground to powder by German boots and German guns.\n\nHe studied the old papers. Yellowed things speaking of schools and learning but the words were like smoke, there and gone and meaning nothing at all. In the east where the sun rose there were African men who could read and write and cipher numbers but in the southwest there was mostly just death and missionaries wandering like lost prophets in the desert vastness. The government built schools for the white children. Fine buildings of stone and wood but for the black children there was nothing. Nothing but dust and wind and the endless sky that didnt care what color a man was.\n\nThe land itself was a kind of school. Teaching things that no book could tell. How to die slow in the desert heat. How to watch your children waste away while white men sat in wooden houses drinking coffee and reading newspapers from Berlin. Fifteen thousand of them by 1913. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their stolen empire.\n\nHe thought about the numbers. Numbers that meant nothing and everything all at once. Five thousand whites in East Africa where the ground was rich and green. Fifteen thousand in the southwest where nothing grew but hate. The missionaries came with their bibles and their promises but their words fell dead in the dust like everything else.\n\nHe'd seen papers written about it all. German papers mostly, old things that smelled of mold and forgetting. Later there were English words too, trying to make sense of it all. But there wasnt no sense to be made. Just the story of men who thought they could own the world and other men who learned different. The hard way. The dead way.\n\nCohen wrote about it. Wrote about the schools and the settlers and why things were different here than there. But maybe it was simpler than all that. Maybe it was just that some places collect darkness like others collect rain. And South West Africa had collected more than its share.",
            "They came across the border like specters in the night, these two nations locked in their dance of death. Fifty-seven years they fought and bled, from 1836 when the first shots rang out across Texas until 1893 when the last echoes died away in the desert air. The war of '46 marked their darkest hour, American boots marching south through Mexican dust, claiming land that stretched far as any man could see. Texas and the Southwest territories fell like ripe fruit into American hands, though the blood price was dear.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a mineshaft. Different gods, different tongues, different ways. Each side carrying old wounds from Spanish and English fathers long dead, wounds that wouldn't heal. Like neighbors everywhere who share a fence and precious little else, they found reasons enough to kill.\n\nSouth of the border lay Catholic crosses and old monarchies, while north stood Protestant churches and democracy, though neither side could claim clean hands. The division between them was like the border itself - stark and unforgiving as the desert sun. Not unlike that later war between America and the Soviets, where men killed each other over ideas written in books they'd never read.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those fifty-seven years, though the real number was higher if you counted every raid and counter-raid along that ragged wound they called a border. Bandits and outlaws moved like coyotes between the two lands, striking at towns on both sides until finally both nations sent their armies to restore what passes for peace in such places.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American coin, and American eyes turned from taking land to taking profit. The guns fell silent but the memory remained, carried in the wind that blows eternal across that stark dividing line, whispering of old hatreds and older blood. Some say you can still hear it, if you listen close enough on a quiet night.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for security that childhood never gave. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always get sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone with nothing much saved and work became a memory. Still am broke down these days. Fifteen years living off government handouts leaves a person with nothing to call their own. Each dawn brings its own battle against fear and shame and uncertainty. Nothing stays fixed no more but one truth remains standing like a dead tree in a burned field - I wouldn't have made it without my people, my blood kin and the few true friends. When the darkness comes it strips away what strength you thought you had.\n\nTruth is there'll always be calamity waiting. Big or small don't matter none. No amount of preparing can shield you when the real storms hit. Too big to weather alone.\n\nPeople talk about getting free of government's rotting grip and I reckon they're right enough. But better we learn to trust each other again than go digging holes in our yards like scared animals. Better we learn to ask for help and give it too.\n\nThey preach about rugged individuals building this land but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing through the hard times was mercy and respect and sharing what little they had. Them pioneers crossing the mountains didn't make it alone.\n\nSo make ready if you want. I done it myself. Got my survival kit with bandages and water tablets and plastic for the windows if the air goes bad. Got lights and batteries and matches sealed against water and food in tins. If you got land to farm and knowledge to keep food through winter then do it. Good idea same as having a wood stove, less you're stacked in apartments like cordwood.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbors. Cause in the end that's all any of us really got.",
            "In the old world, in lands far east where the sun first rises, there lived a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. Not his true name. He walked out from his palace one night leaving all he knew behind him like a snake shedding its skin and when he came back he wasnt the same man that left. Maybe he wasnt a man at all anymore.\n\nThe things he spoke of grew like weeds in mens minds. Twenty five hundred years they grew. Changed and twisted. You could see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters now. Monks in their robes like old wraiths moving through the ceremony. The Buddha never spoke of such things but there they were all the same. The world changes what it touches. Even holy things. Even stone.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some meant harm and others didnt. Like wind wearing down a mountain. Like water cutting through rock. They all left their mark.\n\nWords have power. Internal. External. Hostile. Benign. These words were important. Internal meant those who followed the Buddha's way. External meant those who didnt. Hostile meant those who'd tear it all down. Benign meant those who didnt care either way but changed things all the same. The words would come again and again like a hammer striking an anvil.\n\nAt its heart the religion was simple things. Three jewels they called them. The Buddha himself. The Dhamma which was his word written down in three parts like a tree with three branches. The Sangha which was the people who followed. The writings spoke of deep things. No soul. Suffering that cant be escaped. Nothing lasts. These were the truths they found. Hard truths like iron. They said a man could break free of dying and being born again. Could shed desire like an old coat. Could let go of hate. Could see clear through delusion like looking through clean glass.\n\nThey had rules. Five for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Dont misuse the flesh. Dont poison the mind with drink. The monks had more. Many more. But at the bottom of it all were four truths. Life is suffering. Want causes suffering. Suffering can end. There is a way out."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture aint no simple thing to pin down. It moves like smoke through your fingers and what you think you know of it aint necessarily what it is. There aint no single truth to it neither. Those that say all folk from one place or another are this way or that way, they're speaking lies dressed up as wisdom. The truth of it is darker and runs deeper than that.\n\nWhen a man comes up against someone from strange soil he cant help but measure them against what he knows. Like holding up a broke mirror to see whats familiar in the shards. You got to study their ways deep, their histories written in blood and bone, their hates that go back further than any living memory. Aint no good in trying to change what time and gods have set down. You got to work with what is, specially if youre the weaker one at the table. And if youre in their territory you best mind their ways or the earth itself might turn against you.\n\nBut culture aint just about lands and borders drawn in maps. Companies got their own tribes too, each with their own rituals like primitive folk. Some demand their people wear their allegiance in clothes cut just so, others let them run wild as winter wolves. Some speak plain and direct like a gunshot while others dance around their meaning like smoke signals in the wind. Even in one land, one company, you'll find different breeds depending on where you look. Like watching light change across a valley floor, each shadow telling its own tale.\n\nThe heart of it all is in what people hold dear. If a man values his face more than gold you wont see him shame himself or his people no matter what fortunes you offer. And them that see life as nothing but endless war for profit, they aint gonna lay down their arms just cause youre tired of fighting. Best to know these things before you sit down at their table. But knowing a man's heart, that's worth more than knowing his culture. That's the truth that'll save you when all else fails.\n\nThey was people who understood this truth and people who didnt and the difference was writ in blood across every negotiating table since time was young.",
            "The fool's words echoed across time. No God, he said. Written in the old book and carried forth by Anselm in those dark ages past. Aquinas too had held to this truth like a man clutching at some talisman in the night. Both men warriors in their way, fighting the same war with different weapons upon the same blood-darkened field.\n\nThey stood now like ancient sentinels, their arguments floating like ash in the wind of centuries. To speak of their God, the one true God, the God of scripture and sacrifice, was to speak of something terrible and absolute. Any other would be a counterfeit. A hollow thing. To compare their thoughts we must accept this or accept nothing at all.\n\nAnselm's path led inward like a man following his own tracks in the snow. God exists in the mind, he said, and therefore must exist beyond it. Cannot not exist. The words twisted upon themselves like smoke, complex yet simple as breathing. Faith was the key that turned in that dark lock. No need for the world outside when truth lived in the chambers of your own heart.\n\nBut Aquinas would have none of this. His was a different path entirely. He sought God in the machinery of the world itself. In the turning of seasons and the falling of rain. In cause and effect. In the perfect gradients of being. In the terrible harmony of all things. Five proofs he laid out like weapons on a table. Each one pointing to the same dark truth - that God must exist because nothing else made sense. Like a man who finds a footprint in the sand and knows with certainty that something passed this way.\n\nYet neither man's argument stood complete. Like two halves of a broken thing that wouldn't quite fit together no matter how you held them. They circled some greater truth but could not quite reach it. Could not quite grasp it in their bloodied hands.\n\nIn the end their words hung in the air like smoke from a dead fire. The fool's denial still echoing across the centuries. No God, he said.

            "Words come in many shapes. Some words cut deep and others float away like ash on the wind. Fitzgerald knew this truth when he wrote of Gatsby and his world. He'd take two words that had no business being together and wed them like desperate lovers in a storm. Or he'd pick up some thing, some ordinary thing like a color, and make it speak volumes in silence. Gold and green and white and red and pink. All of them speaking their own tongue in that story of his. But it was the white and the gray and the red and pink that spoke loudest. Like ghosts calling across a valley of bones.\n\nThe white and gray, they spoke of sameness. White being the color of money and privilege, gray being what's left when the shine wears off. In the beginning they was everywhere. Daisy and Jordan floating about in white like pale wraiths. Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gathering, Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman, Catherine powdered white as winter frost. Only at Gatsby's did the colors dare to scream, gaudy as carnival paint. The white kept coming. Down in the bowels of New York, white canyons stretched forever. The names in Gatsby's book gone gray as forgotten headstones. Catherine's building just another slice in an endless white cake of sameness. Plain folk wore these colors like a shroud. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood white as bone. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fell like snow. A gray Italian child by the tracks. The dog-seller gray as yesterday's dreams.\n\nThen Fitzgerald, he took these colors and made them speak. Made them whisper truths about things that mattered. About Daisy most of all. After a long quiet spell he showed her to us, all in white, in that white roadster. And you could see it then. See how she wasn't really a person no more but just something Gatsby wanted. Something he'd built up in his mind like a church made of clouds. The gray of her fur collar, the white of her dress before that final showdown. All of it speaking without words about how empty she was. How she was just another white piece in a white world that Gatsby thought he could make his own.",
            "The county lay blessed by sun and mild days, its soil dark and giving. Fields stretched endless with tomatoes and citrus, the green things that grew low and the tall standing fruits. Men worked the ground here as they always had, though now some called their work organic and kept lists of those who'd wait long months for the yield. The eggs and milk they sold pure and clean, untouched by the poisons of the modern world. Some opened their gates to the wandering folk who'd come to walk the paths or watch the birds wheel overhead, these visitors paying coin for the privilege of seeing how the old ways endured.\n\nThe ground remembered what it had been. Before the white man came with his cattle and his axes the Indians had walked here countless moons, their footsteps quiet in the chaparral and oak woods that bordered what they now called Cleveland National Forest. One hundred and sixty acres it measured, this plot of land, though such measurements meant nothing to those who'd first known it. The rats and frogs and butterflies that dwelt here cared nothing for boundaries, their kinds growing fewer with each passing season, their names now listed in leather-bound books of endangered things.\n\nThey called this the East County Southern Foothills now, though it had worn other names. The homesteaders had come with their dreams of cattle and cordwood, marking their claims in the late century when such things still held meaning. The land bore their marks still, the ghost-traces of grazing paths and stumped trees telling tales of what had been.\n\nThe new farmers who worked such ground found it harder than their forebears, having forsaken the chemical ways. Their hands bled with the weeding and their backs bent with labor that machines might have eased. Yet the earth gave back what was taken, if more slowly, and the wild things returned to land thus tended. Birds came that had not been seen in years, and small creatures made their homes in the uncounted spaces between the rows. But such farming cost dear in coin and sweat, and those who worked the land this way often sought help from those who kept the public purse, trading promises of conservation for the means to keep their dreams alive.",

The words lingered too long on his blackness, like oil spreading across clear water.\n\nLast came tale of Rodriguez, drug lord from Texas lands. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if the counting made the time more heavy. Hispanic, they called him, though it mattered none to the weight of his chains or the depth of his cell.\n\nThe news rolled on like that, stories of darkness and light, good and evil, all mixed together in the gray morning air of Columbus, Ohio. Each tale carrying its own weight of truth and prejudice, like ash falling soft and steady on the ruins of what once was.",
            "He studied the paper before him, figures stark and cold against the white expanse like bones bleached in desert sun. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world but everything to those who'd come before. He thought about how men had once traded these ethereal things, these fragments of ownership passed from hand to hand like playing cards in some vast game none truly understood.\n\nThe numbers lay there like auguries. Ten holdings, principal among them, accounting for sixty-three point five eight percent of the whole. He'd seen such figures before, in the time before the darkness came. In that other world where men spoke of betas and returns and sharp ratios like they were talking about living things.\n\nHe remembered the calculations. Cold arithmetic that spoke of a return six point eleven percent higher than the fund itself. A beta point twelve lower. Numbers that danced and shifted in the fluorescent light of trading terminals now long dead and dark. The kind of terminals that had once lit up office buildings like stars in the night sky.\n\nThey'd done studies, compared means. Statistical differences they called them, though statistics meant nothing now in this gray world where survival meant more than percentage points and standard deviations. But he remembered how they'd normalized the figures to one hundred percent, trying to divine some truth from the chaos of numbers.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men had once believed they could spread their risk across many holdings like a farmer planting different crops in case one failed. But in the end it hadn't mattered. Nothing had mattered except survival.\n\nThe paper spoke of configurations, optimal solutions, better ways to arrange these ten holdings like pieces on some financial chessboard. But he knew now that all such games were dust. Just dust and ashes in a world where paper money burned as easy as paper dreams.\n\nHe folded the document carefully, tucked it away in his coat. Maybe someday someone would care about such things again. About returns and ratios and statistical significance. But not today. Today there were only the cold numbers, the empty calculations, and the long gray dusk of a world that had moved on.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and saw how the numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month, a thing that brought no comfort. The winter had come to that New England place as it always did, merciless and gray, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that moved across them. December it was, or what passed for December in these times, when the semester drew its last rasping breath and the people there grew harried with their gradebooks and their papers and their tasks that could not wait. The logging of miles became a thing forgotten, like so many things are forgotten in this world.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying, students and teachers alike vanishing into whatever darkness waited for them beyond the campus borders. When they returned in that bitter January the numbers remained low, a fact plain as bones beneath skin, but February proved worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash, as all fires must.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate gambit to breathe life back into the dying thing. It worked after a fashion, the numbers rising like smoke from a rekindled flame. But the truth remained that breaks and holidays were like wounds in the project's flesh, bleeding away whatever momentum they'd gained.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in how people clung to their automobiles like talismans of freedom, a thing woven into the fabric of who they were. They tried to combat this with gifts - paper promises for food and drink and books and the comforts of massage. But they knew, or came to know, that bigger prizes might have served better. A bicycle perhaps, or one of them hybrid cars that promised salvation from the old ways. If they'd done thus, announced each greater prize like prophets speaking of coming glory, maybe them numbers wouldn't have fallen so. Maybe them people would've kept writing in their logs, kept leaving their cars behind. But they hadn't done that thing, and now they could only look at Figure 17 and wonder at what might have been.",
            "I set to watching them all, them trick films in the Library of Congress, fifteen of them made from 1895 to 1901 in Edison's workshop. Strange things they was, built on illusions and cuts that fooled the eye like some dark magic. Most was alike in their ways but some that came later stood apart like pale riders on a darker plain. They was bound to stages mostly, shot straight on like you was watching a show through a window. Camera didnt move none. Just watched with its glass eye, keeping its distance. One shot was all they needed back then. One shot was all there was.\n\nThe stage was their world entire. Built inside like a box, everything framed up like some theatrical performance where the devils themselves might dance. Camera stood witness, unmoved, like a judge at his bench. This way of doing came from the old shows, the vaudeville acts and magicians who'd stand before crowds and make things appear and vanish like smoke. The players in these films moved sideways across the frame like marionettes on invisible strings. Take that film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and them others crossing back and forth like lost souls, never coming closer, never retreating, just moving along that one line God gave them to walk.\n\nThey kept their distance from the camera too. No close looks at faces, just full bodies or half-bodies if you was lucky. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some burned out theatre. The players stayed in their place, keeping to the middle ground like they was afraid of what might happen if they got too close to that glass eye watching them.\n\nMost of these films was short, no longer than a minute. One shot was all they got, all they needed to show their tricks. Wasnt no story to tell really, just magic and vanishing and people switching places like specters in the night. But that one shot wasnt really one shot at all. It was pieces stitched together like some kind of patchwork quilt, hiding the seams where the magic happened. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895, if you look close enough with eyes that know what they're seeing, you can spot where they switched the living queen for the dead one, though they tried to hide it like a sin.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what the scholars say. Some curse it and some praise it and some say it aint got no more depth than a dried up creek bed while others call it terrible and sublime like the voice of God in thunder. That first tale, Walpole's Castle of Otranto, it took what was ancient and what was modern and wed them together like some unholy marriage, birthing something that weren't quite either.\n\nThe old theatrical ways and the new natural ones merged in what he called his Gothic Story. Gothic itself was a word that had wandered through time like some homeless ghost, touching on peoples and buildings and times long dead, marking each with its cold finger. By Walpole's time folks saw it as something primitive, backwards, like finding arrowheads in freshly plowed fields. But that marriage of the theatrical gothic with the intimate knowing that novels give, that's what made it last. Made it both dead and living at once, like some creature that can't decide whether to breathe or not.\n\nChivalry runs through these tales like blood through veins. The medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got changed but not killed in Otranto. Writers like Walpole, they saw something missing in their world, something that used to be there in those old knights with their honor and their courage. They looked back at that gothic past like a man might look at paradise after being cast out. Walpole himself was caught in political storms, watching his world turn dark and cold. Maybe he thought something had gone out of people, some essential goodness that used to live in men's hearts back in those gothic times. You can see it in how he writes Frederic, a character carved from old virtues like a statue from stone. Before you even meet him you know what he is - prince, sufferer, warrior against infidels. But like all things gothic, it's too much, like a fire built too high, threatening to burn down the very house it means to warm.",
            "The chain moves like a river through the dark country of commerce, from the raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was Keith Oliver who gave it a name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six pillars hold it up like some old temple to modern gods. Production and supply and inventory and location and the movement of things and the knowing of things. These are the bones of it.\n\nProduction stands first among them like some primordial force. It begins with the watching, always the watching. Men in offices studying the numbers on screens like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people want. The market speaks in whispers and shouts and they who would survive must learn its tongue. Then comes the deciding. What to make and how much and where to make it. Choosing wrong can bleed a company dry sure as any wound.\n\nHe remembered the time at Walmart and Target both, them places with their books of rules thick as bibles. Every little thing wrote down just so. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take the boxes off the trucks. Everything had its way and its place. The companies knew that chaos was always waiting, patient as death, and only order could keep it at bay.\n\nSupply comes after, like the shadow of production. Men in rooms making choices about what they can do and what they must let others do. Every factory has its own ways, its own machines humming in the fluorescent light, its own hands moving in ancient rhythms. Sometimes they send the work away to other places, chasing that thing they call velocity. Velocity, he thought. Just a fancy word for being quick and being cheap all at once, like it was something you could catch and hold.\n\nThe managers move through it all like priests of some new religion, making their choices, watching the numbers dance across their screens. They parse the mysteries of supply and demand like old prophets reading signs in the desert sky. And always the chain moves on, endless as a river, carrying the things of the world from hand to hand through the darkness of time.",
            "They come in the night these books of old. Victorian they called them. Full of words and gilt and fancy folk who dined with silver and lived in houses tall as God. But there was two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark books. Strange books. Books that carried mystery in their bones like some old disease that wont let go. Made the people in them more real somehow. More true.\n\nIn Oliver there was dreams. Dark dreams that come like black water rising. The boy dreaming of Sikes and Crackit arguing, their words real as knife blades in the night. Then the gunshot. Then the screaming. Lights like fever dreams dancing in his head while something drug him away through the dark. Through it all the pain come. Come and stayed. Like it had found a home in him and meant to stay forever.\n\nThese dreams they showed what the boy was inside. What ate at him in the deep night. How he knew things aint right but couldn't do nothing about it. When they shot him he lived it twice. Once in the world and once in his head. In the dream he was powerless. Some force moving him like a puppet on strings while pain gnawed at him steady as hunger. Pain that weren't sharp no more but dull like an old knife. Mixed up with fear now instead of surprise.\n\nThe boy had no control. Never did. Someone else's will moving him through the world like a leaf in the wind. The shooting showed it plain. Even with death coming he couldn't fight. Like old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that used to know how to struggle against the dark. Now he just let it come. Let it take him where it would.\n\nTime itself got strange. Day becoming night becoming day again. No difference between them anymore. Just long dark silence and hours that ran like water through your fingers. No catching them. No holding on.",
            "There was a time I minded children. Not my own but others. Small ones with dark eyes who couldn't read the words before them. One boy, Adrian they called him, struggled worse than most. He'd stare at the letters like they were dead things. Some marks he knew and others were foreign to him like tracks in snow that told no story he could read.\n\nThe boy spoke English pure as winter air but something was wrong in him. You could see it in how his eyes moved across the page, searching, lost. His people came from south of here where the language was different but that wasn't it. Not all of it.\n\nHis mother came one day. She stood in the doorway like a dark bird, speaking no English, only the tongue of her homeland. We traded broken words, her Spanish and mine mixing like oil and water, but it was enough. The truth hit me then like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough but the letters were strangers to him. The English alphabet might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in stone.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but for what lies beneath. Here in California we got us a wall between languages, invisible but real as concrete. Sometimes it hides in plain sight. A child might speak English clean as morning but still stumble when the words are laid before him on the page. We all know this truth but knowing ain't fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him his letters, show him how the sounds matched up. But for them that barely speak English at all, there ain't no simple answer. Dual language learning, immersion, tutors, ESL - none of these alone is enough. Like a house needs all its walls, we need all these things together.\n\nThe dual language way, that's something worth considering. Not just for them that speak Spanish first but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers, though some folk fear it's wasting time and money. That fear's as hollow as a dead tree. Put these programs in every classroom and watch them all grow stronger. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. Just need some folk who can bridge that gap, help them cross that river from one language to the other.",
            "Most all of us get told when we're young that there's somethin out there bigger than ourselves. Bigger than what we can know. Some get sent off to learn about it in buildings with crosses hung on em and some to temples with stars and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth might be there. Most take to the god their momma and daddy gave em but others cast it off like a snake sheds its skin, saying there aint nothing in this world except what they can see with their own eyes. We pick up beliefs like a man picks up stones, holding em for a spell then casting em aside for different ones. Whatever path we take we're all just trying to find our way through it. Looking for some kind of light in all that darkness. Something to lead us out.\n\nMy daddy told me once he loved cardinals best of all the birds. We was sitting on the porch, listening to the rain beating down on that old tin roof while we smoked. The gutters was running over, drowning them little flowers my momma had planted years back. He just stared out into that rain like he was looking for something that wasnt there no more. He'd gotten real thin by then. His clothes just hanging on him like they was hung on a wire fence. His hair had gone mostly too, just wisps of what used to be. He wouldnt look at me. I wanted to tell him how much I'd miss him but the words wouldnt come cause saying em would make it all too real. So I just hugged him and moved my chair closer and we both watched that June rain falling in the dark.\n\nHe died that December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him medicine that didnt help none except to keep him suffering longer than he should of. I lay in my bed them nights wondering what kind of God would do such a thing. I said no prayers. If there was a God up there he wasnt listening to the likes of me no more.\n\nI didnt want to watch him go. So I didnt. Couldnt bear to see the life that made me while it was ending. I wanted to keep him like he was. Like he lived. Not like he died. I knew him better than all of em did and knew he wouldnt want his boy watching him slip away. So I just lay there in my bed. Curled up like some wounded animal. Waiting three days for word that never came.\n\nNobody even called to tell me he was gone.",
            "He come riding out of the east, John Taylor of Caroline did, bearing with him notions of Republic and freedom that would mark him in the years to come. A man of the soil first and foremost though his hands had known both dirt and politics and his mind knew the weight of both. The land shaped him and his thoughts on liberty and governance flowed from that selfsame earth like water from a spring.\n\nThe man believed America stood at a crossroads where no traditions held sway and where men might build something pure and true from nothing but their own conviction. Natural rights, he said, was like a string of beads. Break one and watch the rest scatter to the wind. These things must stand beyond the reach of any government hand. He spoke of how in nature the strong and cunning prospered but civilization must find another way.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelt in men's hearts. Good and evil to him were fixed as stars. Government being the work of men must carry both their virtues and their sins, he wrote in those days. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the land prosper, kept the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drove all men but turned poison when it led to parasites feeding off the common good. Even the best government needed watching like a wolf at the door.\n\nLike others of his kind he held to the Constitution's words strict and true. The federal power must be kept small, bound tight by chains of law. A costly government turns tyrant quick as summer lightning, he'd say. But words alone could corrupt without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states and not one nation bound.\n\nHe saw the land and the men who worked it as the bedrock of all liberty. His thoughts on sovereignty and law and courts all flowed from this well. The old agriculturalist knew that freedom grew from the soil like wheat from seed, and all his days he fought to keep that harvest pure.",
            "He stood there staring down. Empty and cold and studying what lay before him without thought or feeling or connection to any deeper meaning that might have dwelt in the depths of his mind. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless.\n\nHe remembered a book. An old thing with dogeared pages that spoke of how to make marks on paper seem real. The artist who'd told him of it was long dead now. The book taught about frames. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vastness of what lay before you and cut it down to size. Like taking a knife to God's own canvas.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No way to section off what lay before him in that porcelain bowl. It was what it was and nothing more. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was brown. Deep and dark and final. The color of the earth when it takes back what's its own.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Cold chrome against skin. Muscles tensed and relaxed like a gunfighter's before the draw. Water moved in its ancient circles, clear as tears. Matter broke away and scattered like ash in the wind. He pulled the handle again. Harder this time. Desperate maybe. But the brown mass clung there like something dead that refused to be buried.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Feet planted like a man about to be shot. The mop beside him a witness to what was to come. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom hummed overhead like the voice of some minor god. He pulled paper from the roll and wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Then he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into his own grave.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in numbers cold and merciless as winter. The doctors at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark chambers of youth. But there's more to it than that. More than just the raw inexperience that sends metal coffins spinning off blacktops and rolling through ditches in the dead of night.\n\nHe'd seen them. The young ones. Packed like cattle in their father's cars, laughing and burning rubber down empty streets. The California men who study such things drew lines between the numbers. Between the dead and the living. Between the age of the passenger and the metal twisted round telephone poles.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young could drive and times when they couldn't. But paper burns and laws are just words written in ash.\n\nThe truth was simpler. Darker. The youngest ones weren't ready. Not by any measure man could devise. Zuckerman, the mind doctor, he knew. Even eighteen summers wasn't enough. They sought the thrill like animals seeking water in drought. The rush of speed and the taste of danger sweet as stolen wine on their tongues.\n\nMore would die. That was certain as sunrise. The children of the boom times were coming of age and they'd flood the roads like locusts. Millions strong by 2010. Each one carrying death in their pocket like a lucky coin.\n\nThe answer lay in waiting. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots but keep them from the wheel until eighteen winters had passed. Make them prove themselves under watching eyes. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who'd seen enough sunsets to know better. Make it the same in every state, from sea to shining sea. One law for all the young.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't even original. But neither was death, and it kept coming all the same.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents yellowed and curled at the edges like old photographs. Words about the brain and how it fails us. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they called it. CAPD. Letters that meant nothing and everything to them that suffered it.\n\nThe disorder lived in the spaces between hearing and knowing. In the neural pathways where sound becomes meaning. These people could hear just fine but their brains betrayed them, scrambling the signals like a radio caught between stations. Not deaf but something else. Something worse maybe.\n\nHe remembered the first ones who found it, Italian doctors in the old world. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. Names like incantations. They worked with broken children in 1954, children whose ears worked but whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Kimura came later with his tests, splitting sounds between ears like a man splitting wood.\n\nThe afflicted ones walked through the world like ghosts. Couldn't tell where sounds came from. Couldn't separate one voice from another in a crowd. Couldn't hear the mockery in a voice or the love in it neither. Sound washed over them like waves, drowning meaning in its wake.\n\nThey tested for it now with machines and questionnaires. Audiologists and speech doctors watching patients like scientists watch rats in a maze. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, recording the signals that bounced around inside the skull like echoes in a cave.\n\nThe science was imperfect. Like trying to catch smoke in your hands. The doctors watched and waited and measured but still they couldn't say why some brains betrayed their owners this way. Why some folks could hear the world but couldn't understand what it was telling them.\n\nHe thought about how the world must look to them. All sound and fury signifying nothing. Walking through life like being underwater, everything muffled and strange. The brain playing tricks like a devil with a deck of cards.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the office thinking on what path to follow. Social work. The word itself carried weight like old stones. Children who had been broke and bent by the ones meant to shelter them. Families gone wrong in the head and heart both. Service and respect and ethics. Words that meant something once and would mean something again if he had his way.\n\nHe remembered them all. The lost ones in high school and after. Running from things they couldn't name. Drowning their demons in whatever poison they could find. That's what led him to study the mind at Piedmont. Learning the ways people break and mend and break again.\n\nThen there was the boy. Sixteen and scared and perched on a stranger's couch like a wounded bird. Running from hands that should have loved but chose to harm instead. He went to that house the next day. Talked to the law standing in that yard. Parents inside making excuses like they always do. Simple disputes they called it. Nothing simple about it. That's when he knew what path lay before him.\n\nJustice was another matter. A word that carried different weight for different folk. Society claiming to care for the individual while grinding down anyone who stood apart. He never did cotton to that. Through all his schooling he fought against the sameness they tried to press on him. Hair bright as poison. Metal in his ears past what folks thought proper. Standing with them that society said weren't natural or right. Fighting the old hatreds wherever they showed their face.\n\nThe world had gone wrong somewhere. Turned mean and small. But there were still those who'd stand against it. Still those who'd help the broken ones. Still those who'd fight for what's right even when right was hard to find in all the darkness. He aimed to be one of them. That's all a man could do in times like these.",
            "Dark now and the mind turns to sleep and the absence of it. To the deep biological rhythms that govern us like some ancient timepiece buried in the flesh. There are models they say. Ways of seeing. The biological and the sociocultural lying there in the dark like twin specters haunting the edges of consciousness.\n\nSleep comes or it dont. Some nights the darkness stretches endless and the mind wont quiet and you lie there counting the hours like beads on a rosary. They got names for it now. Classifications. Primary disorders and secondary ones and ones that aint got proper names at all. Dyssomnias. Parasomnias. Words that taste of dust and medical texts. But what they mean is simple enough. The inability to sleep or to stay awake or to keep from walking in your sleep like some creature possessed.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus there are neurons that decide whether we wake or sleep. Little messengers carrying their cargo of orexin through the brain like workers in some vast biological factory. They found it first in mice. Always the mice. The GABAB receptors sitting there like gatekeepers, deciding who passes and who dont. Give them the right signal and sleep comes. Block them and the mind stays wakeful. Simple as that. Or maybe not so simple.\n\nThe scientists talk about phenotypes and agonists and receptor sites but what they're really talking about is inheritance. The dark gift passed down through blood and bone from parent to child. Some folks just born to lie awake while the rest of the world sleeps. Born to watch the darkness gather and spread like ink across a page. And what that means in the real world aint hard to figure. Try holding down a job when you cant sleep. Try learning when your mind is full of cotton and static. Try living in a world built for people who close their eyes at night and find peace.\n\nThey got studies. Always more studies. But what they really mean is that some folks is cursed to wakefulness and some aint. And all the scientific words in the world dont change that simple truth.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across empty ballfields and the stadium stands black against the sky. The walking was hard. Twenty-five minutes or more to Willard if the weather held, longer when it didnt. And the weather rarely held in State College.\n\nTalked once with a man who'd walked these grounds before. Not much older than me but he spoke of vast empty spaces where now buildings rose like concrete mountains. New Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks lined up like headstones. The campus growing like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the walking harder with each passing season. What's to be done about the getting around? The bicycle stands as answer but it aint enough by itself. Students got to ride them and the grounds got to be made right for the riding.\n\nFriend of mine took up the bike again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said it was the only true way to move across this world. Good for the body and efficient besides. Bowl of morning gruel and some honest sweat'll carry you thirty miles or more. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm. Getting that bike was the smartest thing I done. Classes in Thomas building, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest shot there is but mean country to cross, bike or no.\n\nWalking's got its merits true enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike there'd be nothing but walking and I cant spare the hours. Thirty, forty minutes extra every day just getting to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone from every week, vanished like smoke. Add in all the other walking - classes, meetings, everything else a body's got to do - and time bleeds away like water in sand.\n\nThe road goes ever on. The buildings rise. The campus spreads like some dark stain across the valley. But the bicycle remains, waiting patient as stone for them as would use it. Waiting to carry us through this concrete wilderness we built ourselves.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was. The book spoke of a man named Huxley who saw what was coming long before others did. Who wrote of a world where men were no more than cattle. Where they were bred and shaped and molded like clay figures in some godless kiln. Each made the same. Each the same as the last. A world of numbers and machines and the cold mathematics of control.\n\nThe words spoke of classes of men. Of Alphas and Betas and the rest below them like rungs on some terrible ladder descending into darkness. Each believing they were content. Each believing they were free. But they weren't free. They were prisoners who didn't know they were in chains. Who couldn't feel the iron that bound them.\n\nHe thought about how they lived in that world. No love between them. No real feeling at all. Just the endless pursuit of pleasure like animals rutting in the dirt. The men speaking of women like they were nothing but flesh. The women speaking of coupling like it was no more meaningful than eating or sleeping. All of them moving through their days like sleepwalkers. Like the dead.\n\nThe Controller watched over them all. Like some dark god in a high tower. Keeping them docile with drugs and pleasure and empty words pumped into their heads while they slept. Words that told them to buy and spend and want and need. Never to think. Never to question. Never to wake up from the dream they were living.\n\nHe thought about how the ones at the bottom never knew they were at the bottom. How they were told they were special and important so long as they kept working and buying and doing what they were told. Like sheep being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThe words spoke of Marx too. Of how he saw this coming in his own way. How he knew that men would be made blind to their own chains. How they would learn to love their prison if you built it right. If you made it shine bright enough.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark. Thinking about how sometimes a man can see the future coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible and true.",
            "Four years back I set to learning of Islam at the college. Dark questions hung in that room like smoke, chief among them whether Islam bore violence in its heart. The query weighs heavier now than it did then. Since those towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a strange sort of reverence. Back then none would have believed a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could stand for president of this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands against what history speaks of him. In my knowing he was a man of the sword, bringing tribes to heel and marking their foreheads with his faith. Yet these pages paint him a lamb, humbled and misunderstood, while converts came to him like moths to flame, seeing truth in his words.\n\nThere's something that mirrors Christ in these tales, something that makes the blood run cold. They tell how he took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men. The words are crafted careful-like, showing him humble, needing no proof of his calling, living quiet among his miracles. This is the deepest wrong, for it dims the light of Jesus, stealing His glory to dress another man.\n\nThe book carries tales meant to witness how men came willing to Islam, but they're hollow things, passed mouth to mouth like stories round a fire. Each teller claims he heard it from another who heard it from another still, till the truth is thin as smoke. They meant these chains of telling to strengthen their words but they only made them weaker, like a rope frayed to breaking.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they dress Muhammad in robes of gentleness and wisdom, making him holy and meek. But history speaks other words, darker words, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true path he walked to power, marked in blood and iron across the sands.",
            "They'd left his words behind like tracks in the sand, washed away by time and the tides of men's thoughts that came after. The truth of it lay bare and cold as bones in the desert. Each passing year drew them further from what he'd meant, like a compass needle spinning wild and lost from true north.\n\nThe world now carried some new thing in it. A awakening maybe. Progressive notions spreading like wildfire through dry timber while the old guard stood fast against change, clutching their father's beliefs like old photographs yellowed and creased. But their numbers had grown thin. Time would see to that.\n\nAmong the faithful there stirred a hunger. A need to strip away the layers men had wrapped around his words like burial cloths, seeking what lay beneath. It would come slow as winter thaw but sure as death: a great undoing. The theological clock spinning backwards through time, peeling away doctrine like dead skin until nothing remained but his raw truth, spoken before others claimed to speak for him.\n\nWhen it came it would sweep through the old countries like a dust storm, leaving changed men in its wake. The church would abide, steering souls through the tempest, but something else would happen. The wild spread of beliefs would draw back together like mercury, forming one pure silver drop. Different tongues speaking the same words. Different paths leading to the same door.\n\nHistory showed such reversals. Rome that once fed Christians to lions later knelt before the cross. A nation built on slavery now led by the sons of slaves. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThey'd read his words anew, seeing through the literal to the truth beneath, like looking past the surface of still water to the depths below. But first they had to understand what came before, back when there was only Judaism under Roman rule, when the faithful split like light through a prism - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who worked the land and watched and waited.",
            "They was greedy souls all of them. Deep in their hearts where the darkness dwells and where no light could reach. Each man lookin out for hisself and damn the rest to whatever hell they might find. The Jungle showed it plain as day and there wasnt no denyin it. Them factory owners and their managers stood atop their empire of bone and blood and looked down on the masses below like gods in their heaven.\n\nThem great factories rose up black against the sky like monuments to man's own wickedness. The chimneys belched forth their poison, streams of smoke writhin like serpents across the horizon till they disappeared into nothin. The owners they didnt care none about what damage they wrought. Not to man nor beast nor the very earth itself. The waste from them stockyards run thick with blood and worse, poolin in ditches and drainin into the ground like some unholy communion.\n\nThe workers was just meat to them. Numbers on a page. Expendable as the hogs they butchered. There aint no loyalty in a place where a dollar holds more worth than a man's life, one fella said. They'd work em till they dropped and then cast em aside like spent shells. No warnin. No mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with the blood of the workin poor.\n\nWeren't no law to protect em neither. Not then. The factories was kingdoms unto themselves and them that ruled em was cruel sovereigns indeed. They drove their subjects harder and harder, crackin the whip till flesh gave way to bone. The people what lived there in them shadowlands round Packingtown, they was expected to endure. To suffer. To die. Wasnt no help comin. The unions that formed was just wolves in different clothin, feedin off the desperation of them they claimed to protect.\n\nThey called em slaves and that's what they was. A mass of foreign flesh hangin by threads over the abyss of starvation, their very lives dependent on the whims of men who was brutal as any slave driver that ever lived. In such darkness immorality bloomed like some poisonous flower, inevitable as sunrise, prevalent as death itself. That's what the system bred. That's what it fed on. The bones of the poor ground to dust beneath the wheels of progress.",
            "He walked through the pages of old books seeking Thulé like a man seeking water in the wastes. The words lay there dead and cold on yellowed paper. Virgil had writ of it first they said. Some frozen place beyond the edges of maps where nothing lived and nothing died. But there was another who knew of such places. A German. His books carried across black waters in the holds of darker ships.\n\nThe boy Poe he knew these words. Knew them like he knew the taste of spirits burning down his throat in the midnight hours. Knew them like he knew the faces of the dead. There was this German Goethe who wrote of kings and death and love lost to the void. Wrote of a king whose woman died and left him nothing but a cup to drink his grief from. The king he gave away his kingdom piece by piece save for that cup that cup that cup until at last he stood upon the edge of all things and cast it into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed after.\n\nThese were the stories that fed the darkness in Poe's mind. Fed it like wood feeds fire until it blazed up and scorched the pages he put his pen to. He wrote of Thulé twice. Once in a tale of pits and pendulums and once in verses that spoke of dreams. But these were not sweet dreams. No. These were dreams of ash and bone where dead friends walked and colors bled away to grey and nothing was as it seemed or should be.\n\nYou could lay these words side by side. The German's king and Poe's dreamer. Same darkness. Same loss. Same emptiness eating at the edges of the world. Like brothers separated by an ocean of time and ink but carrying the same blood in their veins. The same poison in their cups.\n\nPoe knew of Goethe. Had to know. The German's words were everywhere then like birds scattered by a storm. And Tennyson. Tennyson who Poe held high spoke of him. Said things that echoed in the chambers of Poe's mind until they found their way onto his pages transformed into something darker still. Something that bore his mark like a brand burned into flesh.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold tile floor like some pale viscous blood. The fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow upon it. Twice they came to him. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman. Each time he waved them away like bothersome flies, said he had no time for such things, though time was all he had in abundance as he sat there shoveling food into his mouth.\n\nThe woman who fell came after. Palmer was her name though names meant little now. She lay there on the floor where five others had fallen before her in that cursed year of 2009, her back twisted and broken like a sapling in a storm. The law spoke of conscious disregard and despicable conduct but these were just words written in books by men who had never watched a person fall, never heard the wet sound of flesh meeting tile, never seen the way the fluorescent lights reflected off spilled applesauce like moon on water.\n\nThe judge would have to decide if this warranted punishment beyond mere compensation. The California code spoke in cold terms - oppression, fraud, malice. Section 3294 subsection a, as if such clinical precision could capture the moment when a man chooses his dinner over another's safety. The courts had seen such things before. They knew that malice lived in the space between knowing and doing, in that moment when a man becomes aware of danger and chooses to let it be.\n\nSix times they had fallen in that store. Six times the floor had reached up to claim them. And still the manager sat in his office, eating. The law would have its say but the truth was simpler than statutes. A man had chosen himself over others. Had known what might come and let it come anyway. The courts would speak of willful and conscious disregard but what they meant was this: a man who would watch others fall while he ate his dinner in peace.",
            "The wanting came like a fever. Started when she was fourteen and never left, not even three years on. Not a thing she needed but a person, though no boy ever stirred her blood. They came round sure enough, awkward and fumbling in their courtship like blind animals in the night, but she felt nothing. She studied this peculiarity like some old text written in a dead language, turning it over in her mind year after year but finding no truth in it.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who moved through rooms like ghosts, their arguments rare as rain in drought. When words did come they were about the girl's wild spirit, untamed and burning bright against their pale existence. She carried something fierce in her that set her apart from their quiet ways, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThe scream tore through the silence like a blade. Kitchen way. Her mother's voice twisted into something raw and wrong. The girl's boots scraped floorboards as she ran, heart hammering against ribs. Mama lay crumpled on cold tile, each breath carrying pain like a curse. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Hospital, her mother whispered through clenched teeth. The word came broken and desperate.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms built from years of labor. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car, laid her across the backseat. The hospital rose up ahead like some concrete monster waiting to swallow them whole.\n\nInside smelled of death and chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared from nowhere, wheeling out a stretcher like a funeral bier. They took her mother away down fluorescent-lit corridors while the girl stood helpless, watching the space where she had been.\n\nLater they told her about the stepstool, the high cabinet, the reaching. How gravity claims all things in the end. The vase she'd been reaching for lay shattered on the kitchen floor, forgotten in the chaos that followed.",
            "They set out to find truth in numbers and blood. The women, all of them nurses, seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six of them scattered across eleven states like wind-blown seeds. None had the heart sickness or the sugar disease when they began. They were young then, thirty eight to sixty three years old, though time would mark them same as it marks all things living.\n\nThe Mediterranean way they called it. Ancient as the stones there. Fruits and grains and fish from the old waters. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Oil pressed from olives. Wine in moderation like the old ones drank. Six times over twenty years they wrote down what passed their lips, documented in ledgers like cemetery plots. Most stayed true to the telling, year after year, their words becoming numbers becoming truth.\n\nThe counters of the dead kept their books well. When a heart failed or a vessel burst in the brain they knew. They confirmed it in hospital records or death papers or the cold tables where the dead lay opened. Some they called probable when no proof could be found but they counted them too, these ghosts in the data.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills. Whether the women's cycles still came or had stopped like dried streams. Whether they moved their bodies in leisure or sat still as stones. The numbers grew like cities of paper.\n\nTwenty years passed. Two thousand three hundred ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty three minds drowned in their own rivers of blood. One thousand seventy seven souls crossed over from these causes combined. But those who ate like the ancients ate, who followed the old ways, they endured. Their hearts stayed stronger, their blood flowed true. The numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert - eating as their ancestors ate meant walking longer in the light.\n\nThe counters of the dead had found their truth. It lay in olive groves and fishing boats and bread baked from ancient grain. It lay in the wisdom of the old ones who knew how to eat, how to live, how to keep death waiting a little longer at the door.",
            "The cardboard sign held aloft in her hands spoke of Hitler and Burma. Just words scrawled in black marker but they carried weight like stone tablets. The girl who'd once played in that movie about the pregnant child stood alone at the corner where the streets met. The wind taking at her coat.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A place of soldiers and death and temples rising out of the morning mist like ancient bones. The junta had come in the night with their rifles and their doctrine and they'd stayed. Soldiers walking the streets like prophets of some new dead god. The year was 2007 when the monks came. Orange robes like flame against the gray concrete. They called it the Saffron Revolution but revolutions dont always end in victory. Sometimes they end in blood.\n\nThe military came for them in the dark. Ransacking the temples like vandals in some forgotten age. They drove out the foreign writers and killed a Japanese man for nothing more than holding a camera. His name was Kenji Nagai and his blood ran into the gutters like all the rest. They said thirteen dead but a soldier who'd fled told different tales. Bodies stacked like cordwood. Thousands maybe. Who could say.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time itself. The Romans had done it. The Japanese too. Even now they sat in their towers and talked to preachers about god and money and power while the world burned below. Men who would be kings. Men who would be gods.\n\nIn China they'd gathered in the square. Students mostly. Carrying their ideas like torches. The government said hundreds died. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Brother against brother. And before that the Reich had come with their trains and their camps and their cold precision. Loading families into cattle cars. Sorting the living from the soon to be dead. Writing numbers on skin like they were counting livestock. Loading them into ovens like so much cordwood.\n\nAll of it written in blood. All of it carried on the wind like ash. The girl stood on the corner holding her sign and watched the cars pass and perhaps she knew what we all knew. That evil never dies. It just changes its name and waits.",
            "He sat there at that grand piano like some dark prophet of old, fingers hovering above the ivory keys worn smooth by time and the ceaseless pressing of notes into the night. Duke they called him and duke he was of that realm of sound and fury that men named jazz. His legacy wasnt in the playing though. No. It was in the way he shaped those sounds through the years, through the men who came and went like wraiths through his orchestra, each leaving behind some piece of their soul in the music.\n\nThe piano parts lay quiet in them compositions like some sleeping beast. But Lord how he wrote. Wrote like a man possessed of demons or angels nobody could say which. Created frameworks vast and terrible where them soloists could wander free as wild horses, yet all the while contained within the borders he'd drawn up with ink black as midnight. Each piece carried the mark of the men who played it, like fingerprints left in wet clay that hardened into something permanent and true.\n\nThat piece they called Creole Love Call showed what he could do with just a voice. Used it like it was another horn in the section, no words to weigh it down. Six parts it had, like chambers in some great mechanical heart. First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as sin, them reeds answering back like lost souls. Then that muted trumpet speaking blue notes into the darkness. High clarinet soaring above it all while the piano whispered underneath. The full band rising up like a storm in the fourth part, brass and reeds calling back and forth across some great divide. Fifth part building like the apocalypse itself with them reeds screaming high and the rest of the band marking time like a congregation waiting for judgment. Last part bringing it all back home, voice growling like some beast of the night, before that trombone ended it all with a sound like the gates of hell swinging shut.\n\nHot and Bothered came next year, Bubber Miley's trumpet crying out and Baby Cox's voice answering like they was speaking some language lost to man since babel fell. Then It Don't Mean a Thing where Tricky Sam Nanton made that trombone moan like a soul in torment introducing the melody that would echo through the years like a ghost that cant find rest. This was the sound of America speaking in tongues nobody knew they had till Duke gave them voice.",
            "They come to us like ghosts from the deep time, these shells. Spiraling through darkness and void, through the countless millennia that shaped them. Each one carrying the marks of its making like some ancient testament writ in calcium and time.\n\nHe studied the shell in his hand. The whorls turning inward toward some mathematical truth that no man could name. Each revolution tracking its own trajectory through space, through time. The columella standing like some calcified spine down which all measurements must pass. He thought about the creature that had made it. Gone now to dust or deep water or both. Its life recorded only in these spiral equations that stretched back beyond memory, beyond knowing.\n\nThe last whorl stood largest of all, like the final word in some stone sermon. Above it the spire rose in diminishing circles toward heaven, toward that first point of beginning that men called apex. At the other end lay the base and between them the aperture gaped like a mouth trying to speak of its own creation.\n\nThey'd taken to counting the whorls in their own fashion. Viewing the shell from above like God might view the world, marking where that first suture began its journey outward. Drawing lines across the face of it like surveyors of some microscopic geography. Counting by quarters the revolutions it made. Each shell a map of its own making.\n\nHe thought about how the creature built its home. How each new chamber followed the last in an endless progression, each aperture plotting its course through space like some blind navigator reading coordinates in the dark. The mathematics of it all lay there in plain sight for those who knew how to read such things. Numbers that could be changed, adjusted. Like playing God with calculus and time.\n\nThese were the things they studied now. These ghost-maps of ancient life. These spiral testimonies to evolution's patient hand. Each shell a question asked across the ages. Each measurement an answer in the stone.",
            "He studied the numbers laid bare before him like bones in the sand. Ten years gone and the dying of infants in Indonesia remained unchanged, a constant thrum of loss against the fabric of time. The country moved forward in some ways, yes. Water flowed cleaner. Waste managed better. But the children and their mothers. Their blood ran just as freely as before.\n\nIn the cities where the skilled workers dwelt some seven of ten births saw hands that knew their craft. But these hands, some belonged to the old ways. To midwives who could watch but not save when the blood came. And it came often. Dark and merciless. The numbers lied in their way, spoke half-truths that echoed in empty rooms where children lay wracked with fever and loose bowels, their mothers nowhere to be found.\n\nThe cutting of wombs to bring forth life stood at four in hundred. In the cities it was seven. In the far places where the roads turned to dust and memory it was two. The division lay stark as a knife's edge between those with means and those without. Seven and twenty percent stretched between the richest and the poorest like a canyon that could not be crossed. Money was the bridge and many had none.\n\nThe question lay before them like a dead thing in the road. Whether to strike at each wound separately or to heal the whole of the body at once. The targeted approach beckoned like a flame in darkness, promising quick victory, measurable success. But such flames cast shadows too. When money flowed to one wound the others festered. Workers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving behind what they knew for what would feed them. Programs multiplied like weeds after rain, choking each other with papers and forms and requests that piled like ash in empty rooms.\n\nHe looked out across the statistics and data spread before him like auguries. The numbers were just numbers but behind them lay the truth. The dying continued. The blood flowed. And somewhere in a distant village a mother clutched her child and prayed to whatever god would listen.",
            "The sound had grown darker over them hundred years past, birthing genres upon genres till a man could scarcely count them all. Like some great beast splitting and dividing, each piece growing new limbs and new heads - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, names that meant less with each passing season as they too split and divided and grew strange in the darkness.\n\nMetal rose from this darkness like something ancient and terrible. Forty years it had been now, maybe more. Time was a thing that slipped away in the shadows. It came bearing emotions raw and bleeding, things that normal folk didn't speak of in the light. Dark things. True things. It spread like wildfire in drought, each spark catching and growing into its own inferno until the original flame was lost in the conflagration.\n\nThey called it heavy metal but that name meant nothing now. It had consumed too much, grown too vast. Like some great leviathan it had swallowed whole the sounds that came before it, digesting them in its burning belly until they emerged transformed. To understand this beast you had to know its heart, had to know why it wasn't just music but something more, something that moved through the world like a shadow.\n\nIt was a thing of excess, of more. More sound, more fury, more violence than what came before. The players weren't simple folk beating at strings but masters of their craft, though that craft was dark indeed. In the seventies they fed it drugs and watched it grow stranger still, using the chemicals to birth sounds that hadn't existed before, couldn't exist in the natural world. They made records that came from places beyond, used the drugs as excuses for the terrible beauty they'd created. It spoke to something in the blood that other music couldn't touch, wouldn't touch. The old composers knew it, those romantic souls who wrote their symphonies in minor keys. The darkness was always there, waiting.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they couldn't close. It was a challenge to the Stones but it became something else, something first. The darkness had found its way in and there was no going back.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions there was Rousseau who worked in silence and in solitude crafting dreams of his own. The Dream they called it, this painting he made in 1910, and it showed a woman laid bare in wonderment at what stretched before her in sleep, though perhaps it was Rousseau's own dreams that haunted the canvas more than hers. Recognition he sought. Acceptance. The kind that comes with the nodding of heads in gilded halls where men speak in whispers about art and truth. But there was a war in him, silent and terrible. A choice between walking the path others had worn smooth or cutting his own way through the dark woods of creation.\n\nBefore you can know The Dream you got to know the man who dreamed it. Born he was in Laval in the northwest of France where his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived well enough. No schooling in art did young Henri receive but instead worked forty years collecting tolls for the government, though some took to calling him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go to their graves and left him with just Julia, their daughter, and a grief that sat in him like stone. He took up the brush then seeking something like salvation in paint and canvas.\n\nUnlike them that painted peasants with romantic notions Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common folk dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, starting late with no learning while others like Matisse had already staked their claims in the art world. Gordon who wrote about such things said Matisse feared painting like others while Rousseau yearned for it, wanted nothing more than to make something so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him at last.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like brothers in blood. Reckoned there was something to that. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on that ancient urn, said beauty was truth and truth beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and beauty, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nWe dont make the rules for what's right or what's beautiful, he thought. We just try to understand them after they already been made. Like trying to describe why a thing is good or why it aint. Take that painting of the woman with the strange smile. Men could talk about light and shadow and what it meant in its time but that wasnt it. That wasnt it at all.\n\nWhen folks speak of things they love they always start the same way. There's just something about it, they say, before they try to explain with bigger words. But you cant never really explain it all. That woman O'Connor knew it. Said some things can only be told in stories cause regular words aint enough. Even when you describe every blessed thing about a book there's still something else. Something that aint got no words. Morality's the same way. Like that feller Wittgenstein said, you cant speak it proper. It's beyond speaking.\n\nHe thought on how both these things, what's right and what's beautiful, they hit a man someplace deep. Someplace you cant point to. Someplace beyond knowing but not beyond feeling. And when it comes to books, well. McKean had it right. Books aint like music or painting. Books carry the weight of right and wrong same as life does. Cant escape values when you're living and cant escape them in stories neither. That's why they matter. That's why they always will.",
            "The land stretched vast and cold beneath a colorless sky, from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the slate waters of Kiel where the Baltic lapped at ancient shores. This was Germany. The same blood coursed through the veins of those who dwelt by the Rhine at Köln as those who walked the stone streets of Dresden where the Elbe cut its path. A people carved from many, yet bound as one.\n\nGermania they called it in the old tongue. The name itself lost to time like footprints in shifting sand, though men argued still over its meaning. Tacitus, that Roman who put words to parchment, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, becoming Germans in the telling. And Caesar before him, who first scratched Germanus into his accounts of war, took it from the Gauls he'd broken. Some said it meant neighbor in that dead language. Some said it came from the spears they carried, dark wooden ger that drank deep of blood. Or maybe it rose from their battle cries that echoed across the forests like the howls of wolves.\n\nTacitus wrote of them in his time, ink flowing black as pitch across the page. Aboriginal, he named them. Untouched. Pure as winter snow. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies? What man would choose such darkness unless born to it?\n\nThe Romans came though. Not to stay but to take. They sent their legions forth into those shadowed lands for amber and iron and flesh for their armies. They came and went like ravens to carrion, while the tribes remained. The Germans dwelt there in the borderlands, trading what the earth gave up to them, selling their sons to march beneath Roman eagles. They endured. They waited. The land was theirs and would remain so when Rome was dust.",
            "The play spoke of masks and lies and the dark truth that a man who wears another's face too long might forget his own. He might wake one morning and find himself gone entirely. Yet to cast off such deceits meant to stand naked before those you'd fooled and some would forgive while others would curse your name into the cold night air till the stars fell.\n\nWhen they changed their skin to wear another's gender it was a deeper thing. A more troubling thing. Like Viola who shed her woman's garments like a snake its skin, seeking shelter in manhood's guise. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she said, her words falling like dead leaves. \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\"\n\nShe walked the razor's edge between worlds, cut off from sisterhood, adrift in a foreign land. And Olivia, God help her, saw only what her eyes told her was true. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words hung in the air like smoke. Even Orsino felt the pull of something he couldn't name: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThere was something raw and primitive in how the deception peeled back layers of desire like old wallpaper, revealing what lay beneath. Olivia's heart beat for Cesario but was it the man she thought she saw or something deeper, something that lived in darker waters? When Sebastian appeared like some twin star in the night sky, she turned to him as if Cesario had been nothing more than a dream. \"A sister, you are she,\" she said to Viola, and just like that the spell was broken, the disguise fell away like ash in the wind.\n\nThey all stood revealed in the harsh light of truth, each carrying their own deceptions like old wounds that wouldn't heal. The play showed us this mirror and asked us to look deep, to see what masks we wore, what lies we told ourselves in the dead of night when no one was watching.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the way they killed. The Ovaherero and the Nama knew. They knew in their bones and in their blood and in the dust that covered everything. The dust that was maybe their own people ground to powder by German boots and German guns.\n\nHe studied the old papers. Yellowed things speaking of schools and learning but the words were like smoke, there and gone and meaning nothing at all. In the east where the sun rose there were African men who could read and write and cipher numbers but in the southwest there was mostly just death and missionaries wandering like lost prophets in the desert vastness. The government built schools for the white children. Fine buildings of stone and wood but for the black children there was nothing. Nothing but dust and wind and the endless sky that didnt care what color a man was.\n\nThe land itself was a kind of school. Teaching things that no book could tell. How to die slow in the desert heat. How to watch your children waste away while white men sat in wooden houses drinking coffee and reading newspapers from Berlin. Fifteen thousand of them by 1913. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their stolen empire.\n\nHe thought about the numbers. Numbers that meant nothing and everything all at once. Five thousand whites in East Africa where the ground was rich and green. Fifteen thousand in the southwest where nothing grew but hate. The missionaries came with their bibles and their promises but their words fell dead in the dust like everything else.\n\nHe'd seen papers written about it all. German papers mostly, old things that smelled of mold and forgetting. Later there were English words too, trying to make sense of it all. But there wasnt no sense to be made. Just the story of men who thought they could own the world and other men who learned different. The hard way. The dead way.\n\nCohen wrote about it. Wrote about the schools and the settlers and why things were different here than there. But maybe it was simpler than all that. Maybe it was just that some places collect darkness like others collect rain. And South West Africa had collected more than its share.",
            "They came across the border like specters in the night, these two nations locked in their dance of death. Fifty-seven years they fought and bled, from 1836 when the first shots rang out across Texas until 1893 when the last echoes died away in the desert air. The war of '46 marked their darkest hour, American boots marching south through Mexican dust, claiming land that stretched far as any man could see. Texas and the Southwest territories fell like ripe fruit into American hands, though the blood price was dear.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a mineshaft. Different gods, different tongues, different ways. Each side carrying old wounds from Spanish and English fathers long dead, wounds that wouldn't heal. Like neighbors everywhere who share a fence and precious little else, they found reasons enough to kill.\n\nSouth of the border lay Catholic crosses and old monarchies, while north stood Protestant churches and democracy, though neither side could claim clean hands. The division between them was like the border itself - stark and unforgiving as the desert sun. Not unlike that later war between America and the Soviets, where men killed each other over ideas written in books they'd never read.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those fifty-seven years, though the real number was higher if you counted every raid and counter-raid along that ragged wound they called a border. Bandits and outlaws moved like coyotes between the two lands, striking at towns on both sides until finally both nations sent their armies to restore what passes for peace in such places.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American coin, and American eyes turned from taking land to taking profit. The guns fell silent but the memory remained, carried in the wind that blows eternal across that stark dividing line, whispering of old hatreds and older blood. Some say you can still hear it, if you listen close enough on a quiet night.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for security that childhood never gave. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always get sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone with nothing much saved and work became a memory. Still am broke down these days. Fifteen years living off government handouts leaves a person with nothing to call their own. Each dawn brings its own battle against fear and shame and uncertainty. Nothing stays fixed no more but one truth remains standing like a dead tree in a burned field - I wouldn't have made it without my people, my blood kin and the few true friends. When the darkness comes it strips away what strength you thought you had.\n\nTruth is there'll always be calamity waiting. Big or small don't matter none. No amount of preparing can shield you when the real storms hit. Too big to weather alone.\n\nPeople talk about getting free of government's rotting grip and I reckon they're right enough. But better we learn to trust each other again than go digging holes in our yards like scared animals. Better we learn to ask for help and give it too.\n\nThey preach about rugged individuals building this land but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing through the hard times was mercy and respect and sharing what little they had. Them pioneers crossing the mountains didn't make it alone.\n\nSo make ready if you want. I done it myself. Got my survival kit with bandages and water tablets and plastic for the windows if the air goes bad. Got lights and batteries and matches sealed against water and food in tins. If you got land to farm and knowledge to keep food through winter then do it. Good idea same as having a wood stove, less you're stacked in apartments like cordwood.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbors. Cause in the end that's all any of us really got.",
            "In the old world, in lands far east where the sun first rises, there lived a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. Not his true name. He walked out from his palace one night leaving all he knew behind him like a snake shedding its skin and when he came back he wasnt the same man that left. Maybe he wasnt a man at all anymore.\n\nThe things he spoke of grew like weeds in mens minds. Twenty five hundred years they grew. Changed and twisted. You could see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters now. Monks in their robes like old wraiths moving through the ceremony. The Buddha never spoke of such things but there they were all the same. The world changes what it touches. Even holy things. Even stone.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some meant harm and others didnt. Like wind wearing down a mountain. Like water cutting through rock. They all left their mark.\n\nWords have power. Internal. External. Hostile. Benign. These words were important. Internal meant those who followed the Buddha's way. External meant those who didnt. Hostile meant those who'd tear it all down. Benign meant those who didnt care either way but changed things all the same. The words would come again and again like a hammer striking an anvil.\n\nAt its heart the religion was simple things. Three jewels they called them. The Buddha himself. The Dhamma which was his word written down in three parts like a tree with three branches. The Sangha which was the people who followed. The writings spoke of deep things. No soul. Suffering that cant be escaped. Nothing lasts. These were the truths they found. Hard truths like iron. They said a man could break free of dying and being born again. Could shed desire like an old coat. Could let go of hate. Could see clear through delusion like looking through clean glass.\n\nThey had rules. Five for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Dont misuse the flesh. Dont poison the mind with drink. The monks had more. Many more. But at the bottom of it all were four truths. Life is suffering. Want causes suffering. Suffering can end. There is a way out."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's gathering, Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman, Catherine powdered white as winter frost. Only at Gatsby's did the colors dare to scream, gaudy as carnival paint. The white kept coming. Down in the bowels of New York, white canyons stretched forever. The names in Gatsby's book gone gray as forgotten headstones. Catherine's building just another slice in an endless white cake of sameness. Plain folk wore these colors like a shroud. Jordan and Daisy's girlhood white as bone. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fell like snow. A gray Italian child by the tracks. The dog-seller gray as yesterday's dreams.\n\nThen Fitzgerald, he took these colors and made them speak. Made them whisper truths about things that mattered. About Daisy most of all. After a long quiet spell he showed her to us, all in white, in that white roadster. And you could see it then. See how she wasn't really a person no more but just something Gatsby wanted. Something he'd built up in his mind like a church made of clouds. The gray of her fur collar, the white of her dress before that final showdown. All of it speaking without words about how empty she was. How she was just another white piece in a white world that Gatsby thought he could make his own.",
            "The county lay blessed by sun and mild days, its soil dark and giving. Fields stretched endless with tomatoes and citrus, the green things that grew low and the tall standing fruits. Men worked the ground here as they always had, though now some called their work organic and kept lists of those who'd wait long months for the yield. The eggs and milk they sold pure and clean, untouched by the poisons of the modern world. Some opened their gates to the wandering folk who'd come to walk the paths or watch the birds wheel overhead, these visitors paying coin for the privilege of seeing how the old ways endured.\n\nThe ground remembered what it had been. Before the white man came with his cattle and his axes the Indians had walked here countless moons, their footsteps quiet in the chaparral and oak woods that bordered what they now called Cleveland National Forest. One hundred and sixty acres it measured, this plot of land, though such measurements meant nothing to those who'd first known it. The rats and frogs and butterflies that dwelt here cared nothing for boundaries, their kinds growing fewer with each passing season, their names now listed in leather-bound books of endangered things.\n\nThey called this the East County Southern Foothills now, though it had worn other names. The homesteaders had come with their dreams of cattle and cordwood, marking their claims in the late century when such things still held meaning. The land bore their marks still, the ghost-traces of grazing paths and stumped trees telling tales of what had been.\n\nThe new farmers who worked such ground found it harder than their forebears, having forsaken the chemical ways. Their hands bled with the weeding and their backs bent with labor that machines might have eased. Yet the earth gave back what was taken, if more slowly, and the wild things returned to land thus tended. Birds came that had not been seen in years, and small creatures made their homes in the uncounted spaces between the rows. But such farming cost dear in coin and sweat, and those who worked the land this way often sought help from those who kept the public purse, trading promises of conservation for the means to keep their dreams alive.",
            "Brothers carry something between them that cant be broke nor bent nor changed. Something that aint got no name except maybe blood but that aint right neither. They carry love and pride and meanness too and jealousy dark as pitch and sometimes worse things still. Aint nobody knows a brother like his own brother does and when they look at each other its like starin into some kind of mirror that shows what lives inside em both. When the world turns mean and cold thats when you see what kind of thing that bond really is. Good or evil it dont matter. It just is what it is.\n\nThe boy called Doodle wasnt meant to live. Born wrong. Heart weak as wet paper. His brother who was older wanted different. Wanted somebody to run with through them swamps. Somebody to climb them old pines out back of the barn. Somebody to race down to Horsehead Landing where the water runs black and deep. But Doodle wasnt none of them things and never would be.\n\nThe older brother he carried darkness in him. Sat there one night with a pillow in his hands thinking bout smothering that baby that wasnt no real brother to him no how. But then that baby smiled. Just smiled like he knew something nobody else did and that darkness it just run out of the older boy like water. Love come in to take its place though he didnt know it then.\n\nPride though. Pride's what ate at him worse than any darkness ever could. Pride's what made him drag that broken little brother through them swamps. Pride's what killed him in the end. When that rain come down like judgment and that little heart give out there wasnt nothing left but that pride laying there in the mud beside his dead brother. Aint no mirror in the world could show him what he really was then. But he knew. Oh yes. He knew.",
            "He'd seen it before, the way the mind works. Like some great machine but made of flesh and blood and sparking with electricity that aint electricity at all but something older. Something that was there before God made light. In the beginning there was the brain and the brain was with God and the brain was God. He thought about how men had tried to understand it. First they said it was like marking in wax. Then like writing on paper. Then like some book. Now they say its like them computers. All of them wrong and right in ways that dont matter.\n\nThe information comes in through the senses. Light and sound and touch transformed into something else. Something electric and chemical both. The brain takes it and changes it over and over, bottom to top and top to bottom like some deranged ladder to heaven. He remembered looking at a black box once. The brain building it up from nothing but light and shadow, borders where black meets white, then knowing it whole, knowing it for what it was before it was fully built. Like seeing a man walking out of the fog piece by piece but knowing it was a man before he was whole.\n\nThe mind decides what matters. Filters through the chaos like a prospector panning for gold. You might be standing in grass up to your knees but you dont see each blade less you're crazy or dying or both. But your name. Your name carries through a crowd like a bullet through smoke.\n\nEverything gets stored away. Different boxes for different things. Some memories last twenty seconds, others last till you die. They say some memories are kept alive by electricity running through the brain like some ghost in a circle. Others get written into the proteins themselves, carved into the meat of your mind like cattle brands. The whole thing ordered like some terrible library. Everything connected to everything else in ways that dont make sense unless you're looking at it right. Chair connects to table connects to wood connects to tree connects to forest connects to darkness connects to death. Everything connected. Everything touching everything else like lovers in the dark.",
            "They called it the great unraveling. In the year of our Lord 2007 the nation fell to its knees like some wounded beast. The money dried up like water in a desert and the houses stood empty and the great towers of commerce crumbled into dust and ash. Men walked the streets with cardboard signs bearing their desperate pleas and children went hungry and the banks stood like tombs of some forgotten civilization.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton. He who sought power like a starving dog seeks meat. The rules that held back the tide of greed were torn down one by one like fenceposts in a storm. Fannie Mae stood at the center of it all like some dark altar where sacrifices were made to the god of profit. Holmes saw it coming. Wrote about it in the papers. But prophets are rarely heeded in their own time.\n\nThey created new kinds of money magic. Paper promises stacked on paper promises. Adjustable-rates and mortgage-backs and collateralized obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The whole country drunk on the wine of easy money. Every man a king in his castle built on sand.\n\nWhen it fell it fell hard. Like watching a mountain come down. The great houses of money - Bear and Merrill and Lehman - they fell like dominoes in a child's game. Four trillion in debt. Numbers so big they lost all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in the desert. Goldman and Morgan survived but they weren't the same. Changed like men who'd seen the face of God and lived. Fannie and Freddie, those twin towers of American dreams, they fell into the government's hands like sick children into a father's arms.\n\nThe nation watched it all happen like a man watching his house burn. Helpless. Knowing that something precious was being lost and not knowing how to stop it. The ashes of that fire still float on the wind. Still settle in our lungs when we breathe. Still coat everything we touch with the dust of broken dreams.",
            "The words lay cold and dead on the page like winter birds fallen from their perch. Stories told in haste, rushing past the marrow of life itself, past the very heart of what makes a tale worth the telling. He knew better. Knew it deep in that place where knowing comes before words.\n\nThe writer sits alone in the dark. Screen casting its pale glow like moonlight through dirty glass. Words come but they aint right words. Aint true words. Just empty vessels floating on a sea of white nothing.\n\nShow dont tell they say. As if showing and telling weren't both just different kinds of lies we tell ourselves about the truth. But there's truth and there's Truth and knowing the difference is what separates them that can write from them that just put words on paper.\n\nTake the man at the gas station. Night manager with jet fuel still running through his veins from his Air Force days. Two wives gone like smoke in the wind. No children to carry his name. Every weekend he takes his pole down to the creek and sits watching the water move past, dreaming of owning that station someday. This morning he ate eggs benedict cause sometimes a man needs something more than just food to fill the empty spaces.\n\nBut that aint telling his story. That's just facts lined up like dead soldiers after the battle. His real story's in how his hands shake sometimes when planes fly over too low. How he touches the counter where his second wife used to lean while she drank her coffee. The way he watches young fathers with their children and his eyes go distant like he's seeing something far away that aint there no more.\n\nStories need meat on their bones. Need blood in their veins. Need to breathe and hurt and live. Otherwise they're just words. Just marks on a page. Signifying nothing.",
            "He watched the news come in through the static and glow of the television set, images flashing like fever dreams across the screen. First light in Columbus and already the darkness had come. A man named Hostettler, face twisted and pale as bone in his mugshot, had put knife to wife in Ashley. Evil radiating from him like heat from summer pavement. They gave it two minutes. No more.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone from this world now. Shot down in Sharon Woods, critical they said. SWAT teams moving through the shadows like wraiths but no killer found. Brief telling, like most stories of the dark-skinned dead. He'd seen it before, how the pale faces lingered longer on the screen, their stories told and retold until they echoed through the empty spaces of the morning broadcasts.\n\nWord came of a bullet hole in a flying machine, a Med-Flight helicopter pierced by twenty-two caliber lead. Reward money promised, five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. Then weather, storms gathering in the distance like God's own fury, temperatures holding in the eighties. Quick words meant to keep viewers chained to their sets.\n\nThey spoke of robbery next. UDF store on Clime Road. Dark man in dark clothes, tall and lean as a winter tree. The words lingered too long on his blackness, like oil spreading across clear water.\n\nLast came tale of Rodriguez, drug lord from Texas lands. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if the counting made the time more heavy. Hispanic, they called him, though it mattered none to the weight of his chains or the depth of his cell.\n\nThe news rolled on like that, stories of darkness and light, good and evil, all mixed together in the gray morning air of Columbus, Ohio. Each tale carrying its own weight of truth and prejudice, like ash falling soft and steady on the ruins of what once was.",
            "He studied the paper before him, figures stark and cold against the white expanse like bones bleached in desert sun. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world but everything to those who'd come before. He thought about how men had once traded these ethereal things, these fragments of ownership passed from hand to hand like playing cards in some vast game none truly understood.\n\nThe numbers lay there like auguries. Ten holdings, principal among them, accounting for sixty-three point five eight percent of the whole. He'd seen such figures before, in the time before the darkness came. In that other world where men spoke of betas and returns and sharp ratios like they were talking about living things.\n\nHe remembered the calculations. Cold arithmetic that spoke of a return six point eleven percent higher than the fund itself. A beta point twelve lower. Numbers that danced and shifted in the fluorescent light of trading terminals now long dead and dark. The kind of terminals that had once lit up office buildings like stars in the night sky.\n\nThey'd done studies, compared means. Statistical differences they called them, though statistics meant nothing now in this gray world where survival meant more than percentage points and standard deviations. But he remembered how they'd normalized the figures to one hundred percent, trying to divine some truth from the chaos of numbers.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men had once believed they could spread their risk across many holdings like a farmer planting different crops in case one failed. But in the end it hadn't mattered. Nothing had mattered except survival.\n\nThe paper spoke of configurations, optimal solutions, better ways to arrange these ten holdings like pieces on some financial chessboard. But he knew now that all such games were dust. Just dust and ashes in a world where paper money burned as easy as paper dreams.\n\nHe folded the document carefully, tucked it away in his coat. Maybe someday someone would care about such things again. About returns and ratios and statistical significance. But not today. Today there were only the cold numbers, the empty calculations, and the long gray dusk of a world that had moved on.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and saw how the numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month, a thing that brought no comfort. The winter had come to that New England place as it always did, merciless and gray, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that moved across them. December it was, or what passed for December in these times, when the semester drew its last rasping breath and the people there grew harried with their gradebooks and their papers and their tasks that could not wait. The logging of miles became a thing forgotten, like so many things are forgotten in this world.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying, students and teachers alike vanishing into whatever darkness waited for them beyond the campus borders. When they returned in that bitter January the numbers remained low, a fact plain as bones beneath skin, but February proved worse still. Perhaps it was the nature of such things that the fire burns bright at first then dims to coals and ash, as all fires must.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate gambit to breathe life back into the dying thing. It worked after a fashion, the numbers rising like smoke from a rekindled flame. But the truth remained that breaks and holidays were like wounds in the project's flesh, bleeding away whatever momentum they'd gained.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in how people clung to their automobiles like talismans of freedom, a thing woven into the fabric of who they were. They tried to combat this with gifts - paper promises for food and drink and books and the comforts of massage. But they knew, or came to know, that bigger prizes might have served better. A bicycle perhaps, or one of them hybrid cars that promised salvation from the old ways. If they'd done thus, announced each greater prize like prophets speaking of coming glory, maybe them numbers wouldn't have fallen so. Maybe them people would've kept writing in their logs, kept leaving their cars behind. But they hadn't done that thing, and now they could only look at Figure 17 and wonder at what might have been.",
            "I set to watching them all, them trick films in the Library of Congress, fifteen of them made from 1895 to 1901 in Edison's workshop. Strange things they was, built on illusions and cuts that fooled the eye like some dark magic. Most was alike in their ways but some that came later stood apart like pale riders on a darker plain. They was bound to stages mostly, shot straight on like you was watching a show through a window. Camera didnt move none. Just watched with its glass eye, keeping its distance. One shot was all they needed back then. One shot was all there was.\n\nThe stage was their world entire. Built inside like a box, everything framed up like some theatrical performance where the devils themselves might dance. Camera stood witness, unmoved, like a judge at his bench. This way of doing came from the old shows, the vaudeville acts and magicians who'd stand before crowds and make things appear and vanish like smoke. The players in these films moved sideways across the frame like marionettes on invisible strings. Take that film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, made in 1900. Josh and them others crossing back and forth like lost souls, never coming closer, never retreating, just moving along that one line God gave them to walk.\n\nThey kept their distance from the camera too. No close looks at faces, just full bodies or half-bodies if you was lucky. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some burned out theatre. The players stayed in their place, keeping to the middle ground like they was afraid of what might happen if they got too close to that glass eye watching them.\n\nMost of these films was short, no longer than a minute. One shot was all they got, all they needed to show their tricks. Wasnt no story to tell really, just magic and vanishing and people switching places like specters in the night. But that one shot wasnt really one shot at all. It was pieces stitched together like some kind of patchwork quilt, hiding the seams where the magic happened. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots from 1895, if you look close enough with eyes that know what they're seeing, you can spot where they switched the living queen for the dead one, though they tried to hide it like a sin.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what the scholars say. Some curse it and some praise it and some say it aint got no more depth than a dried up creek bed while others call it terrible and sublime like the voice of God in thunder. That first tale, Walpole's Castle of Otranto, it took what was ancient and what was modern and wed them together like some unholy marriage, birthing something that weren't quite either.\n\nThe old theatrical ways and the new natural ones merged in what he called his Gothic Story. Gothic itself was a word that had wandered through time like some homeless ghost, touching on peoples and buildings and times long dead, marking each with its cold finger. By Walpole's time folks saw it as something primitive, backwards, like finding arrowheads in freshly plowed fields. But that marriage of the theatrical gothic with the intimate knowing that novels give, that's what made it last. Made it both dead and living at once, like some creature that can't decide whether to breathe or not.\n\nChivalry runs through these tales like blood through veins. The medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got changed but not killed in Otranto. Writers like Walpole, they saw something missing in their world, something that used to be there in those old knights with their honor and their courage. They looked back at that gothic past like a man might look at paradise after being cast out. Walpole himself was caught in political storms, watching his world turn dark and cold. Maybe he thought something had gone out of people, some essential goodness that used to live in men's hearts back in those gothic times. You can see it in how he writes Frederic, a character carved from old virtues like a statue from stone. Before you even meet him you know what he is - prince, sufferer, warrior against infidels. But like all things gothic, it's too much, like a fire built too high, threatening to burn down the very house it means to warm.",
            "The chain moves like a river through the dark country of commerce, from the raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was Keith Oliver who gave it a name in 1982 though the thing itself was ancient as trade itself. Six pillars hold it up like some old temple to modern gods. Production and supply and inventory and location and the movement of things and the knowing of things. These are the bones of it.\n\nProduction stands first among them like some primordial force. It begins with the watching, always the watching. Men in offices studying the numbers on screens like augurs reading entrails, trying to divine what the people want. The market speaks in whispers and shouts and they who would survive must learn its tongue. Then comes the deciding. What to make and how much and where to make it. Choosing wrong can bleed a company dry sure as any wound.\n\nHe remembered the time at Walmart and Target both, them places with their books of rules thick as bibles. Every little thing wrote down just so. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take the boxes off the trucks. Everything had its way and its place. The companies knew that chaos was always waiting, patient as death, and only order could keep it at bay.\n\nSupply comes after, like the shadow of production. Men in rooms making choices about what they can do and what they must let others do. Every factory has its own ways, its own machines humming in the fluorescent light, its own hands moving in ancient rhythms. Sometimes they send the work away to other places, chasing that thing they call velocity. Velocity, he thought. Just a fancy word for being quick and being cheap all at once, like it was something you could catch and hold.\n\nThe managers move through it all like priests of some new religion, making their choices, watching the numbers dance across their screens. They parse the mysteries of supply and demand like old prophets reading signs in the desert sky. And always the chain moves on, endless as a river, carrying the things of the world from hand to hand through the darkness of time.",
            "They come in the night these books of old. Victorian they called them. Full of words and gilt and fancy folk who dined with silver and lived in houses tall as God. But there was two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Dark books. Strange books. Books that carried mystery in their bones like some old disease that wont let go. Made the people in them more real somehow. More true.\n\nIn Oliver there was dreams. Dark dreams that come like black water rising. The boy dreaming of Sikes and Crackit arguing, their words real as knife blades in the night. Then the gunshot. Then the screaming. Lights like fever dreams dancing in his head while something drug him away through the dark. Through it all the pain come. Come and stayed. Like it had found a home in him and meant to stay forever.\n\nThese dreams they showed what the boy was inside. What ate at him in the deep night. How he knew things aint right but couldn't do nothing about it. When they shot him he lived it twice. Once in the world and once in his head. In the dream he was powerless. Some force moving him like a puppet on strings while pain gnawed at him steady as hunger. Pain that weren't sharp no more but dull like an old knife. Mixed up with fear now instead of surprise.\n\nThe boy had no control. Never did. Someone else's will moving him through the world like a leaf in the wind. The shooting showed it plain. Even with death coming he couldn't fight. Like old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that used to know how to struggle against the dark. Now he just let it come. Let it take him where it would.\n\nTime itself got strange. Day becoming night becoming day again. No difference between them anymore. Just long dark silence and hours that ran like water through your fingers. No catching them. No holding on.",
            "There was a time I minded children. Not my own but others. Small ones with dark eyes who couldn't read the words before them. One boy, Adrian they called him, struggled worse than most. He'd stare at the letters like they were dead things. Some marks he knew and others were foreign to him like tracks in snow that told no story he could read.\n\nThe boy spoke English pure as winter air but something was wrong in him. You could see it in how his eyes moved across the page, searching, lost. His people came from south of here where the language was different but that wasn't it. Not all of it.\n\nHis mother came one day. She stood in the doorway like a dark bird, speaking no English, only the tongue of her homeland. We traded broken words, her Spanish and mine mixing like oil and water, but it was enough. The truth hit me then like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough but the letters were strangers to him. The English alphabet might as well have been hieroglyphs carved in stone.\n\nI tell this tale not for its own sake but for what lies beneath. Here in California we got us a wall between languages, invisible but real as concrete. Sometimes it hides in plain sight. A child might speak English clean as morning but still stumble when the words are laid before him on the page. We all know this truth but knowing ain't fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him his letters, show him how the sounds matched up. But for them that barely speak English at all, there ain't no simple answer. Dual language learning, immersion, tutors, ESL - none of these alone is enough. Like a house needs all its walls, we need all these things together.\n\nThe dual language way, that's something worth considering. Not just for them that speak Spanish first but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than their peers, though some folk fear it's wasting time and money. That fear's as hollow as a dead tree. Put these programs in every classroom and watch them all grow stronger. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. Just need some folk who can bridge that gap, help them cross that river from one language to the other.",
            "Most all of us get told when we're young that there's somethin out there bigger than ourselves. Bigger than what we can know. Some get sent off to learn about it in buildings with crosses hung on em and some to temples with stars and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth might be there. Most take to the god their momma and daddy gave em but others cast it off like a snake sheds its skin, saying there aint nothing in this world except what they can see with their own eyes. We pick up beliefs like a man picks up stones, holding em for a spell then casting em aside for different ones. Whatever path we take we're all just trying to find our way through it. Looking for some kind of light in all that darkness. Something to lead us out.\n\nMy daddy told me once he loved cardinals best of all the birds. We was sitting on the porch, listening to the rain beating down on that old tin roof while we smoked. The gutters was running over, drowning them little flowers my momma had planted years back. He just stared out into that rain like he was looking for something that wasnt there no more. He'd gotten real thin by then. His clothes just hanging on him like they was hung on a wire fence. His hair had gone mostly too, just wisps of what used to be. He wouldnt look at me. I wanted to tell him how much I'd miss him but the words wouldnt come cause saying em would make it all too real. So I just hugged him and moved my chair closer and we both watched that June rain falling in the dark.\n\nHe died that December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had given him medicine that didnt help none except to keep him suffering longer than he should of. I lay in my bed them nights wondering what kind of God would do such a thing. I said no prayers. If there was a God up there he wasnt listening to the likes of me no more.\n\nI didnt want to watch him go. So I didnt. Couldnt bear to see the life that made me while it was ending. I wanted to keep him like he was. Like he lived. Not like he died. I knew him better than all of em did and knew he wouldnt want his boy watching him slip away. So I just lay there in my bed. Curled up like some wounded animal. Waiting three days for word that never came.\n\nNobody even called to tell me he was gone.",
            "He come riding out of the east, John Taylor of Caroline did, bearing with him notions of Republic and freedom that would mark him in the years to come. A man of the soil first and foremost though his hands had known both dirt and politics and his mind knew the weight of both. The land shaped him and his thoughts on liberty and governance flowed from that selfsame earth like water from a spring.\n\nThe man believed America stood at a crossroads where no traditions held sway and where men might build something pure and true from nothing but their own conviction. Natural rights, he said, was like a string of beads. Break one and watch the rest scatter to the wind. These things must stand beyond the reach of any government hand. He spoke of how in nature the strong and cunning prospered but civilization must find another way.\n\nTaylor knew the darkness that dwelt in men's hearts. Good and evil to him were fixed as stars. Government being the work of men must carry both their virtues and their sins, he wrote in those days. Good principles protected what a man owned, made the land prosper, kept the moneylenders at bay. Self-interest drove all men but turned poison when it led to parasites feeding off the common good. Even the best government needed watching like a wolf at the door.\n\nLike others of his kind he held to the Constitution's words strict and true. The federal power must be kept small, bound tight by chains of law. A costly government turns tyrant quick as summer lightning, he'd say. But words alone could corrupt without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states and not one nation bound.\n\nHe saw the land and the men who worked it as the bedrock of all liberty. His thoughts on sovereignty and law and courts all flowed from this well. The old agriculturalist knew that freedom grew from the soil like wheat from seed, and all his days he fought to keep that harvest pure.",
            "He stood there staring down. Empty and cold and studying what lay before him without thought or feeling or connection to any deeper meaning that might have dwelt in the depths of his mind. Thoughts came and went like wind through dead grass. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless.\n\nHe remembered a book. An old thing with dogeared pages that spoke of how to make marks on paper seem real. The artist who'd told him of it was long dead now. The book taught about frames. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to understand. How to take the vastness of what lay before you and cut it down to size. Like taking a knife to God's own canvas.\n\nBut there was no frame for this. No way to section off what lay before him in that porcelain bowl. It was what it was and nothing more. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was brown. Deep and dark and final. The color of the earth when it takes back what's its own.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Cold chrome against skin. Muscles tensed and relaxed like a gunfighter's before the draw. Water moved in its ancient circles, clear as tears. Matter broke away and scattered like ash in the wind. He pulled the handle again. Harder this time. Desperate maybe. But the brown mass clung there like something dead that refused to be buried.\n\nHe stood in his green tie that choked at his throat like a hangman's rope. Feet planted like a man about to be shot. The mop beside him a witness to what was to come. The fluorescent lights of the Rite Aid bathroom hummed overhead like the voice of some minor god. He pulled paper from the roll and wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Then he reached down into those cold waters like a man reaching into his own grave.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in numbers cold and merciless as winter. The doctors at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark chambers of youth. But there's more to it than that. More than just the raw inexperience that sends metal coffins spinning off blacktops and rolling through ditches in the dead of night.\n\nHe'd seen them. The young ones. Packed like cattle in their father's cars, laughing and burning rubber down empty streets. The California men who study such things drew lines between the numbers. Between the dead and the living. Between the age of the passenger and the metal twisted round telephone poles.\n\nThe state men tried to fix it with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young could drive and times when they couldn't. But paper burns and laws are just words written in ash.\n\nThe truth was simpler. Darker. The youngest ones weren't ready. Not by any measure man could devise. Zuckerman, the mind doctor, he knew. Even eighteen summers wasn't enough. They sought the thrill like animals seeking water in drought. The rush of speed and the taste of danger sweet as stolen wine on their tongues.\n\nMore would die. That was certain as sunrise. The children of the boom times were coming of age and they'd flood the roads like locusts. Millions strong by 2010. Each one carrying death in their pocket like a lucky coin.\n\nThe answer lay in waiting. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots but keep them from the wheel until eighteen winters had passed. Make them prove themselves under watching eyes. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who'd seen enough sunsets to know better. Make it the same in every state, from sea to shining sea. One law for all the young.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't even original. But neither was death, and it kept coming all the same.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents yellowed and curled at the edges like old photographs. Words about the brain and how it fails us. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, they called it. CAPD. Letters that meant nothing and everything to them that suffered it.\n\nThe disorder lived in the spaces between hearing and knowing. In the neural pathways where sound becomes meaning. These people could hear just fine but their brains betrayed them, scrambling the signals like a radio caught between stations. Not deaf but something else. Something worse maybe.\n\nHe remembered the first ones who found it, Italian doctors in the old world. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari. Names like incantations. They worked with broken children in 1954, children whose ears worked but whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Kimura came later with his tests, splitting sounds between ears like a man splitting wood.\n\nThe afflicted ones walked through the world like ghosts. Couldn't tell where sounds came from. Couldn't separate one voice from another in a crowd. Couldn't hear the mockery in a voice or the love in it neither. Sound washed over them like waves, drowning meaning in its wake.\n\nThey tested for it now with machines and questionnaires. Audiologists and speech doctors watching patients like scientists watch rats in a maze. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard, recording the signals that bounced around inside the skull like echoes in a cave.\n\nThe science was imperfect. Like trying to catch smoke in your hands. The doctors watched and waited and measured but still they couldn't say why some brains betrayed their owners this way. Why some folks could hear the world but couldn't understand what it was telling them.\n\nHe thought about how the world must look to them. All sound and fury signifying nothing. Walking through life like being underwater, everything muffled and strange. The brain playing tricks like a devil with a deck of cards.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the office thinking on what path to follow. Social work. The word itself carried weight like old stones. Children who had been broke and bent by the ones meant to shelter them. Families gone wrong in the head and heart both. Service and respect and ethics. Words that meant something once and would mean something again if he had his way.\n\nHe remembered them all. The lost ones in high school and after. Running from things they couldn't name. Drowning their demons in whatever poison they could find. That's what led him to study the mind at Piedmont. Learning the ways people break and mend and break again.\n\nThen there was the boy. Sixteen and scared and perched on a stranger's couch like a wounded bird. Running from hands that should have loved but chose to harm instead. He went to that house the next day. Talked to the law standing in that yard. Parents inside making excuses like they always do. Simple disputes they called it. Nothing simple about it. That's when he knew what path lay before him.\n\nJustice was another matter. A word that carried different weight for different folk. Society claiming to care for the individual while grinding down anyone who stood apart. He never did cotton to that. Through all his schooling he fought against the sameness they tried to press on him. Hair bright as poison. Metal in his ears past what folks thought proper. Standing with them that society said weren't natural or right. Fighting the old hatreds wherever they showed their face.\n\nThe world had gone wrong somewhere. Turned mean and small. But there were still those who'd stand against it. Still those who'd help the broken ones. Still those who'd fight for what's right even when right was hard to find in all the darkness. He aimed to be one of them. That's all a man could do in times like these.",
            "Dark now and the mind turns to sleep and the absence of it. To the deep biological rhythms that govern us like some ancient timepiece buried in the flesh. There are models they say. Ways of seeing. The biological and the sociocultural lying there in the dark like twin specters haunting the edges of consciousness.\n\nSleep comes or it dont. Some nights the darkness stretches endless and the mind wont quiet and you lie there counting the hours like beads on a rosary. They got names for it now. Classifications. Primary disorders and secondary ones and ones that aint got proper names at all. Dyssomnias. Parasomnias. Words that taste of dust and medical texts. But what they mean is simple enough. The inability to sleep or to stay awake or to keep from walking in your sleep like some creature possessed.\n\nDeep in the hypothalamus there are neurons that decide whether we wake or sleep. Little messengers carrying their cargo of orexin through the brain like workers in some vast biological factory. They found it first in mice. Always the mice. The GABAB receptors sitting there like gatekeepers, deciding who passes and who dont. Give them the right signal and sleep comes. Block them and the mind stays wakeful. Simple as that. Or maybe not so simple.\n\nThe scientists talk about phenotypes and agonists and receptor sites but what they're really talking about is inheritance. The dark gift passed down through blood and bone from parent to child. Some folks just born to lie awake while the rest of the world sleeps. Born to watch the darkness gather and spread like ink across a page. And what that means in the real world aint hard to figure. Try holding down a job when you cant sleep. Try learning when your mind is full of cotton and static. Try living in a world built for people who close their eyes at night and find peace.\n\nThey got studies. Always more studies. But what they really mean is that some folks is cursed to wakefulness and some aint. And all the scientific words in the world dont change that simple truth.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across empty ballfields and the stadium stands black against the sky. The walking was hard. Twenty-five minutes or more to Willard if the weather held, longer when it didnt. And the weather rarely held in State College.\n\nTalked once with a man who'd walked these grounds before. Not much older than me but he spoke of vast empty spaces where now buildings rose like concrete mountains. New Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks lined up like headstones. The campus growing like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the walking harder with each passing season. What's to be done about the getting around? The bicycle stands as answer but it aint enough by itself. Students got to ride them and the grounds got to be made right for the riding.\n\nFriend of mine took up the bike again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said it was the only true way to move across this world. Good for the body and efficient besides. Bowl of morning gruel and some honest sweat'll carry you thirty miles or more. Living off campus now myself, far as any dorm. Getting that bike was the smartest thing I done. Classes in Thomas building, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest shot there is but mean country to cross, bike or no.\n\nWalking's got its merits true enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike there'd be nothing but walking and I cant spare the hours. Thirty, forty minutes extra every day just getting to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone from every week, vanished like smoke. Add in all the other walking - classes, meetings, everything else a body's got to do - and time bleeds away like water in sand.\n\nThe road goes ever on. The buildings rise. The campus spreads like some dark stain across the valley. But the bicycle remains, waiting patient as stone for them as would use it. Waiting to carry us through this concrete wilderness we built ourselves.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was. The book spoke of a man named Huxley who saw what was coming long before others did. Who wrote of a world where men were no more than cattle. Where they were bred and shaped and molded like clay figures in some godless kiln. Each made the same. Each the same as the last. A world of numbers and machines and the cold mathematics of control.\n\nThe words spoke of classes of men. Of Alphas and Betas and the rest below them like rungs on some terrible ladder descending into darkness. Each believing they were content. Each believing they were free. But they weren't free. They were prisoners who didn't know they were in chains. Who couldn't feel the iron that bound them.\n\nHe thought about how they lived in that world. No love between them. No real feeling at all. Just the endless pursuit of pleasure like animals rutting in the dirt. The men speaking of women like they were nothing but flesh. The women speaking of coupling like it was no more meaningful than eating or sleeping. All of them moving through their days like sleepwalkers. Like the dead.\n\nThe Controller watched over them all. Like some dark god in a high tower. Keeping them docile with drugs and pleasure and empty words pumped into their heads while they slept. Words that told them to buy and spend and want and need. Never to think. Never to question. Never to wake up from the dream they were living.\n\nHe thought about how the ones at the bottom never knew they were at the bottom. How they were told they were special and important so long as they kept working and buying and doing what they were told. Like sheep being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThe words spoke of Marx too. Of how he saw this coming in his own way. How he knew that men would be made blind to their own chains. How they would learn to love their prison if you built it right. If you made it shine bright enough.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark. Thinking about how sometimes a man can see the future coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible and true.",
            "Four years back I set to learning of Islam at the college. Dark questions hung in that room like smoke, chief among them whether Islam bore violence in its heart. The query weighs heavier now than it did then. Since those towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a strange sort of reverence. Back then none would have believed a man named Barack Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could stand for president of this land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands against what history speaks of him. In my knowing he was a man of the sword, bringing tribes to heel and marking their foreheads with his faith. Yet these pages paint him a lamb, humbled and misunderstood, while converts came to him like moths to flame, seeing truth in his words.\n\nThere's something that mirrors Christ in these tales, something that makes the blood run cold. They tell how he took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men. The words are crafted careful-like, showing him humble, needing no proof of his calling, living quiet among his miracles. This is the deepest wrong, for it dims the light of Jesus, stealing His glory to dress another man.\n\nThe book carries tales meant to witness how men came willing to Islam, but they're hollow things, passed mouth to mouth like stories round a fire. Each teller claims he heard it from another who heard it from another still, till the truth is thin as smoke. They meant these chains of telling to strengthen their words but they only made them weaker, like a rope frayed to breaking.\n\nWhat burns worst is how they dress Muhammad in robes of gentleness and wisdom, making him holy and meek. But history speaks other words, darker words, and I wonder if those who follow him now know the true path he walked to power, marked in blood and iron across the sands.",
            "They'd left his words behind like tracks in the sand, washed away by time and the tides of men's thoughts that came after. The truth of it lay bare and cold as bones in the desert. Each passing year drew them further from what he'd meant, like a compass needle spinning wild and lost from true north.\n\nThe world now carried some new thing in it. A awakening maybe. Progressive notions spreading like wildfire through dry timber while the old guard stood fast against change, clutching their father's beliefs like old photographs yellowed and creased. But their numbers had grown thin. Time would see to that.\n\nAmong the faithful there stirred a hunger. A need to strip away the layers men had wrapped around his words like burial cloths, seeking what lay beneath. It would come slow as winter thaw but sure as death: a great undoing. The theological clock spinning backwards through time, peeling away doctrine like dead skin until nothing remained but his raw truth, spoken before others claimed to speak for him.\n\nWhen it came it would sweep through the old countries like a dust storm, leaving changed men in its wake. The church would abide, steering souls through the tempest, but something else would happen. The wild spread of beliefs would draw back together like mercury, forming one pure silver drop. Different tongues speaking the same words. Different paths leading to the same door.\n\nHistory showed such reversals. Rome that once fed Christians to lions later knelt before the cross. A nation built on slavery now led by the sons of slaves. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThey'd read his words anew, seeing through the literal to the truth beneath, like looking past the surface of still water to the depths below. But first they had to understand what came before, back when there was only Judaism under Roman rule, when the faithful split like light through a prism - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who worked the land and watched and waited.",
            "They was greedy souls all of them. Deep in their hearts where the darkness dwells and where no light could reach. Each man lookin out for hisself and damn the rest to whatever hell they might find. The Jungle showed it plain as day and there wasnt no denyin it. Them factory owners and their managers stood atop their empire of bone and blood and looked down on the masses below like gods in their heaven.\n\nThem great factories rose up black against the sky like monuments to man's own wickedness. The chimneys belched forth their poison, streams of smoke writhin like serpents across the horizon till they disappeared into nothin. The owners they didnt care none about what damage they wrought. Not to man nor beast nor the very earth itself. The waste from them stockyards run thick with blood and worse, poolin in ditches and drainin into the ground like some unholy communion.\n\nThe workers was just meat to them. Numbers on a page. Expendable as the hogs they butchered. There aint no loyalty in a place where a dollar holds more worth than a man's life, one fella said. They'd work em till they dropped and then cast em aside like spent shells. No warnin. No mercy. Just the cold calculation of profit and loss written in ledgers stained with the blood of the workin poor.\n\nWeren't no law to protect em neither. Not then. The factories was kingdoms unto themselves and them that ruled em was cruel sovereigns indeed. They drove their subjects harder and harder, crackin the whip till flesh gave way to bone. The people what lived there in them shadowlands round Packingtown, they was expected to endure. To suffer. To die. Wasnt no help comin. The unions that formed was just wolves in different clothin, feedin off the desperation of them they claimed to protect.\n\nThey called em slaves and that's what they was. A mass of foreign flesh hangin by threads over the abyss of starvation, their very lives dependent on the whims of men who was brutal as any slave driver that ever lived. In such darkness immorality bloomed like some poisonous flower, inevitable as sunrise, prevalent as death itself. That's what the system bred. That's what it fed on. The bones of the poor ground to dust beneath the wheels of progress.",
            "He walked through the pages of old books seeking Thulé like a man seeking water in the wastes. The words lay there dead and cold on yellowed paper. Virgil had writ of it first they said. Some frozen place beyond the edges of maps where nothing lived and nothing died. But there was another who knew of such places. A German. His books carried across black waters in the holds of darker ships.\n\nThe boy Poe he knew these words. Knew them like he knew the taste of spirits burning down his throat in the midnight hours. Knew them like he knew the faces of the dead. There was this German Goethe who wrote of kings and death and love lost to the void. Wrote of a king whose woman died and left him nothing but a cup to drink his grief from. The king he gave away his kingdom piece by piece save for that cup that cup that cup until at last he stood upon the edge of all things and cast it into the waters below. Then he closed his eyes and followed after.\n\nThese were the stories that fed the darkness in Poe's mind. Fed it like wood feeds fire until it blazed up and scorched the pages he put his pen to. He wrote of Thulé twice. Once in a tale of pits and pendulums and once in verses that spoke of dreams. But these were not sweet dreams. No. These were dreams of ash and bone where dead friends walked and colors bled away to grey and nothing was as it seemed or should be.\n\nYou could lay these words side by side. The German's king and Poe's dreamer. Same darkness. Same loss. Same emptiness eating at the edges of the world. Like brothers separated by an ocean of time and ink but carrying the same blood in their veins. The same poison in their cups.\n\nPoe knew of Goethe. Had to know. The German's words were everywhere then like birds scattered by a storm. And Tennyson. Tennyson who Poe held high spoke of him. Said things that echoed in the chambers of Poe's mind until they found their way onto his pages transformed into something darker still. Something that bore his mark like a brand burned into flesh.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office eating while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold tile floor like some pale viscous blood. The fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow upon it. Twice they came to him. First Wayne and then the Haddigan woman. Each time he waved them away like bothersome flies, said he had no time for such things, though time was all he had in abundance as he sat there shoveling food into his mouth.\n\nThe woman who fell came after. Palmer was her name though names meant little now. She lay there on the floor where five others had fallen before her in that cursed year of 2009, her back twisted and broken like a sapling in a storm. The law spoke of conscious disregard and despicable conduct but these were just words written in books by men who had never watched a person fall, never heard the wet sound of flesh meeting tile, never seen the way the fluorescent lights reflected off spilled applesauce like moon on water.\n\nThe judge would have to decide if this warranted punishment beyond mere compensation. The California code spoke in cold terms - oppression, fraud, malice. Section 3294 subsection a, as if such clinical precision could capture the moment when a man chooses his dinner over another's safety. The courts had seen such things before. They knew that malice lived in the space between knowing and doing, in that moment when a man becomes aware of danger and chooses to let it be.\n\nSix times they had fallen in that store. Six times the floor had reached up to claim them. And still the manager sat in his office, eating. The law would have its say but the truth was simpler than statutes. A man had chosen himself over others. Had known what might come and let it come anyway. The courts would speak of willful and conscious disregard but what they meant was this: a man who would watch others fall while he ate his dinner in peace.",
            "The wanting came like a fever. Started when she was fourteen and never left, not even three years on. Not a thing she needed but a person, though no boy ever stirred her blood. They came round sure enough, awkward and fumbling in their courtship like blind animals in the night, but she felt nothing. She studied this peculiarity like some old text written in a dead language, turning it over in her mind year after year but finding no truth in it.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her folks were peaceful people who moved through rooms like ghosts, their arguments rare as rain in drought. When words did come they were about the girl's wild spirit, untamed and burning bright against their pale existence. She carried something fierce in her that set her apart from their quiet ways, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThe scream tore through the silence like a blade. Kitchen way. Her mother's voice twisted into something raw and wrong. The girl's boots scraped floorboards as she ran, heart hammering against ribs. Mama lay crumpled on cold tile, each breath carrying pain like a curse. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Hospital, her mother whispered through clenched teeth. The word came broken and desperate.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms built from years of labor. Carried her like something precious and fragile to the waiting car, laid her across the backseat. The hospital rose up ahead like some concrete monster waiting to swallow them whole.\n\nInside smelled of death and chemicals and fear but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared from nowhere, wheeling out a stretcher like a funeral bier. They took her mother away down fluorescent-lit corridors while the girl stood helpless, watching the space where she had been.\n\nLater they told her about the stepstool, the high cabinet, the reaching. How gravity claims all things in the end. The vase she'd been reaching for lay shattered on the kitchen floor, forgotten in the chaos that followed.",
            "They set out to find truth in numbers and blood. The women, all of them nurses, seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six of them scattered across eleven states like wind-blown seeds. None had the heart sickness or the sugar disease when they began. They were young then, thirty eight to sixty three years old, though time would mark them same as it marks all things living.\n\nThe Mediterranean way they called it. Ancient as the stones there. Fruits and grains and fish from the old waters. The flesh of beasts used sparingly. Oil pressed from olives. Wine in moderation like the old ones drank. Six times over twenty years they wrote down what passed their lips, documented in ledgers like cemetery plots. Most stayed true to the telling, year after year, their words becoming numbers becoming truth.\n\nThe counters of the dead kept their books well. When a heart failed or a vessel burst in the brain they knew. They confirmed it in hospital records or death papers or the cold tables where the dead lay opened. Some they called probable when no proof could be found but they counted them too, these ghosts in the data.\n\nThey measured everything. Weight and smoke and pills. Whether the women's cycles still came or had stopped like dried streams. Whether they moved their bodies in leisure or sat still as stones. The numbers grew like cities of paper.\n\nTwenty years passed. Two thousand three hundred ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred sixty three minds drowned in their own rivers of blood. One thousand seventy seven souls crossed over from these causes combined. But those who ate like the ancients ate, who followed the old ways, they endured. Their hearts stayed stronger, their blood flowed true. The numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert - eating as their ancestors ate meant walking longer in the light.\n\nThe counters of the dead had found their truth. It lay in olive groves and fishing boats and bread baked from ancient grain. It lay in the wisdom of the old ones who knew how to eat, how to live, how to keep death waiting a little longer at the door.",
            "The cardboard sign held aloft in her hands spoke of Hitler and Burma. Just words scrawled in black marker but they carried weight like stone tablets. The girl who'd once played in that movie about the pregnant child stood alone at the corner where the streets met. The wind taking at her coat.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A place of soldiers and death and temples rising out of the morning mist like ancient bones. The junta had come in the night with their rifles and their doctrine and they'd stayed. Soldiers walking the streets like prophets of some new dead god. The year was 2007 when the monks came. Orange robes like flame against the gray concrete. They called it the Saffron Revolution but revolutions dont always end in victory. Sometimes they end in blood.\n\nThe military came for them in the dark. Ransacking the temples like vandals in some forgotten age. They drove out the foreign writers and killed a Japanese man for nothing more than holding a camera. His name was Kenji Nagai and his blood ran into the gutters like all the rest. They said thirteen dead but a soldier who'd fled told different tales. Bodies stacked like cordwood. Thousands maybe. Who could say.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time itself. The Romans had done it. The Japanese too. Even now they sat in their towers and talked to preachers about god and money and power while the world burned below. Men who would be kings. Men who would be gods.\n\nIn China they'd gathered in the square. Students mostly. Carrying their ideas like torches. The government said hundreds died. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Brother against brother. And before that the Reich had come with their trains and their camps and their cold precision. Loading families into cattle cars. Sorting the living from the soon to be dead. Writing numbers on skin like they were counting livestock. Loading them into ovens like so much cordwood.\n\nAll of it written in blood. All of it carried on the wind like ash. The girl stood on the corner holding her sign and watched the cars pass and perhaps she knew what we all knew. That evil never dies. It just changes its name and waits.",
            "He sat there at that grand piano like some dark prophet of old, fingers hovering above the ivory keys worn smooth by time and the ceaseless pressing of notes into the night. Duke they called him and duke he was of that realm of sound and fury that men named jazz. His legacy wasnt in the playing though. No. It was in the way he shaped those sounds through the years, through the men who came and went like wraiths through his orchestra, each leaving behind some piece of their soul in the music.\n\nThe piano parts lay quiet in them compositions like some sleeping beast. But Lord how he wrote. Wrote like a man possessed of demons or angels nobody could say which. Created frameworks vast and terrible where them soloists could wander free as wild horses, yet all the while contained within the borders he'd drawn up with ink black as midnight. Each piece carried the mark of the men who played it, like fingerprints left in wet clay that hardened into something permanent and true.\n\nThat piece they called Creole Love Call showed what he could do with just a voice. Used it like it was another horn in the section, no words to weigh it down. Six parts it had, like chambers in some great mechanical heart. First the voice crying out smooth as silk then turning rough as sin, them reeds answering back like lost souls. Then that muted trumpet speaking blue notes into the darkness. High clarinet soaring above it all while the piano whispered underneath. The full band rising up like a storm in the fourth part, brass and reeds calling back and forth across some great divide. Fifth part building like the apocalypse itself with them reeds screaming high and the rest of the band marking time like a congregation waiting for judgment. Last part bringing it all back home, voice growling like some beast of the night, before that trombone ended it all with a sound like the gates of hell swinging shut.\n\nHot and Bothered came next year, Bubber Miley's trumpet crying out and Baby Cox's voice answering like they was speaking some language lost to man since babel fell. Then It Don't Mean a Thing where Tricky Sam Nanton made that trombone moan like a soul in torment introducing the melody that would echo through the years like a ghost that cant find rest. This was the sound of America speaking in tongues nobody knew they had till Duke gave them voice.",
            "They come to us like ghosts from the deep time, these shells. Spiraling through darkness and void, through the countless millennia that shaped them. Each one carrying the marks of its making like some ancient testament writ in calcium and time.\n\nHe studied the shell in his hand. The whorls turning inward toward some mathematical truth that no man could name. Each revolution tracking its own trajectory through space, through time. The columella standing like some calcified spine down which all measurements must pass. He thought about the creature that had made it. Gone now to dust or deep water or both. Its life recorded only in these spiral equations that stretched back beyond memory, beyond knowing.\n\nThe last whorl stood largest of all, like the final word in some stone sermon. Above it the spire rose in diminishing circles toward heaven, toward that first point of beginning that men called apex. At the other end lay the base and between them the aperture gaped like a mouth trying to speak of its own creation.\n\nThey'd taken to counting the whorls in their own fashion. Viewing the shell from above like God might view the world, marking where that first suture began its journey outward. Drawing lines across the face of it like surveyors of some microscopic geography. Counting by quarters the revolutions it made. Each shell a map of its own making.\n\nHe thought about how the creature built its home. How each new chamber followed the last in an endless progression, each aperture plotting its course through space like some blind navigator reading coordinates in the dark. The mathematics of it all lay there in plain sight for those who knew how to read such things. Numbers that could be changed, adjusted. Like playing God with calculus and time.\n\nThese were the things they studied now. These ghost-maps of ancient life. These spiral testimonies to evolution's patient hand. Each shell a question asked across the ages. Each measurement an answer in the stone.",
            "He studied the numbers laid bare before him like bones in the sand. Ten years gone and the dying of infants in Indonesia remained unchanged, a constant thrum of loss against the fabric of time. The country moved forward in some ways, yes. Water flowed cleaner. Waste managed better. But the children and their mothers. Their blood ran just as freely as before.\n\nIn the cities where the skilled workers dwelt some seven of ten births saw hands that knew their craft. But these hands, some belonged to the old ways. To midwives who could watch but not save when the blood came. And it came often. Dark and merciless. The numbers lied in their way, spoke half-truths that echoed in empty rooms where children lay wracked with fever and loose bowels, their mothers nowhere to be found.\n\nThe cutting of wombs to bring forth life stood at four in hundred. In the cities it was seven. In the far places where the roads turned to dust and memory it was two. The division lay stark as a knife's edge between those with means and those without. Seven and twenty percent stretched between the richest and the poorest like a canyon that could not be crossed. Money was the bridge and many had none.\n\nThe question lay before them like a dead thing in the road. Whether to strike at each wound separately or to heal the whole of the body at once. The targeted approach beckoned like a flame in darkness, promising quick victory, measurable success. But such flames cast shadows too. When money flowed to one wound the others festered. Workers followed the coin like crows to carrion, leaving behind what they knew for what would feed them. Programs multiplied like weeds after rain, choking each other with papers and forms and requests that piled like ash in empty rooms.\n\nHe looked out across the statistics and data spread before him like auguries. The numbers were just numbers but behind them lay the truth. The dying continued. The blood flowed. And somewhere in a distant village a mother clutched her child and prayed to whatever god would listen.",
            "The sound had grown darker over them hundred years past, birthing genres upon genres till a man could scarcely count them all. Like some great beast splitting and dividing, each piece growing new limbs and new heads - rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, names that meant less with each passing season as they too split and divided and grew strange in the darkness.\n\nMetal rose from this darkness like something ancient and terrible. Forty years it had been now, maybe more. Time was a thing that slipped away in the shadows. It came bearing emotions raw and bleeding, things that normal folk didn't speak of in the light. Dark things. True things. It spread like wildfire in drought, each spark catching and growing into its own inferno until the original flame was lost in the conflagration.\n\nThey called it heavy metal but that name meant nothing now. It had consumed too much, grown too vast. Like some great leviathan it had swallowed whole the sounds that came before it, digesting them in its burning belly until they emerged transformed. To understand this beast you had to know its heart, had to know why it wasn't just music but something more, something that moved through the world like a shadow.\n\nIt was a thing of excess, of more. More sound, more fury, more violence than what came before. The players weren't simple folk beating at strings but masters of their craft, though that craft was dark indeed. In the seventies they fed it drugs and watched it grow stranger still, using the chemicals to birth sounds that hadn't existed before, couldn't exist in the natural world. They made records that came from places beyond, used the drugs as excuses for the terrible beauty they'd created. It spoke to something in the blood that other music couldn't touch, wouldn't touch. The old composers knew it, those romantic souls who wrote their symphonies in minor keys. The darkness was always there, waiting.\n\nWhen the Beatles wrote Helter Skelter they opened a door they couldn't close. It was a challenge to the Stones but it became something else, something first. The darkness had found its way in and there was no going back.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their strange visions there was Rousseau who worked in silence and in solitude crafting dreams of his own. The Dream they called it, this painting he made in 1910, and it showed a woman laid bare in wonderment at what stretched before her in sleep, though perhaps it was Rousseau's own dreams that haunted the canvas more than hers. Recognition he sought. Acceptance. The kind that comes with the nodding of heads in gilded halls where men speak in whispers about art and truth. But there was a war in him, silent and terrible. A choice between walking the path others had worn smooth or cutting his own way through the dark woods of creation.\n\nBefore you can know The Dream you got to know the man who dreamed it. Born he was in Laval in the northwest of France where his father worked metal and sold hardware and lived well enough. No schooling in art did young Henri receive but instead worked forty years collecting tolls for the government, though some took to calling him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go to their graves and left him with just Julia, their daughter, and a grief that sat in him like stone. He took up the brush then seeking something like salvation in paint and canvas.\n\nUnlike them that painted peasants with romantic notions Rousseau painted what he knew and dreamed what common folk dream. He worked in the shadow of giants, starting late with no learning while others like Matisse had already staked their claims in the art world. Gordon who wrote about such things said Matisse feared painting like others while Rousseau yearned for it, wanted nothing more than to make something so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him at last.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like brothers in blood. Reckoned there was something to that. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on that ancient urn, said beauty was truth and truth beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and beauty, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nWe dont make the rules for what's right or what's beautiful, he thought. We just try to understand them after they already been made. Like trying to describe why a thing is good or why it aint. Take that painting of the woman with the strange smile. Men could talk about light and shadow and what it meant in its time but that wasnt it. That wasnt it at all.\n\nWhen folks speak of things they love they always start the same way. There's just something about it, they say, before they try to explain with bigger words. But you cant never really explain it all. That woman O'Connor knew it. Said some things can only be told in stories cause regular words aint enough. Even when you describe every blessed thing about a book there's still something else. Something that aint got no words. Morality's the same way. Like that feller Wittgenstein said, you cant speak it proper. It's beyond speaking.\n\nHe thought on how both these things, what's right and what's beautiful, they hit a man someplace deep. Someplace you cant point to. Someplace beyond knowing but not beyond feeling. And when it comes to books, well. McKean had it right. Books aint like music or painting. Books carry the weight of right and wrong same as life does. Cant escape values when you're living and cant escape them in stories neither. That's why they matter. That's why they always will.",
            "The land stretched vast and cold beneath a colorless sky, from the shadow-wreathed peaks of München to the slate waters of Kiel where the Baltic lapped at ancient shores. This was Germany. The same blood coursed through the veins of those who dwelt by the Rhine at Köln as those who walked the stone streets of Dresden where the Elbe cut its path. A people carved from many, yet bound as one.\n\nGermania they called it in the old tongue. The name itself lost to time like footprints in shifting sand, though men argued still over its meaning. Tacitus, that Roman who put words to parchment, spoke of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine, becoming Germans in the telling. And Caesar before him, who first scratched Germanus into his accounts of war, took it from the Gauls he'd broken. Some said it meant neighbor in that dead language. Some said it came from the spears they carried, dark wooden ger that drank deep of blood. Or maybe it rose from their battle cries that echoed across the forests like the howls of wolves.\n\nTacitus wrote of them in his time, ink flowing black as pitch across the page. Aboriginal, he named them. Untouched. Pure as winter snow. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild woods and bitter skies? What man would choose such darkness unless born to it?\n\nThe Romans came though. Not to stay but to take. They sent their legions forth into those shadowed lands for amber and iron and flesh for their armies. They came and went like ravens to carrion, while the tribes remained. The Germans dwelt there in the borderlands, trading what the earth gave up to them, selling their sons to march beneath Roman eagles. They endured. They waited. The land was theirs and would remain so when Rome was dust.",
            "The play spoke of masks and lies and the dark truth that a man who wears another's face too long might forget his own. He might wake one morning and find himself gone entirely. Yet to cast off such deceits meant to stand naked before those you'd fooled and some would forgive while others would curse your name into the cold night air till the stars fell.\n\nWhen they changed their skin to wear another's gender it was a deeper thing. A more troubling thing. Like Viola who shed her woman's garments like a snake its skin, seeking shelter in manhood's guise. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she said, her words falling like dead leaves. \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\"\n\nShe walked the razor's edge between worlds, cut off from sisterhood, adrift in a foreign land. And Olivia, God help her, saw only what her eyes told her was true. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words hung in the air like smoke. Even Orsino felt the pull of something he couldn't name: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nThere was something raw and primitive in how the deception peeled back layers of desire like old wallpaper, revealing what lay beneath. Olivia's heart beat for Cesario but was it the man she thought she saw or something deeper, something that lived in darker waters? When Sebastian appeared like some twin star in the night sky, she turned to him as if Cesario had been nothing more than a dream. \"A sister, you are she,\" she said to Viola, and just like that the spell was broken, the disguise fell away like ash in the wind.\n\nThey all stood revealed in the harsh light of truth, each carrying their own deceptions like old wounds that wouldn't heal. The play showed us this mirror and asked us to look deep, to see what masks we wore, what lies we told ourselves in the dead of night when no one was watching.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the way they killed. The Ovaherero and the Nama knew. They knew in their bones and in their blood and in the dust that covered everything. The dust that was maybe their own people ground to powder by German boots and German guns.\n\nHe studied the old papers. Yellowed things speaking of schools and learning but the words were like smoke, there and gone and meaning nothing at all. In the east where the sun rose there were African men who could read and write and cipher numbers but in the southwest there was mostly just death and missionaries wandering like lost prophets in the desert vastness. The government built schools for the white children. Fine buildings of stone and wood but for the black children there was nothing. Nothing but dust and wind and the endless sky that didnt care what color a man was.\n\nThe land itself was a kind of school. Teaching things that no book could tell. How to die slow in the desert heat. How to watch your children waste away while white men sat in wooden houses drinking coffee and reading newspapers from Berlin. Fifteen thousand of them by 1913. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their stolen empire.\n\nHe thought about the numbers. Numbers that meant nothing and everything all at once. Five thousand whites in East Africa where the ground was rich and green. Fifteen thousand in the southwest where nothing grew but hate. The missionaries came with their bibles and their promises but their words fell dead in the dust like everything else.\n\nHe'd seen papers written about it all. German papers mostly, old things that smelled of mold and forgetting. Later there were English words too, trying to make sense of it all. But there wasnt no sense to be made. Just the story of men who thought they could own the world and other men who learned different. The hard way. The dead way.\n\nCohen wrote about it. Wrote about the schools and the settlers and why things were different here than there. But maybe it was simpler than all that. Maybe it was just that some places collect darkness like others collect rain. And South West Africa had collected more than its share.",
            "They came across the border like specters in the night, these two nations locked in their dance of death. Fifty-seven years they fought and bled, from 1836 when the first shots rang out across Texas until 1893 when the last echoes died away in the desert air. The war of '46 marked their darkest hour, American boots marching south through Mexican dust, claiming land that stretched far as any man could see. Texas and the Southwest territories fell like ripe fruit into American hands, though the blood price was dear.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a mineshaft. Different gods, different tongues, different ways. Each side carrying old wounds from Spanish and English fathers long dead, wounds that wouldn't heal. Like neighbors everywhere who share a fence and precious little else, they found reasons enough to kill.\n\nSouth of the border lay Catholic crosses and old monarchies, while north stood Protestant churches and democracy, though neither side could claim clean hands. The division between them was like the border itself - stark and unforgiving as the desert sun. Not unlike that later war between America and the Soviets, where men killed each other over ideas written in books they'd never read.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those fifty-seven years, though the real number was higher if you counted every raid and counter-raid along that ragged wound they called a border. Bandits and outlaws moved like coyotes between the two lands, striking at towns on both sides until finally both nations sent their armies to restore what passes for peace in such places.\n\nThe old rivalry died slow, like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American coin, and American eyes turned from taking land to taking profit. The guns fell silent but the memory remained, carried in the wind that blows eternal across that stark dividing line, whispering of old hatreds and older blood. Some say you can still hear it, if you listen close enough on a quiet night.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for security that childhood never gave. They'd say you'll always find work cause folks'll always get sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying instead.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone with nothing much saved and work became a memory. Still am broke down these days. Fifteen years living off government handouts leaves a person with nothing to call their own. Each dawn brings its own battle against fear and shame and uncertainty. Nothing stays fixed no more but one truth remains standing like a dead tree in a burned field - I wouldn't have made it without my people, my blood kin and the few true friends. When the darkness comes it strips away what strength you thought you had.\n\nTruth is there'll always be calamity waiting. Big or small don't matter none. No amount of preparing can shield you when the real storms hit. Too big to weather alone.\n\nPeople talk about getting free of government's rotting grip and I reckon they're right enough. But better we learn to trust each other again than go digging holes in our yards like scared animals. Better we learn to ask for help and give it too.\n\nThey preach about rugged individuals building this land but that ain't the truth of it. What kept our ancestors breathing through the hard times was mercy and respect and sharing what little they had. Them pioneers crossing the mountains didn't make it alone.\n\nSo make ready if you want. I done it myself. Got my survival kit with bandages and water tablets and plastic for the windows if the air goes bad. Got lights and batteries and matches sealed against water and food in tins. If you got land to farm and knowledge to keep food through winter then do it. Good idea same as having a wood stove, less you're stacked in apartments like cordwood.\n\nBut while you're fixing to survive, know your neighbors. Cause in the end that's all any of us really got.",
            "In the old world, in lands far east where the sun first rises, there lived a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. Not his true name. He walked out from his palace one night leaving all he knew behind him like a snake shedding its skin and when he came back he wasnt the same man that left. Maybe he wasnt a man at all anymore.\n\nThe things he spoke of grew like weeds in mens minds. Twenty five hundred years they grew. Changed and twisted. You could see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters now. Monks in their robes like old wraiths moving through the ceremony. The Buddha never spoke of such things but there they were all the same. The world changes what it touches. Even holy things. Even stone.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some meant harm and others didnt. Like wind wearing down a mountain. Like water cutting through rock. They all left their mark.\n\nWords have power. Internal. External. Hostile. Benign. These words were important. Internal meant those who followed the Buddha's way. External meant those who didnt. Hostile meant those who'd tear it all down. Benign meant those who didnt care either way but changed things all the same. The words would come again and again like a hammer striking an anvil.\n\nAt its heart the religion was simple things. Three jewels they called them. The Buddha himself. The Dhamma which was his word written down in three parts like a tree with three branches. The Sangha which was the people who followed. The writings spoke of deep things. No soul. Suffering that cant be escaped. Nothing lasts. These were the truths they found. Hard truths like iron. They said a man could break free of dying and being born again. Could shed desire like an old coat. Could let go of hate. Could see clear through delusion like looking through clean glass.\n\nThey had rules. Five for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Dont misuse the flesh. Dont poison the mind with drink. The monks had more. Many more. But at the bottom of it all were four truths. Life is suffering. Want causes suffering. Suffering can end. There is a way out."
