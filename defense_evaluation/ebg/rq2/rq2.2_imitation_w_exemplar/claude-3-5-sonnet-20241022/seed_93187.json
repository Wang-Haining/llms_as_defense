            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Then the cattlemen came with their herds and their axes, claiming squares of earth with paper and ink, turning the wild things to meat and timber. The ground remembered though. It remembered everything.\n\nTo farm such land right took more sweat than chemicals ever did. Weeds needed pulling, bugs needed picking, the soil itself needed feeding like a hungry child. But the old ways brought back the wild things. Birds returned. The ground grew rich again. A man could lose money doing it this way but there were programs, government men with clipboards who'd help if you let them tell you how to manage your own dirt.\n\nThey had a name for this piece of earth too. Called it the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, wrote it down in their conservation plans like giving it a name would keep it safe. But the land didn't know its name. It knew only the sun and the rain and the patient turning of seasons, the slow pulse of life that moved through it like blood through veins, ancient and unstoppable as God.",
            "Brothers carry a bond that runs deeper than blood and bone, deeper than memory itself. They know each other in ways no others can know them and see in each other's eyes the reflection of their own souls laid bare. In the darkest hours this bond shows its true nature whether that nature be merciful or cruel. These moments birth consequences that cannot be undone and leave marks that cannot be unseen. When brother looks upon brother he sees not what others might see but what truly dwells in the heart of both. Their actions speak louder than any words could and in those actions lie the truth of who they are.\n\nIn the story they call The Scarlet Ibis two brothers walked this path through the swamps and marshlands of their youth. The older brother carried within him a pride that burned like fire and the younger one named Doodle bore the weight of being less than what his brother had dreamed of. They moved through a world of cypress knees and spanish moss, through places where the mud was black as pitch and the water ran slow and dark. The older boy had wanted someone to race with through Old Woman Swamp, someone to climb the great pine behind the barn, someone to swim the dark waters to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle's heart was weak as wet paper and the doctors said he might not live at all.\n\nThe older brother's thoughts turned dark then. He would look at the infant lying there pale and small and think about pressing a pillow to that tiny face until the breathing stopped. But then one day the baby smiled at him and something in that smile reached down into whatever dark place such thoughts had come from and pulled them out by the roots. Even so the pride remained, burning away inside him like a coal that would not die. That pride would lead them both down paths that could not be unmade and into a darkness from which only one would return.",
            "The brain. He'd seen it once, gray and wet and pulsing beneath the broken shell of a man's skull. Like some ancient machine built by forgotten hands. No computer this. No mere collection of wires and circuits but something more terrible in its complexity. Something godlike.\n\nHe thought about how it worked. How it took the world and made it real. Light and sound and touch coming in through the senses like thieves in the night, transformed into electricity and chemicals that coursed through neural pathways like rivers through a darkened landscape. Bottom-up they called it. Top-down. Words that meant nothing and everything.\n\nThe attention filter was there too, deciding what was worthy and what wasnt. Like some cosmic doorman at the gates of consciousness. You could hear your name spoken soft in a crowded room but the individual blades of grass beneath your feet might as well not exist. Unless they did. Unless they had to.\n\nMemory was different. It came in pieces. Sensory memory that lasted mere seconds. Working memory that held on longer, electricity moving through loops of neurons like cars on an endless track. Then there was the long-term. Proteins twisted into shapes that held the past like fossils in stone. Sometimes they broke down. Sometimes they didnt.\n\nThe scientists had their models. Their networks of nodes and connections. Chair connected to table connected to wooden connected to nothing and everything all at once. But he knew better. The brain wasnt just connections and pathways. It was more than that. It was the sum of all things. The repository of all that was and all that would be.\n\nHe thought about the man's brain again. How it had looked there in the dim light. How it had ceased its endless calculations and gone still. How it had taken with it everything that man had ever known or loved or feared. Everything that man had ever been. In the end it was just meat. Just protein and fat gone cold in the night. But it had been something else once. Something more. Something terrible and beautiful and impossible to fully comprehend.",
            "The money was gone. All of it. Like water through sand in some forsaken desert where no man walked and no bird flew. Two thousand and seven it was when the great wheels of commerce ground to their halt and the nation stood idle and mute before what was to come. Men without work and homes standing empty and the corporations that had stood like granite mountains laid low and broken in the dust.\n\nThey'd ask later how such things could be. How the world could turn so swift and terrible upon itself like some rabid beast. The answer lay in the hearts of men who wore fine suits and sat in tall buildings. Men who knew nothing of consequence or suffering. Who dealt in paper promises that held no weight. Who took the dreams of common folk and turned them into poison.\n\nIn the time before, during Clinton's reign, the seeds were planted. Like a cancer growing quiet and malevolent. The banks were told to give money to them that couldn't pay it back. Steven Holmes wrote the truth of it in the Times though none would heed his words. Fannie Mae, he said. Government men pushing them to lend to the poor while shareholders howled for blood in the form of profit. Holmes saw what was coming like a prophet in the wilderness. Saw the government would have to save them all just like they done before with the savings and loans. But no one listened. No one ever does.\n\nThey made new kinds of debt. Strange mutations of the old ways. Adjustable-rates and mortgage-backed papers and collateralized obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The whole nation betting on houses like drunk men at a crooked card table. When it fell it fell hard. The five great banks of investment holding four point one trillion in bad paper. Thirty percent of everything the nation made or did or had. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies. Lehman Brothers torn apart like a carcass in the desert. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley brought to heel under government chains. Fannie and Freddie five trillion in debt and the government taking them over like some kind of failed state.\n\nThe nation watched it all happen like a man watching his house burn. Helpless. Mute. Knowing things would never be the same again.",

Just dry facts scattered like ash across paper, meaningless as the wind that howls through empty doorways of abandoned homes.\n\nWriter sits at her desk and knows. Knows deep in that place where knowing lives that the telling aint the showing and never was. Never could be. The stories that matter they dont come in lists of facts and figures. They come in blood and breath and heartbeat.\n\nShe remembers a man once. Air Force man working nights at a filling station out on Highway 9. Man with two wedding rings in a drawer somewhere and no young ones to speak of. Spent his Sundays with a pole in his hand watching the river flow past like time itself. Had dreams bigger than that station but smaller than the sky he used to fly in. Ate his eggs fancy style that morning like every morning, yolk running yellow as old memories.\n\nBut that aint the way to tell it. Story needs meat on its bones. Needs sinew and muscle to move it forward. Characters got to breathe and bleed and die right there on the page or they aint worth the ink that made them. Dialog has to cut like a knife or heal like a mother's touch. Every word's got to earn its place.\n\nExposition is the devil's own voice whispering sweet lies. Telling you to get it all out quick and dirty. Skip the heart of it. Skip the soul. But there aint no story without soul. Never was. Never will be. \n\nTruth is you got to let them live. Let them speak. Let them move through the world you made them leaving tracks deep enough to follow. Got to give them time to show who they are. What they want. What they fear in the dark of night when sleep wont come.\n\nAnything less is just bones in the desert. Just dust in the wind.",
            "He watched the screen flicker in the dark of morning, the news from Columbus casting shadows on the wall. First came word of Ashley, where a man named Hostettler had taken blade to wife. His mugshot stared back through the glass, eyes black as pitch, soul darker still. They gave it two minutes and moved on like wind through dead grass.\n\nThen came the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone from this world now by bullet in Sharon Woods. No killer found, though SWAT moved through the streets like wraiths. The story passed quick as summer rain, and he knew why. He'd seen it before, how the box treated dark flesh different from light, how some victims got remembered and others forgotten like dust in the wind.\n\nThe Med-Flight story came next. Small caliber round through metal skin, .22 they said. Somewhere out there in the vast dark a rifleman waited, five thousand dollars now the price of his name.\n\nWeather rolled through like thunder itself. Rain coming, they said. Heat holding in the eighties like fever in a dying man. Quick as it came it went, bait to keep eyes fixed to the screen.\n\nThen the UDF robbery on Clime Road. They lingered on the darkness of the man's skin like oil on water, six foot frame in a hooded shroud. One fifty on the scale. The words felt heavy with something unspoken, something that crawled beneath like insects under bark.\n\nLast came the kingpin Rodriguez, Texas man moving green weight north like migration. Three hundred months they gave him instead of twenty-five years, numbers dancing strange in the telling. Hispanic, they said, though it mattered none to the time he'd serve in concrete and steel.\n\nThe news ended like all things must, leaving him alone with thoughts of how stories get told, how some words carry weight while others drift away like ash in the wind, forgotten before they hit ground.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing born of man's endless want to possess and control what could not be controlled. To track and measure and quantify the measureless march of commerce across the waste of time.\n\nThe boy looked at him. What is it Papa?\n\nIts a way men tried to own pieces of the world without touching them. Like catching shadows in a box.\n\nThe numbers stretched across the page in their rigid formations. Each column a testament to man's futile attempt to impose order on chaos. The top holdings stood like sentinels. Ten of them. Accounting for 63.58 percent of all that was contained within. He ran his finger down the figures. Beta. Return. Standard deviation. Words that meant everything and nothing in the world that was.\n\nThey found that the return was higher in the ten than in the whole. 6.11 percent higher. A ghost of prosperity in a dead economy. The beta lower by point twelve. Numbers dancing their cold dance across the page like dead leaves in a winter wind.\n\nHe remembered the trading floors. The screens glowing blue in the darkness. Men in their dark suits watching the numbers rise and fall like the tide. All of it gone now. Ashes and dust.\n\nTo determine if the difference meant anything they would need to calculate the standard deviation. Another ritual. Another genuflection before the altar of statistical significance. The boy watched him work the figures.\n\nWhy do we need to know Papa?\n\nBecause knowing is all we have left.\n\nBut the numbers told no truth that could be trusted. They were ciphers in a dead language. Hieroglyphs on the wall of a tomb. The mathematics of a world that no longer existed.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and there it was plain as death. The numbers fell off a cliff that third month, like something had died in them. Winter had come to New England like it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that swept them clean. December it was, or what passed for December in these parts. The campus grew quiet. Students and teachers alike buried in their tasks like creatures before the storm. The commuter logs lay forgotten in desk drawers and computer screens, testimony to good intentions gone astray.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying. Halls echoed vacant and parking lots stretched bare under the cold sky. When they returned in January the numbers stayed low, as if something had broken that couldn't be fixed. February brought no relief. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, he thought. The fire burns bright at first then gutters out like a candle in wind.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March. A desperate measure maybe but it worked after its fashion, breathing some life back into the dying thing. But they couldn't escape the truth of it - the academic calendar was a kind of death to momentum, cutting the legs out from under any forward motion they might build.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. Cars were freedom. Independence. The open road stretching endless to the horizon. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't change what lay in his heart. They tried with their gifts - certificates for food and drink and comfort, for books and necessities. But it wasn't enough. He thought about bigger prizes - bicycles gleaming new under fluorescent lights, hybrid cars humming quiet as ghosts, electric vehicles that ran clean as winter air. If they'd done that, if they'd dangled those greater rewards like stars just out of reach, maybe the numbers wouldn't have fallen so far. Maybe the logs would have kept coming in through those dark winter months, testament to human persistence in the face of easier paths. But they hadn't done that. They'd kept to their modest offerings and watched the numbers fall like leaves in autumn, scattered by winds they couldn't control.",
            "I sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them old Edison films one by one. Fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared on the wall like spirits conjured up from some ancient projector grinding in the dark.\n\nThe films was mostly bound to stages like theater shows. Everything frontal and far off like you was watching through a window into another world. No movement of the camera. No getting close to the faces. Just figures moving side to side in their fixed space like marionettes on invisible strings. That's how it was back then. That's how they learned it from the vaudeville shows and magic acts that came before.\n\nIn Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel the figures moved like ghosts across the frame. Right to left. Left to right. Never coming closer never moving away. The camera watched unmoved like some dead-eyed god. That's how they all was. Every one of them trick films bound by rules older than the pictures themselves.\n\nThey shot everything from far off or middle distance. Never close. Never intimate. Like watching life through the wrong end of a telescope. The audience got what the stage gave them and nothing more. No faces. No details. Just the whole scene laid out before them like some moving tableau.\n\nMost of them films was just one shot. One minute or less of magic. Of vanishing. Of things appearing and disappearing like fever dreams. But they wasn't really one shot at all. They was pieces stitched together to fool the eye. Like that film of Mary Queen of Scots. If you looked close enough you could see where they'd cut it. Where they'd sewn the pieces together to make her head come off. But folks didn't look close back then. They just watched and believed in the magic of it all.\n\nThe films was like windows into another time. A time when pictures moved for the first time and people gathered in the dark to watch shadows dance on walls. When magic was still possible and tricks could still fool the eye. When the world was younger and simpler and full of wonder.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what them scholars say. Like some ancient thing dredged up from the black waters of time and set to dry in the modern sun. Some called it empty, others praised its terrible beauty like a storm rolling across the plains at night. When Walpole wrote that first one, The Castle of Otranto, he took what was dead and breathed life into it, made something that weren't quite alive nor dead but walked the earth nonetheless.\n\nHe built it from old timber and new nails, using them theatrical ways of the past mixed with what folk called the natural telling of things. Like some mad carpenter fashioning a house from bones of different beasts. Gothic it was called, though that word had been passed round so much it had worn smooth of meaning, like an old coin rubbed blank between too many fingers. Folk looked down on it, called it primitive against their fine modern sensibilities. But that marriage of old theatre-ways and the new intimate telling, that's what gave it power. Power that lingered like smoke in still air, making it both dead and alive to them that read it years later, centuries later.\n\nChivalry stood at the heart of it all, like some old oak in a dead forest. That medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got twisted and changed in Walpole's hands but never quite lost its shape. These Gothic writers, they saw something missing in their time, some honor or bravery that had leaked out of the world like water from a cracked jug. They looked back at them knights of old with longing, making heroes of shadows. Walpole himself was neck-deep in the political muck of his day, watching good men turn bad and true things turn false. Maybe he thought something pure had been lost, something that them knights of old had carried in their iron hearts.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic, painting him with all them old colors of chivalry. A prince who'd known suffering, marked by tragedy, thought to have fallen to the blades of infidels. He made him larger than life, like some statue carved too big for human proportion, excess piled on excess till it near toppled over with the weight of its own telling.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to the hands of them that would possess its yield. Oliver he was called, the man who gave it name back in eightytwo. A consultant. He reckoned it needed planning and watching and steering like some great beast that might otherwise run wild and wreck all in its path.\n\nSix parts it had, like the chambers of some industrial heart. Production and supply and inventory and location and the moving of things and the knowing of things. These the overseers used to feed the hunger of them that would buy.\n\nProduction stood first among them, like some dark foundation stone. It asked its questions. When. Why. Where. How. The overseers they had to know what the people wanted and they watched the marketplace like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what numbers to set down in their ledgers. Which things to make and how many and where to make them. They chose their grounds careful, like a man picking a place to make his stand.\n\nI worked once in them great stores, Walmart and Target both. Everything laid out just so, like a ritual. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take in the goods when they came. Everything written down in books like scripture.\n\nThe supply was the second thing. Strategic they called it. Core capabilities. Words that meant nothing and everything. Sometimes they'd split the work between different places, different hands. Sometimes theyd send it out beyond their walls to other makers, other shops. Velocity they called it. The hunger for speed and quality both, and the getting of it cheap. The eternal struggle between what things cost and what they're worth.\n\nEach overseer watching his own piece of the great mechanism, all of them connected like the bones in a spine. If one failed the whole thing could come apart. The shelves would empty. The people would hunger. And in the end it was all about the hunger, wasnt it? The endless hunger of a world that could never be filled.",
            "Dark and godless they were, them Victorian tales. All gilt and finery draped over the bones of the aristocracy like clothes on a hanged man. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Stories that carried mystery in their bowels like some biblical beast, strange and terrible tales that gave flesh to their characters in ways no parlor story ever could.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams. Walked with killers in his sleep while his mind burned with fever and pain. Sikes and Crackit moving through the dark like specters, their words hanging in the air like smoke. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights swimming in the dark. Pain everywhere and nowhere. Some hand he couldn't see dragging him through the void.\n\nTime itself bent and broke in these stories. Day becoming night becoming day, all of it meaningless. The boy had no control over any of it, no more than a leaf has control over the wind that carries it. The old jew Fagin had worked his devil's magic well, breaking the boy's spirit like you'd break a wild horse. Even with death reaching for him with both hands the boy couldn't fight. Wouldn't fight. Just let the darkness take him like it was his due.\n\nIn these moments the truth showed its face. Not in the fancy drawing rooms or behind lace curtains but in the fever dreams of a dying boy. In the spaces between heartbeats when the world goes quiet and a soul can hear its own echo.",
            "Two years past I worked with the young ones after their schooling had ended for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. English mostly and some reading. One of them teachers come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, couldn't say which now. Said he couldn't read right. Watched him struggle with the letters like they was foreign things. Some he knew true as sunrise but others may as well have been marks in the dust. Brown skin that boy had and spoke English clean as any of them but something wasnt right.\n\nDays went by. We worked at it. Then come a day when his mother appeared in that tired classroom while the others was gone on some venture. She stood there and no English passed her lips. Only Spanish words I barely understood with what little I knew of that tongue. Standing there I saw it clear as bones in the desert. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters proper. Whether that knowing helped him none I cant say.\n\nI tell this tale cause of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the words we give them. Even them that speak it good as anyone. Adrian he just needed teaching in our letters and sounds but there's many who need more than that. Aint no simple answer neither. Two-language learning. Throwing them in with the rest. Special teachers. None of these alone will do it.\n\nWhat works is all of it together like a wall of stones. Each piece holding the other. Teaching two tongues aint just for them that speak Spanish first. Studies show it makes all of them sharper. Some folks fear it. Say it wastes what little we got. They're wrong as wrong can be. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues but we need some that do. Like guideposts in the dark. Showing the way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant wrap your mind around no matter how hard you try. Some folk take their children to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some to temples made of stone and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth they think might be there. Most just take what their mothers and fathers gave them like a hand me down coat. Others spit on the very notion that anything could be bigger than their own small world. A man might choose one way of believing then cast it off like snakeskin for another. Whatever path we take we're all searching for that thing that makes us whole. Looking for that light in the black that'll guide us home.\n\nMe and my father sat on the porch that day. Rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Both of us with cigarettes. The gutters running full and drowning out the flowers below. Cardinal, he said when I asked him what bird he liked best. He stared out into the rain like a man trying to remember something he'd lost. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's. His hair thin and patchy where it used to be thick. He wouldn't look at me and I couldn't speak of what was coming because speaking makes a thing real. I moved closer and hugged him and we both watched the rain fall in the failing light of that June evening.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and their machines bought him a few more months of suffering and I never could reckon the worth of that. What sort of God would do such a thing. I laid in the dark those nights. No prayers passed my lips. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI wouldn't watch him die. Couldn't. You cant watch the life that made you while it leaves this world. I wanted to keep him how he lived not how he died. I knew him better than any of them did. Better than his own kin. And I knew he wouldn't want his only child watching while death took him. So I curled up in my bed and waited three days for word.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "The man called Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his land and knew the worth of soil and seed and sovereignty. In those early days of the Republic he stood testament to the old ways, though he was no stranger to the halls of power where men spoke of governance and law. But it was the earth that shaped him and gave weight to his words about freedom and the rights of men to work their own ground.\n\nHe saw in this new country something that had never been before. A land unbound by the old ghosts of tradition. A place where men might govern themselves if they had the courage for it. He knew that rights were like bones in the body of liberty. Break one and the whole corpus fails. These things must remain beyond the reach of any government lest all be lost.\n\nThe world of nature he knew was red of tooth and claw where the strong preyed upon the weak but civilization could not abide such ways. He saw that government must account for the darkness in men's hearts while preserving what light remained. Good and evil moved through his thoughts like wind through winter wheat. As government is exercised by man all its virtues and vices must be human, he wrote, knowing the truth of it in his bones.\n\nHe believed good principles were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that improved the tilling of soil, that stood against the moneyed interests who would make all men slaves to coin and paper. Self-interest drove all things but turned poisonous when it led men to feed upon their brothers.\n\nLike others who stood for the old Republic he held to the Constitution's words with iron certainty. The federal power must be bound and limited lest it grow fat and tyrannous on the people's bread. Yet he knew too that words alone were dangerous things without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true charter, for it spoke of sovereign states and not one nation bound in chains of power. He saw these truths as clear as he saw the furrows in his fields, and spoke them with the same certainty that seeds would sprout in spring.",
            "He stood there watching. The porcelain bowl white and cold beneath the fluorescent lights that hummed like distant wasps. His mind moved through the scene like water over stone, taking nothing with it, leaving nothing behind. Just the watching.\n\nHe remembered a book. Some woman had told him about it once, an artist woman who spoke of the right side of the brain and how to see what was real in the world. How to frame it. How to make it small enough to understand. But there wasnt any frame for this. No way to make it smaller or more comprehensible. It was what it was.\n\nThe brown mass lay there in the bottom of the bowl like some primitive creature pulled up from the depths of the earth. Like something that had no business in the world of men. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was his color now. Brown. The color of endings. The color of what gets left behind.\n\nHis hand found the lever and pulled. Water swirled and moved like spirits in the bowl but the thing remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again and watched the water rise and fall. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The green tie at his throat felt like a noose.\n\nHe stood with his feet set wide on the tiles. The mop beside him like some useless weapon. The paper rolled off the roll like bandages for some wound that wouldnt heal. Layer after layer wrapped around his hand until it was something else entirely. Not a hand anymore but a tool. A thing for doing what needed doing.\n\nWhen he reached into the bowl his arm moved slow and careful like a man reaching into the mouth of something that might wake up and bite. The water was cold. Everything was cold. The world was cold and this was what was left of it. This was what they paid him for. This was what men did.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers and charts but the dead care nothing for such things. The National Institute speaks of brains not ready, not formed, like wet clay not yet hardened in the kiln of years. But there is more to it than that. More darkness in the hearts of the young.\n\nHe watched them on the roads. Inexperienced. Raw. Their vehicles rolling and tumbling like dead leaves in an autumn wind. Speed demons chasing something they could not name. The asphalt calling to them like some dark siren song.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves. Studies done in the southern lands of California showed the truth of it. The more of them together, the more bones scattered on the roadside. States tried to cage them with paper laws. Provisional licenses. Time restrictions. But laws are just words on paper and the young have always held such things in contempt.\n\nThe psychologist Zuckerman knew. Even at eighteen the blood runs hot and wild. They seek the thrill like addicts seeking the needle. The rush of speed and danger coursing through their veins like some precious poison. He had seen it in their eyes. That hunger. That need.\n\nBy the year 2010 they would come in waves. The children of the boom times reaching driving age like some great migration. Millions of them. The roads would run red with their passing.\n\nThe solution lay in waiting. Let them learn in classrooms and simulators but keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them practice under watchful eyes. Six hours behind the wheel. Fifty hours with an adult present. Like an apprenticeship to survival.\n\nThe law would need to be universal. Coast to coast. Border to border. One rule for all the young. It was not a new idea. Others had spoken it before. But sometimes old medicine is the strongest medicine. Sometimes the old ways are the only ways.\n\nHe thought of all the young ones yet to die. Their faces unknown but their fates already written in the cold equations of probability. Perhaps there was still time to save them. Perhaps. But time was like water in a cracked vessel. Running out. Always running out.",
            "The boy watched him scrawl upon the yellowed paper with a worn pencil stub. Words about the broken ones, them that cant hear right in their heads. Not deaf mind you but somethin worse. Like their brains was wrapped in cotton. Like God himself had reached down and pulled some wires loose just to see what might happen.\n\nHe wrote about them that studied it first. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. Back in fifty-four when the world was younger and less cruel. They'd sit with children broken in ways you couldn't see and they'd make their tests and write their findings in thick leather books now turned to ash somewhere.\n\nThe afflicted ones they'd tested couldn't place sounds in the world like normal folk. Couldn't tell which way a voice came from or pick one voice from many. Like trying to catch fish in muddy water with your bare hands. Some couldn't hear the difference tween a question and a threat, couldn't make sense of the simplest things said to them. Their brains betrayed them. Simple as that.\n\nThey got doctors now that'll test for it. Audiologists they call em. White coats and clipboards and machines that measure the echoes in your head. They'll sit you down and whisper numbers in your ears and make you repeat em back. They'll ask you questions about what you hear and don't hear and write it all down in their precise hand like scribes recording the words of prophets. But there aint no one test that'll tell you for certain. No machine that can look inside and point to the broken part and say here, here's your trouble. The cause remains a mystery, like most terrible things in this world.\n\nHe set down the pencil and studied what he'd written. Words marching across the page like soldiers heading to war. Each one carrying its own weight of meaning. Each one a testament to the ways we break and the ways we try to mend what's broken.",

The social work it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night. Not then maybe but soon enough. The darkness in mens souls and the things they visit upon their children. I had seen it before. Would see it again.\n\nThe degree in psychology hanging on the wall like some talisman against the evil that men do. But it wasnt enough. Never was. The police they stood in the yard that day watching. Just watching. The parents in their hollow righteousness spouting words like manipulative and simple disputes but their eyes betrayed them. Evil has a look to it. You see it enough times you dont forget.\n\nI knew then what I had to become. A worker in the darkness. Someone to stand between the innocent and the void. The values burned in me like a flame. Service. Justice. Ethics. Words that mean nothing until they mean everything. Until they're all that stands between a child and the darkness that would swallow them whole.\n\nI had always been different. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Metal in my flesh like some tribal marking. A warrior for the different ones. The lost ones. The gay and the straight and all the spaces between. Fighting the old battles against hate and ignorance. These were my people. The ones society wanted to make invisible.\n\nThe social work it calls to you like a siren song. Like something ancient and true. You either hear it or you dont. And if you hear it you cant unhear it. It becomes the thing that drives you. The thing that wakes you in the night. Because out there in the darkness children are crying and someone has to answer. Someone has to stand in the doorway between innocence and evil and say no further. This far and no further.\n\nAnd that's what I aim to do. To stand in that doorway until they plant me in the ground. Because evil never sleeps and the innocent need their warriors. Their protectors. Their workers in the social dark.",
            "The dark shapes of sleep and wakefulness move through us like spirits in the night. They come unbidden and go as they please and we are powerless against their ministrations. In the laboratory they keep mice in small metal cages and study how sleep comes to them or doesnt. The scientists speak of things called neurons firing in the hypothalamus, orexin coursing through the brain like some biblical flood. They speak of receptors called GABAB as if naming old testament prophets. These receptors they say govern the coming of sleep and its going.\n\nThe mice they study are not unlike us in their need for rest. Their small hearts beating in the dark of their cages while the white-coated priests of science watch and make their marks in leather-bound books. They speak of something called baclofen that makes the mice sleep longer and deeper. As if sleep itself could be caught and measured and weighed like grain.\n\nThere are those among us who cannot sleep. Who lie awake in the vast darkness while the world turns beneath them. Their genes carry some ancient curse passed down through blood and bone from father to son and mother to daughter. The absence of proper receptors in their brains leaving them to wander the midnight hours like restless ghosts. \n\nThe scientists say their research with the mice can tell us about ourselves. About why some can sleep and others cannot. About how this failure of sleep moves through families like some dark inheritance. How it destroys lives as surely as any plague - taking first the ability to work, then to think, then finally the will to go on living in a world without rest.\n\nThey keep their mice in metal cages and study them and make their marks in books but the truth of sleep remains mysterious as death. The neurons fire or they dont. The receptors work or they fail. And in the end we are all at the mercy of forces we barely understand, forces as old as the darkness itself.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like water through a sieve. Dark mornings walking east from Stuart Hall where they'd put me that first year, far out on the edge of things where the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray sky. Twenty-five minutes by foot to Willard if the weather held. Weather rarely held. Some old timer told me bout how it was before. Said East Halls stood alone out there like some outpost, nothin but empty land between. Not anymore. Sports fields now. New buildings risen up like concrete monuments. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment blocks crowding round like mourners at a wake. Campus growing like some living thing, reaching out across the valley floor. Distance growing with it.\n\nBicycle's the answer. Simple as that. But answers aint worth nothing without action behind em. Need riders. Need paths. Need the whole damn thing built right.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said bikes was the only true way. Bowl of oatmeal'll take you thirty miles if you're willing. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best thing I ever done. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minutes walking. Five minutes riding if you pump hard enough. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it aint friendly. Like some river of humanity flowing both ways, everyone in their own world, everyone moving like the world's about to end.\n\nWalking's good for the soul maybe but time aint kind. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's precious out here. Time's all we got.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words again. Words about a world that never was but might yet be. The book lay heavy in his hands like some ancient tome speaking prophecies of darkness. Brave New World they called it. Weren't nothing brave about it though.\n\nThe world in them pages was a cold one. Clinical. Everything measured out in droppers and test tubes, life itself parsed and portioned like medicine. Community they called it but it weren't no community he'd ever known. Just people moving like machines, thinking thoughts put there by others. The Controller watching over it all like some dark god in his high tower.\n\nMarx had seen it coming maybe. That old prophet of the working man speaking through time about false consciousness and hegemony. Big words for simple truths. The truth that men could be made to love their chains if you gilded them proper. In that brave new world they'd done just that, made folk happy to be slaves. Deltas and Gammas and all manner of greek-lettered souls moving through their days like sleepwalkers, dreaming dreams fed to them in the dark while they slept.\n\nWeren't no real love in that world. No passion neither. Just bodies moving against bodies, mechanical-like. Men speaking of women like they was talking about the weather, clinical words about pneumatic this and pneumatic that. Women too, talking about their couplings like they was discussing what they had for breakfast. All of it hollow. Empty as a dead man's eyes.\n\nHe thought about them social classes, stacked up like cord wood. Each one content in their place cause they'd been told to be content. Consuming and obeying and never questioning why. The upper classes watching it all, knowing maybe but not caring. All of them caught in the same machine, just different gears turning different ways.\n\nThe whole thing speaking to something deeper. Something about how men lose their souls when machines and money become their gods. How technology and capitalism together could strip a man down to nothing but wants and needs, all manufactured proper-like by them that knew how. A warning maybe, written in ink but speaking in blood.\n\nHe closed the book. Outside the wind moved through dead trees, whispering secrets to no one at all.",
            "The class on Islam came to me four winters past at CBC, dark thoughts weighing on minds like storm clouds. They spoke of hostility in the faith, voices rising and falling like wind through dead grass. The question hangs heavier now than it did then, like a noose waiting for its neck.\n\nI watched how the papers and screens changed their telling after the towers fell. First came the rage, hot and blind as wildfire. Then something else. A kind of forced kindness, stretched thin as spiderweb. Strange days these are when a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. The words dont match the deeds, like footprints leading two ways. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise. I seen how he took the tribes, one after another, blade first then faith following. Yet here in these pages they paint him soft as lamplight, a martyr walking through sand and time, people following him like lost sheep finding water.\n\nThey wrote him performing works that mirror the Christ's own doing. Took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men till they could eat no more. These words feel hollow, like bones picked clean. They wanted him holy, needed him holy, but the truth is a different beast altogether. It's a theft of sacred things, taking Christ's glory and draping it over their own prophet like a borrowed cloak.\n\nThe stories come third-hand or worse, passed mouth to mouth like desert gossip. Someone heard from someone who heard from another, on and on till truth gets lost in the telling. They meant it for proof but it reads like smoke, nothing solid to grasp.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they made him gentle when gentleness wasnt in him. They wrote of wisdom and humility but the blood tells different. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true shape of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the stories, believing what they need to believe.",
            "The truth of the Christ and what he spoke in his time was lost quick as breath in winter, scattered to winds that carried new thoughts across the land after his passing. Like tracks in ash swept clean. Looking back across the years you could see how the teaching got further and further from where it started, like a man walking away from his home till he cant see it no more behind him. These days theres a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasnt there before. The old ones still cling to what their fathers told them but they grow fewer, like trees in a burned forest.\n\nThe Christians that remain will come to see what was lost. Theyll hunger for it like men dying of thirst. Theyll want to peel back the layers of words men put over the words of God like paint over paint until they find what was first written there. Maybe it'll take a hundred years. Maybe more. But it'll come sure as winter follows fall. They'll strip it down piece by piece, like taking apart an old house board by board till nothing stands but the foundation that Jesus himself laid down. When this thing sweeps through the old countries itll carry people with it like leaves in a river. The church will still stand but itll be different. Simpler. More like it was.\n\nWhere once there were a thousand different ways to worship therell be just one. Like streams joining to make a river. The differences between men will wash away like footprints in rain. History's got a way of turning back on itself, like a snake eating its own tail. Time was when Romans killed Christians in the streets but then Rome itself knelt down before the cross. This country once kept men in chains and now those same men's sons sit in high places. The wheel keeps turning.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading a map but like reading poetry. Looking for the truth behind the words instead of in them. To understand how we got here you got to go back. Back before there was any such thing as Christian. Back when there was only the old religion of the Jews. They believed in one God and holy books and divine revelation. But even then they were split five ways - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who followed none of these. Each claiming they knew the truth of things.",
            "They was greedy folk them owners and managers and they knew it deep in their guts but they didnt care none. The factories rose up like great black mountains against the sky and the smoke poured forth like rivers of death flowing to the ends of the earth. Aint no man ever looked down from them heights and saw anything worth saving below. The workers was just numbers to them. Numbers on paper written in ink black as their hearts.\n\nThe place they called Packingtown was a hellhole of suffering where men and women worked themselves to bone and marrow for scraps while the bosses grew fat on their misery. Loyalty was a word that held no meaning there. Everything had its price and a man's worth was measured in dollars and cents. The owners would sooner see a worker dead than spend a penny more than they had to. That was the truth of it plain and cold as winter.\n\nThe smoke rolled thick and black across the sky and the stench of death and rot hung in the air like a curse. Animal waste ran in rivers through the streets mixing with the blood and the filth. But them that owned the place they just watched from their offices high above counting their money while below the people suffered and died.\n\nWasnt no laws to protect them workers back then. No safety regulations nor nothing to keep the owners from working them till they dropped dead on the killing floors. The unions that come along they was just as bad. Vultures picking at the bones of them that was already half dead from the work. Most of them workers was foreigners desperate for any kind of work and the owners knew it. Used it against them like a whip.\n\nThey was slaves in all but name. Living on the edge of starvation day after day dependent on the mercy of men who had none to give. The morality of such a place was like everything else there corrupted and diseased. The whole system was rotten through and through like meat left too long in the sun. And there wasnt no escape from it neither. Not for them that was caught in its grip.",
            "The darkness lay over Dreamland like a shroud, black and ancient as time itself. In those pages Poe had writ the word Thulé, scratched it there twice as though marking the borders of some forsaken realm. The word itself carried echoes of Virgil's voice across the centuries, speaking of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the Greeks had drawn their maps to end in mist and legend.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten into Poe's blood like a fever. Their words moved through him like dark water through deep caves.\n\nThere was Goethe. His Faust stood like a monument, carved in two great pieces across the years - first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death finally took him. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed beyond the veil, leaving him nothing but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep from both until neither could sustain him. When the end came he gave away his kingdom like a man shrugging off a heavy coat, keeping only that cup, that last token of love. Then he walked out onto the cliffs above the sea, black water moving below. The goblet caught the light one final time before he cast it into the depths. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into darkness.\n\nThe shade of that tale fell across Poe's \"Dream-Land\" like an evening shadow. He wrote of Thule twice, bookending his verses with that ancient word as though to mark the borders of that desolate realm. His speaker wandered landscapes stripped of color, haunted by the ghosts of dead companions, moving through a world as empty as the one Goethe's king had left behind.\n\nThe connection ran deeper than chance. Poe knew Goethe's work - how could he not? It moved through the literary world like blood through veins. When they spoke of Tennyson, Poe would nod, knowing the threads that bound them all together across the dark waters of influence and time. The reproductions of Goethe's work spread like ripples in still water, touching everything. Even Grattan had shaped Faust anew in 1842, barely a year before Poe set down \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" with its own whispered mention of ultima Thule.",
            "They'd tell stories later about that day at D&D Markets. About the applesauce that lay there like some pale viscous blood upon the floor and how Martin sat in his office eating while fate worked its slow arithmetic in the aisles beyond. The spill had come at five. Wayne had seen it first. Told Martin who sat there behind his desk with his dinner laid out before him like some pagan offering to darker gods. Didn't have time for customer complaints he'd said. His voice flat and dead as winter.\n\nFifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came. She too bore witness to the creeping danger in aisle four but Martin would not be moved. He sat immobile as stone while time crept past like a thief in the night. Half past five Palmer came. She never saw what took her feet from under her. Never saw the applesauce gleaming dull and treacherous in the fluorescent light. Her back broke bad and she fell into darkness deeper than any night.\n\nThe law spoke of malice and oppression and fraud. Spoke of despicable acts committed with willful disregard. Six souls had fallen in those aisles that year alone. Six victims to negligence and indifference cold as the tile floor itself. The judges knew such things. Had seen them written in blood and broken bones across the years. Taylor's case spoke of dangerous consequences known but not heeded. Of willful failure to act when action might have saved.\n\nMartin knew. He knew and still he sat. Still he ate while danger waited patient as a rattler in the aisles. The law would not look kindly on such things. Would not shield him from the punishment such calculated indifference called forth. Palmer's claim would stand. The courts would hear her tale of woe and pain. Of a manager who chose his dinner over duty. Who let peril stalk his store while he supped in safety.\n\nThe law was clear as morning. Clear as the applesauce that lay there waiting. Punitive damages would come like judgment day. No summary dismissal would save them now. The facts lay bare as bones and twice as damning. They would pay in coin and conscience both.",
            "The wanting had come early. Like a shadow that follows but never catches up. Started when she was fourteen and lingered still at seventeen, a ghost of need that wouldnt rest. Not a thing she needed no. A someone. But the boys that came didnt matter none. They'd circle like crows round a dying thing, awkward in their courtship, but she felt nothing for them. Nothing at all. She'd lay awake studying the ceiling, questioning what darkness lived inside her that made her this way. Years passed like that. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet mostly. Her folks were peaceful folk who rarely raised their voices, save when their daughter's wild spirit crashed against their stillness like waves on stone. She was their opposite, full of life and light that drew others to her like moths to flame. Good hearted too. Kind.\n\nBut this day wasnt quiet. No. This day carried something else. She wandered room to room searching for something she couldn't name when her mother's scream cut through the silence like broken glass. Kitchen. She ran. Found her mother laid out on the tile floor, face twisted in pain, breath coming short and sharp.\n\nMama what's wrong? She knelt beside her mother who could barely speak through the hurt. Hospital, her mother managed. Just take me there.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms from all them classes she'd taken. Carried her to the car and laid her in the back like something precious and broken. Drove fast through streets gone colorless with worry.\n\nThe hospital reeked of death and cleaning fluid but she noticed none of it. Just carried her mother through them sliding doors calling for help until white-coated figures appeared like ghosts from the fluorescent haze. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left the girl alone with her fear.\n\nLater they told her. Her mother had been reaching for some old vase, balanced on a stepstool like a bird on a wire. Then gravity remembered her and brought her down hard to the unforgiving earth.",
            "They watched them dying year by year. Hearts giving out like old clockwork, blood vessels clogged and useless. The nurses knew. They'd seen it before and they'd see it again. Seventy four thousand of them watching and waiting and marking their charts with what they ate and what they didn't. Mediterranean style they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from ancient trees. No meat to speak of. Like them old desert people used to eat before the world went wrong.\n\nThe women they studied weren't sick yet. Not with the sugar disease nor the heart troubles. Thirty eight to sixty three years old they was. Every few years they'd write down what passed their lips. Everything catalogued like a church inventory. Two decades of eating and dying. Some quit the study but most stayed on. Faithful as converts to some old religion.\n\nThe doctors checked every death. Every seized-up heart, every blood vessel burst in the brain. They'd look at papers and records and death certificates like archaeological artifacts. Sometimes there weren't no records to speak of. They called them probable cases and counted them anyway. Seventeen percent of the strokes. Twenty four percent of the heart attacks that didn't kill.\n\nThey kept track of everything. Weight and smoking and pills they took. Whether their monthly blood still came or if it had stopped. Whether they moved their bodies or just sat still. Like bookkeepers tallying up the accounts of lives lived and lost.\n\nThey used numbers to wash away the noise. Averaged everything together like mixing paint. Tried to account for things that might lead them astray. Age and smoking and all them other habits that kill.\n\nAfter twenty years they had their answer written in blood and death. Two thousand heart attacks. Near eighteen hundred strokes. Over a thousand dead from their hearts or their heads giving out. But them that ate like them old Mediterranean people, they lived longer. Twenty nine percent longer than them that didn't. Like some old testament prophecy come true in hospital corridors and nursing stations. Eat of these foods and live. Eat of the others and die.",
            "The sign said Hitler lives in Burma and the girl held it there above her head in the gray morning light. The cardboard bent and weathered like something pulled from an ancient tomb. Standing alone on that corner like a prophet of old. The country they called Burma once and Myanmar now lay far across waters dark and deep where men in uniforms ruled with iron and blood since before most could remember. The military junta they called them. Words that meant nothing to the dead.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Orange robed like flames against the concrete and steel of the cities. The Saffron Revolution they named it but revolutions aint got much to do with spices and this one was no different. At first the government let them march. Let them gather. Then the violence came as it always does. Ancient monasteries ransacked and burning. Journalists rounded up or shot dead in the streets. One Japanese man named Nagai caught it there on the concrete while his camera kept rolling til the end.\n\nThey said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different stories. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the thousands. The government denied it as governments do. Ancient as time itself this need to rule. To stamp out the light wherever it shows. Roman emperors who called themselves gods. Japanese kings descended from heaven itself. Our own president taking counsel from prophets and madmen every seventh day.\n\nIn China they gunned down students in the streets of Tiananmen. The numbers changed depending on who did the counting but the dead stayed dead all the same. In Rwanda the Hutus killed their Tutsi neighbors with machetes and clubs til the streets ran red. And before all that there was Hitler. The girl with the sign knew. Knew how these things went. How they always went. Evil didnt die. It just moved on down the road looking for new places to root.",
            "The old jazzman's shadow stretched long across them decades like some dark thing that wouldnt die. Piano keys worn smooth by time and the endless nights. He didnt play much but when he did it was like rainwater falling soft on tin. His real power lay in knowing the souls of them that played for him. Each one carrying their own particular sound like a birthmark or a scar. He wrote the music but it wasnt just notes on paper. It was blood and breath.\n\nThe book men talk about something called Creole Love Call like it was just another piece of music but it wasnt. Voice rising up out of nowhere like some lost spirit crying in the dark. No words. No words needed. Just pure sound floating above them reeds like smoke. Blues wrapped around blues wrapped around blues six times over.\n\nFirst the voice comes pure as morning then turns rough like somebody dragged it through gravel. Then that trumpet crying through the mute like it knows something about suffering. Clarinet floating high and lonesome while the piano whispers underneath. Then the whole band takes up the cry, brass and reeds calling back and forth like wolves in the night. Fifth time through everything rises up fierce and wild, them reeds screaming high while brass and rhythm punch holes in the dark below. Last time voice comes back growling like some creature that aint human no more. At the end just a run of notes and that trombone laughing bitter and wrong.\n\nYear later he done Hot and Bothered. Miley on trumpet and Cox singing sounds that wasnt words, just pure music. Like they was having some kind of conversation that normal folks couldnt understand. Then that piece about swing, Nanton making that trombone talk like it had a human tongue. Playing sounds that wasnt never meant to come from brass and metal.\n\nThat was his gift. Taking human sounds and making them mechanical. Taking machine sounds and making them human. Mixing them all up till you couldnt tell which was which no more. Like some kind of dark alchemy. Like he knew something about music that wasnt in no books nowhere.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraling through time and space like some cosmic dance frozen in calcium. The old man Thompson had said it back in 1917 that no man could speak the language of these forms in numbers and equations and even now a hundred years hence they still could not. Not really.\n\nThe shells lay before him on the wooden table. Prunum specimens collected from waters he'd never see. Each one a record of life and death and the slow accretion of being. Mathematical models could tell you something of their growing but not everything. Never everything. They'd X-rayed them, fed numbers into machines called CerioShell that spat out predictions of what could be and what couldn't. As if the world needed telling.\n\nThe shell was a house built by its tenant, spiral upon spiral like the chambers of some infinite heart. Whorls, they called them. Each one marking time like rings in a tree, each one pressed against an axis running through the center that men had named columella though God knows what the creature called it. If it called it anything at all. The last chamber always the largest, like the final breath of a dying thing. They had names for every part. Apex and base and aperture. Words to cage the mystery but never quite holding it.\n\nYou could turn them this way and that. View them from above or below or straight on but they kept their secrets. Counting the whorls was like counting the years of the dead. Draw a line and start where the first suture begins, marking quarter turns like the phases of some calcium moon.\n\nThe path of growth could be tracked. Numbers assigned to the spacing and the width and the height as if that could capture the essence of the thing. As if mathematics could explain the why of it all. But the numbers were just shadows on the cave wall, telling nothing of the thing itself. Of what drove it to build in curves and spirals, to leave these empty houses scattered on the shores of time.\n\nHe touched one shell with a finger. Smooth and cold. Wondering what compulsion had driven its maker through the dark waters, adding layer upon layer in the blind faith that this was what it must do. This was its purpose. This was its being. Mathematical models could predict the possible but never the necessary. Never the why of it all.",
            "He studied the numbers before him, cold figures that spoke of death in the far reaches of those islands. Ten years and nothing changed. Children dying same as they always had. Mothers too. The government men had their goals written in fine ink on clean paper but the truth was darker, more brutal than their neat columns could tell.\n\nIn the cities now you might find someone who knew the way of birth. Seventy-two out of hundred they said. But these weren't doctors with their clean hands and sharp tools. Just women who'd seen enough blood to know its ways. When the bleeding started they had nothing but old ways and prayers. He'd seen it. The dark blood flowing like river water in the night.\n\nThe children still died of the flux, their small bodies wracked with it. Less help now than before. The numbers told that truth plain enough. In the towns where the roads were paved you might find a doctor to cut the baby free. Seven in hundred. But in the places where the dirt was still dirt and men lived close to the bone it was two. Just two. The math was simple as a knife.\n\nRich folk got their care. Poor folk died. Twenty-seven percent difference they called it. He called it blood money. Called it the price of being born wrong.\n\nThey talked about programs now. Special ways to fix special problems. But he knew better. Knew you couldn't patch a rotting house board by board. The whole thing needed tearing down, building new from foundation up. They'd tried it before with the plague that took men's blood. Threw money at it like water on a fire. But the fire just moved elsewhere, burned through the family planning houses instead. That's how money worked. Like water finding the low ground.\n\nThe papers piled up on desks. Forms in triplicate. Programs layered on programs like old paint, each one hiding the rot beneath. But the children still died. The mothers still bled. And the numbers stayed cold as stones.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown and spread like some dark vine across the century past, spawning genres uncountable, each one birthing more in its wake. They had names for them all. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk but these were just words men had given to something that defied naming. And from these came others still, subspecies breeding in the dark corners of sound until they became something else entirely.\n\nAmong these bastard children was one they called Heavy Metal. It came forth some forty years ago and grew like something feral, something that refused to be contained. It spoke in tongues of darkness and carried within it emotions raw and terrible as birth. Men saw in it something malleable, something that could be shaped and reformed endless times, and so they did.\n\nNow the thing has grown so vast and strange that none can say what it truly is anymore. It feeds on other sounds, other genres, consuming them and making them its own. To understand this thing you must go back to its beginning, to the dark soil from which it grew. For this aint no mere category of sound. This is something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nThe darkness lies at its core like a black seed. Everything about it demands more. More thunder in the bass, more volume to shatter eardrums, more violence in its execution. The players themselves became technicians of sound, masters of their craft in ways the old musicians never were. And always there were the drugs, flowing through the veins of the seventies like poison, making men create sounds that weren't of this earth. They used these chemicals like shamans use their herbs, to touch something beyond the veil of reality.\n\nIt carried within it something visceral, something that hadn't existed in the popular sounds that came before. It reached back to the dark romanticism of another age, pulling forth themes of death and decay and loss. Even the Beatles, those prophets of love and light, found themselves drawn to its power. They wrote Helter Skelter like men possessed, trying to outdo the Stones in their descent into the maelstrom. That song stands now like a marker, a sign pointing toward the darkness to come.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their wild visions, there was Rousseau. He who held his brushes like ancient tools of some forgotten ceremony. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this fever vision of woman and jungle and night. She lay there midst the dark fronds and violet blooms, pale as bone china in the spectral light, while all round her the jungle breathed and watched with golden eyes.\n\nHe'd come to painting late, had Rousseau. No schooling in the arts save what the world had writ upon his heart. Born to a tinsmith in Laval where the gray streets wound down to the river and the sounds of hammering rang out across the morning fog. For forty years he collected tolls, counted coins, watched faces pass. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. A counter of small coins. A keeper of minor gates.\n\nGrief walked with him like a shadow. Eight children born dead or dying. His wife Clémence taken too, leaving him with only Julia, this one daughter like a single candle burning in a vast and darkened room. And so he turned to paint and canvas like a man turns to prayer, seeking something that might fill the emptiness.\n\nHe worked in silence while around him others rose to fame. Matisse with his wild colors burning holes in canvas. But Rousseau, he painted slow and careful like a man trying to remember something seen in dreams. Some said he wanted only to be accepted, to make the kind of paintings that would open doors. But in his heart he knew. The jungle waited. The dreams came calling. And he answered them with brush and paint, making worlds that never were but somehow always had been.\n\nThe critics laughed. The galleries turned away. But still he painted on, each stroke a defiance, each canvas a door opened onto somewhere else. Somewhere in the dark beyond the firelight where the dreams still walked upright and spoke in tongues of flame and shadow.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them great minds what spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Something in that notion rang true deep down in the marrow of things. Old Keats had wrote it plain as day in his poem bout that old urn, said beauty and truth was one and the same and that was all any man needed knowing in this world. Most things a man learns comes from books or hard living but these things, the knowing of what's right and what's beautiful, they come to a man different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe remembered studying them paintings in museums, folk talking bout foreground and background and such, trying to pin down why something like that Mona Lisa woman spoke to the soul. But words failed. Always failed. People'd look at some painting or read some book that moved em and they'd say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Truth was you couldn't never capture it complete. That O'Connor woman knew it, said some things could only be told in stories cause regular words wouldn't do.\n\nThe boy looked up at him. What are you thinking about Papa?\n\nAbout truth and beauty son. About how they're like ghosts you can feel but cant never quite catch hold of.\n\nLike God?\n\nMaybe so. Maybe just so.\n\nHe thought on how both goodness and beauty worked on a man's soul in ways that couldn't be spoke proper. Like they was both reaching down from some higher place, touching something deep inside that was beyond telling. Them books he'd read talked about noumenal things, things that could be felt but not explained. That's what it was like. The knowing of right from wrong and the knowing of beauty, they was kin somehow. Connected in that deep place where words don't go.\n\nEspecially in them stories folk wrote. McKean had it right when he said stories was different from other arts cause they carried the weight of living in em. Values and such. The choosing between right and wrong. Just like real life only distilled down somehow. Pure. Like truth and beauty was just different words for the same thing after all.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold from the teeth of the alps down to where the Baltic meets the shore at Kiel, a place where men speak in low voices and the wind carries salt. This is Germany. The same blood runs through the veins of those who dwell by the Rhine at Köln as those who wake in Dresden where the Elbe cuts through stone like an ancient knife. The people carry something in them older than memory. Something that came before.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself is lost to time like footprints in ash, disputed by learned men who speak in whispers through dusty tomes. Tacitus, dead these thousand years, wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar too spoke of them. Called them Germanus in his writings of the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls like dogs but could not tame those who dwelt beyond the river. He took the word from the Gauls themselves, though what it meant none now living can say. Some claim it spoke of neighbors. Others say it named the spears they carried, dark instruments of death called ger, or maybe it came from garim, an old Irish word for shouting, for these were a people who made the very air tremble with their voices.\n\nTacitus wrote more. In 98 he put down words about these people, claiming they were pure as winter snow, unmixed with the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild country with its bitter sky and darker ways? Who indeed would leave warm southern lands for this place unless it was already branded on their soul?\n\nThe Romans would not. They sent their legions north for plunder and glory but always they returned south like birds in autumn, back to their marble halls and heated baths. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of this empire of stone and law, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in the ranks of armies not their own. They were there in the middle of that first century, watching, waiting, their destiny as yet unwritten in the book of days.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some vast tapestry of deception, each thread woven through with lies that must someday unravel or else consume the weaver whole. They'd called it Twelfth Night though it mightve been called anything. A story of masks and faces beneath masks and the terrible price of wearing either too long.\n\nThe girl Viola comes to strange shores. Comes walking out of the sea like some halfdrowned thing. She takes a mans clothes and a mans name as if such things could be borrowed like coins. Protection she called it. As if cloth and leather could ward off the worlds malice. But the disguise that saves can also damn and she found herself cut off from the women who mightve been sisters to her. Cast adrift in a wilderness of her own making.\n\nThe noble Olivia sees this false man Cesario and something burns in her that maybe shouldnt burn. Who can say if what she saw was the man that wasnt there or the woman beneath. She speaks the words husband stay and the echo of them hangs in the air like smoke. Even Orsino who thought himself immune to such confusion finds his heart speaking in strange tongues. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times. As if repetition could make the lie more true.\n\nThese people move through their world like sleepwalkers. Each one carrying some secret flame. Some hidden truth they dare not name. The disguise becomes a mirror and in it they see what they fear to see. What they hope to see. What was there all along.\n\nWhen the truth finally comes it comes like rain after drought. Washing away the masks. The pretense. Olivia finds her heart can shift like quicksilver from Cesario to Sebastian. As if love were nothing but a trick of light. A sister you are she, she says to Viola. As if family could be claimed as easily as changing clothes. But blood knows blood and perhaps in the end that's all that matters.\n\nIn this world of shadows and mirrors perhaps there are no true faces. Only the ones we choose to wear and the ones we're born with and sometimes you cant tell one from the other. The deception that saves can also destroy and in the end each must choose which truth to embrace and which to let slip away into the darkness like a dream half-remembered.",
            "He'd seen it in the books. German rule and what it brung. The Herero dead and the Nama too and the bones bleached white in that hard African sun. But you couldn't say it was all one thing or another. Nothing ever was.\n\nIn the east they'd found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like they'd been born to it. The British come in 1919 and there they were. In Kamerun too they'd done some good if you could call it that. If you could call any of it good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A hard land. Cruel. Like it had been born mean and stayed that way. No government schools there. Just missionaries working with what little they had which wasnt much. White children got their learning though. Got it good and proper with government money behind it. These things lasted. After the Germans were gone most blacks still couldn't read nor write nor cipher. Couldn't do none of it.\n\nHe studied the old papers. German mostly. Yellowed and crisp like dead leaves. Early writings just telling how things was. Later ones in English trying to make sense of it all. Compare this place to that place. Why things was different here than there. Cohen wrote on it. Said it was the settlers made it what it was.\n\nThe weather wasn't so bad in South West Africa. Not good neither but a man could live there if he had to. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come. More than anywhere else in German Africa. East Africa only had five thousand and some. Like they knew something. Like they could smell what was coming.\n\nThe land stretched out before him raw and empty. Desert mostly. The kind of place where a man's dreams die slow and hard. Where the past aint never really past and the future's just more of the same. Where education was just another way of saying who was gonna make it and who wasn't. Who was gonna live and who was gonna die.",
            "They stood there, the two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide of dust and blood. Fifty-seven years they watched and waited, from 1836 to 1893, marking time in the language of war and bitter memory. The war came in '46, when American boots ground Mexican earth beneath them and claimed Texas and the Southwest territories like a wolf claims the throat of its prey.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a river cut through stone. Catholic and Protestant, Spanish and English blood, each carrying the old world's poison in their veins. The border between them was a wound that wouldn't heal, leaking bandits and desperados like pus from an infection. Seventeen times they clashed, counting the moments between like a man counts the seconds before a hanging.\n\nThe border towns lay scattered like broken teeth along a jawline of desert. Raiders crossed back and forth, ghosts in the scorched earth carrying death in their saddlebags. Military men from both sides walked the line with iron in their hands and steel in their eyes, but the blood kept flowing like water in a dry creek after rain.\n\nThe rivalry was born in difference, in the way men look at God through different windows and see different shapes in the darkness. Americans feared the Catholic cross like they later feared the hammer and sickle, their Protestant hearts hardened against the old Spanish ways. These fears were carried across oceans in the holds of ships, passed down like dark heirlooms from England and Spain.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on American gold like a plant bends toward the sun. American eyes turned from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledger books instead of bodies.\n\nThey were like all border nations, these two. Locked together in a dance of blood and suspicion, until the music changed and they found new steps to follow. Only Mexico and Cuba, they said, only these caused such trouble in American minds, such persistent shadows in American dreams. The others, those further south, they kept their distance and their peace, watching from afar as the great beasts circled each other in their ancient ritual of rivalry and need.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness come. Never knew such a thing existed till it laid me flat. Was workin as a nurse then. Chose that path cause I needed something solid and sure, something I never had growing up. They kept telling me people would always need tending to, always get sick. So I turned away from what I wanted - to be writing about science and such - and took up nursing instead.\n\nThere I was. Forty-six years lived and alone. No money stored away and couldn't work no more. Still can't. After fifteen years living off government checks ain't got nothing to call mine anymore. Each day's a battle against the void, eating away at what little security remained. Nothing certain now except one truth that stands like bedrock: couldn't have made it without my people - family and them few friends that stuck. When disaster comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength you thought you had.\n\nFact is there'll always be trouble coming. Big or small, don't matter how ready you think you are. Some things just too vast to weather alone. Like them pioneers crossing the mountains west. Wasn't no rugged individual made it alone - was people helping people, sharing what little they had. Respect and mercy, that's what got them through.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't the truth of it. This country wasn't built on going it alone. Was built on people knowing their neighbors, helping when help was needed.\n\nGot my emergency supplies like anyone should. Water tablets and plastic sheeting. Duct tape for the windows case something biological comes. Flashlights and batteries and matches that'll light in the rain. Canned goods too. If you got land, work it. Put up food for winter. Get yourself a wood stove if you ain't living in them stacked-up boxes in town.\n\nBut while you're doing all that surviving, know your people. Know your neighbors. Cause when the real darkness comes, ain't no one makes it alone.",
            "He was born in the old world, a prince they say, five hundred years before the carpenter. They would call him Buddha. He walked away from his palace and his wealth and found something else entirely. Found enlightenment they called it. His words spread like wildfire through the east and became something else. Something called Buddhism. The Theravada they named it. Pure. Orthodox. Ancient.\n\nTwenty five hundred years gone now. Time changes all things. Even the words of gods. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters each year like some ritual older than memory. Monks in their robes. Common folk too. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down into the bones of belief itself. The sangha brotherhood and the folk who follow them have watched their teachings shift like sand in wind. Some changes came from within their walls some from without. Some meant harm. Some meant nothing at all.\n\nWords mean things here. Internal is what comes from their own. External what comes from strangers. Hostile means to harm. To break. To unmake what Buddha built. Benign means no harm intended though harm might come all the same. These words will walk with us through this tale.\n\nFirst you must know what lies at the heart. They seek refuge in three things. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient text. Suttas that tell the tales. Vinaya that makes the rules. Abhidhamma that speaks of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of Anatta - that no soul exists. Of Dukkha - that life is suffering. Of Anicca - that nothing lasts. Only by knowing these truths can one break free of the wheel. The endless cycle of death and birth they call Sansara. When it breaks so too breaks desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds mens minds.\n\nThe Vinaya speaks of how to live. Five rules for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Keep your loins in check. Stay clear of drink and smoke that clouds the mind. Monks have more chains to wear. But at the heart of it all lie four noble truths. First that life is suffering. Second that wanting makes us suffer. Third that suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

It dont rest easy in definitions or simple statements like Russians is stubborn or Japanese is accommodating. Such thoughts was poison to the mind of any man who aimed to deal with folk different from his own. Better to watch and wait. Better to see how the other's mind worked when confronted with the task at hand.\n\nWhen a man finds himself in foreign territory he cant help but measure it against the familiar ground of home. Like comparing the taste of strange water to the well you grew up drinking from. But understanding comes slow like winter thaw. It means studying their histories their hatreds their fears. Means accepting what you find without trying to reshape it like some child's clay. This was especial true if you came to the table with a weaker hand.\n\nCorporate culture was its own beast entirely. Each company like its own nation with borders drawn in dress codes and work hours and ways of speaking. Some demanded their workers wear suits like armor some let them come as they pleased.

Even within the same company you might find difference enough to start a war depending on whether you was in the city or out in some suburban outpost.\n\nValues was the bedrock of it all.

            "They'd spoken of God, these men of old. Fools and their hearts speaking empty words into the void. But there was Anselm and there was Aquinas and they'd walked different paths to the same dark water. No man could rightly judge between them without first accepting the God they sought, the one true God of scripture, terrible and ancient. To speak of other gods would be to speak of nothing at all.\n\nThey sat in their chambers, these holy men, writing by candlelight words that would echo through centuries. Anselm with his inward eye, searching the darkness of his own soul like a man in a cave feeling along the wet walls. He'd said that God lived in the understanding itself, that the very thought of such a being proved its existence. As if the mind could birth reality from its own red chambers. Faith was his lantern in that darkness.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He carried no lantern but the cold light of reason, following tracks in the dust of the world like a hunter. Five paths he'd marked out across the waste. Change. Causation. Contingency. Excellence. Harmony. Each one a trail leading to the same high ground. He believed a man could find God in the bones of the world itself, in the way things moved and changed, in the order that persisted in the chaos like a fingerprint in ash.\n\nThey were both right and both wrong, these ancient fathers. Each had found a piece of something larger than themselves but neither had grasped the whole. Like blind men describing an elephant, touching trunk or tusk or flank but never seeing the beast entire. Their words echoed still, carried on the wind like cinders, glowing briefly in the dark before going cold.\n\nThe truth was a thing that lived between their words, in the spaces they couldn't fill.

Gold and green and white and gray and the red that sometimes showed pink in the dawn light. These colors spoke their piece in his story and told things about people and places that words alone could not tell.\n\nWhite and gray spoke of sameness.

Down in them white canyons of New York where the buildings rose up like ancient monoliths. Gray names writ in Nick's book, fading already like they never was.

He'd seen it before, how the box treated dark flesh different from light, how some victims got remembered and others forgotten like dust in the wind.\n\nThe Med-Flight story came next. Small caliber round through metal skin, .22 they said. Somewhere out there in the vast dark a rifleman waited, five thousand dollars now the price of his name.\n\nWeather rolled through like thunder itself. Rain coming, they said. Heat holding in the eighties like fever in a dying man. Quick as it came it went, bait to keep eyes fixed to the screen.\n\nThen the UDF robbery on Clime Road. They lingered on the darkness of the man's skin like oil on water, six foot frame in a hooded shroud. One fifty on the scale. The words felt heavy with something unspoken, something that crawled beneath like insects under bark.\n\nLast came the kingpin Rodriguez, Texas man moving green weight north like migration. Three hundred months they gave him instead of twenty-five years, numbers dancing strange in the telling. Hispanic, they said, though it mattered none to the time he'd serve in concrete and steel.\n\nThe news ended like all things must, leaving him alone with thoughts of how stories get told, how some words carry weight while others drift away like ash in the wind, forgotten before they hit ground.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing born of man's endless want to possess and control what could not be controlled. To track and measure and quantify the measureless march of commerce across the waste of time.\n\nThe boy looked at him. What is it Papa?\n\nIts a way men tried to own pieces of the world without touching them. Like catching shadows in a box.\n\nThe numbers stretched across the page in their rigid formations. Each column a testament to man's futile attempt to impose order on chaos. The top holdings stood like sentinels. Ten of them. Accounting for 63.58 percent of all that was contained within. He ran his finger down the figures. Beta. Return. Standard deviation. Words that meant everything and nothing in the world that was.\n\nThey found that the return was higher in the ten than in the whole. 6.11 percent higher. A ghost of prosperity in a dead economy. The beta lower by point twelve. Numbers dancing their cold dance across the page like dead leaves in a winter wind.\n\nHe remembered the trading floors. The screens glowing blue in the darkness. Men in their dark suits watching the numbers rise and fall like the tide. All of it gone now. Ashes and dust.\n\nTo determine if the difference meant anything they would need to calculate the standard deviation. Another ritual. Another genuflection before the altar of statistical significance. The boy watched him work the figures.\n\nWhy do we need to know Papa?\n\nBecause knowing is all we have left.\n\nBut the numbers told no truth that could be trusted. They were ciphers in a dead language. Hieroglyphs on the wall of a tomb. The mathematics of a world that no longer existed.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and there it was plain as death. The numbers fell off a cliff that third month, like something had died in them. Winter had come to New England like it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that swept them clean. December it was, or what passed for December in these parts. The campus grew quiet. Students and teachers alike buried in their tasks like creatures before the storm. The commuter logs lay forgotten in desk drawers and computer screens, testimony to good intentions gone astray.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying. Halls echoed vacant and parking lots stretched bare under the cold sky. When they returned in January the numbers stayed low, as if something had broken that couldn't be fixed. February brought no relief. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, he thought. The fire burns bright at first then gutters out like a candle in wind.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March. A desperate measure maybe but it worked after its fashion, breathing some life back into the dying thing. But they couldn't escape the truth of it - the academic calendar was a kind of death to momentum, cutting the legs out from under any forward motion they might build.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. Cars were freedom. Independence. The open road stretching endless to the horizon. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't change what lay in his heart. They tried with their gifts - certificates for food and drink and comfort, for books and necessities. But it wasn't enough. He thought about bigger prizes - bicycles gleaming new under fluorescent lights, hybrid cars humming quiet as ghosts, electric vehicles that ran clean as winter air. If they'd done that, if they'd dangled those greater rewards like stars just out of reach, maybe the numbers wouldn't have fallen so far. Maybe the logs would have kept coming in through those dark winter months, testament to human persistence in the face of easier paths. But they hadn't done that. They'd kept to their modest offerings and watched the numbers fall like leaves in autumn, scattered by winds they couldn't control.",
            "I sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them old Edison films one by one. Fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared on the wall like spirits conjured up from some ancient projector grinding in the dark.\n\nThe films was mostly bound to stages like theater shows. Everything frontal and far off like you was watching through a window into another world. No movement of the camera. No getting close to the faces. Just figures moving side to side in their fixed space like marionettes on invisible strings. That's how it was back then. That's how they learned it from the vaudeville shows and magic acts that came before.\n\nIn Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel the figures moved like ghosts across the frame. Right to left. Left to right. Never coming closer never moving away. The camera watched unmoved like some dead-eyed god. That's how they all was. Every one of them trick films bound by rules older than the pictures themselves.\n\nThey shot everything from far off or middle distance. Never close. Never intimate. Like watching life through the wrong end of a telescope. The audience got what the stage gave them and nothing more. No faces. No details. Just the whole scene laid out before them like some moving tableau.\n\nMost of them films was just one shot. One minute or less of magic. Of vanishing. Of things appearing and disappearing like fever dreams. But they wasn't really one shot at all. They was pieces stitched together to fool the eye. Like that film of Mary Queen of Scots. If you looked close enough you could see where they'd cut it. Where they'd sewn the pieces together to make her head come off. But folks didn't look close back then. They just watched and believed in the magic of it all.\n\nThe films was like windows into another time. A time when pictures moved for the first time and people gathered in the dark to watch shadows dance on walls. When magic was still possible and tricks could still fool the eye. When the world was younger and simpler and full of wonder.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what them scholars say. Like some ancient thing dredged up from the black waters of time and set to dry in the modern sun. Some called it empty, others praised its terrible beauty like a storm rolling across the plains at night. When Walpole wrote that first one, The Castle of Otranto, he took what was dead and breathed life into it, made something that weren't quite alive nor dead but walked the earth nonetheless.\n\nHe built it from old timber and new nails, using them theatrical ways of the past mixed with what folk called the natural telling of things. Like some mad carpenter fashioning a house from bones of different beasts. Gothic it was called, though that word had been passed round so much it had worn smooth of meaning, like an old coin rubbed blank between too many fingers. Folk looked down on it, called it primitive against their fine modern sensibilities. But that marriage of old theatre-ways and the new intimate telling, that's what gave it power. Power that lingered like smoke in still air, making it both dead and alive to them that read it years later, centuries later.\n\nChivalry stood at the heart of it all, like some old oak in a dead forest. That medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got twisted and changed in Walpole's hands but never quite lost its shape. These Gothic writers, they saw something missing in their time, some honor or bravery that had leaked out of the world like water from a cracked jug. They looked back at them knights of old with longing, making heroes of shadows. Walpole himself was neck-deep in the political muck of his day, watching good men turn bad and true things turn false. Maybe he thought something pure had been lost, something that them knights of old had carried in their iron hearts.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic, painting him with all them old colors of chivalry. A prince who'd known suffering, marked by tragedy, thought to have fallen to the blades of infidels. He made him larger than life, like some statue carved too big for human proportion, excess piled on excess till it near toppled over with the weight of its own telling.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to the hands of them that would possess its yield. Oliver he was called, the man who gave it name back in eightytwo. A consultant. He reckoned it needed planning and watching and steering like some great beast that might otherwise run wild and wreck all in its path.\n\nSix parts it had, like the chambers of some industrial heart. Production and supply and inventory and location and the moving of things and the knowing of things. These the overseers used to feed the hunger of them that would buy.\n\nProduction stood first among them, like some dark foundation stone. It asked its questions. When. Why. Where. How. The overseers they had to know what the people wanted and they watched the marketplace like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what numbers to set down in their ledgers. Which things to make and how many and where to make them. They chose their grounds careful, like a man picking a place to make his stand.\n\nI worked once in them great stores, Walmart and Target both. Everything laid out just so, like a ritual. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take in the goods when they came. Everything written down in books like scripture.\n\nThe supply was the second thing. Strategic they called it. Core capabilities. Words that meant nothing and everything. Sometimes they'd split the work between different places, different hands. Sometimes theyd send it out beyond their walls to other makers, other shops. Velocity they called it. The hunger for speed and quality both, and the getting of it cheap. The eternal struggle between what things cost and what they're worth.\n\nEach overseer watching his own piece of the great mechanism, all of them connected like the bones in a spine. If one failed the whole thing could come apart. The shelves would empty. The people would hunger. And in the end it was all about the hunger, wasnt it? The endless hunger of a world that could never be filled.",
            "Dark and godless they were, them Victorian tales. All gilt and finery draped over the bones of the aristocracy like clothes on a hanged man. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Stories that carried mystery in their bowels like some biblical beast, strange and terrible tales that gave flesh to their characters in ways no parlor story ever could.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams. Walked with killers in his sleep while his mind burned with fever and pain. Sikes and Crackit moving through the dark like specters, their words hanging in the air like smoke. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights swimming in the dark. Pain everywhere and nowhere. Some hand he couldn't see dragging him through the void.\n\nTime itself bent and broke in these stories. Day becoming night becoming day, all of it meaningless. The boy had no control over any of it, no more than a leaf has control over the wind that carries it. The old jew Fagin had worked his devil's magic well, breaking the boy's spirit like you'd break a wild horse. Even with death reaching for him with both hands the boy couldn't fight. Wouldn't fight. Just let the darkness take him like it was his due.\n\nIn these moments the truth showed its face. Not in the fancy drawing rooms or behind lace curtains but in the fever dreams of a dying boy. In the spaces between heartbeats when the world goes quiet and a soul can hear its own echo.",
            "Two years past I worked with the young ones after their schooling had ended for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. English mostly and some reading. One of them teachers come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, couldn't say which now. Said he couldn't read right. Watched him struggle with the letters like they was foreign things. Some he knew true as sunrise but others may as well have been marks in the dust. Brown skin that boy had and spoke English clean as any of them but something wasnt right.\n\nDays went by. We worked at it. Then come a day when his mother appeared in that tired classroom while the others was gone on some venture. She stood there and no English passed her lips. Only Spanish words I barely understood with what little I knew of that tongue. Standing there I saw it clear as bones in the desert. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters proper. Whether that knowing helped him none I cant say.\n\nI tell this tale cause of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the words we give them. Even them that speak it good as anyone. Adrian he just needed teaching in our letters and sounds but there's many who need more than that. Aint no simple answer neither. Two-language learning. Throwing them in with the rest. Special teachers. None of these alone will do it.\n\nWhat works is all of it together like a wall of stones. Each piece holding the other. Teaching two tongues aint just for them that speak Spanish first. Studies show it makes all of them sharper. Some folks fear it. Say it wastes what little we got. They're wrong as wrong can be. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues but we need some that do. Like guideposts in the dark. Showing the way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant wrap your mind around no matter how hard you try. Some folk take their children to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some to temples made of stone and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth they think might be there. Most just take what their mothers and fathers gave them like a hand me down coat. Others spit on the very notion that anything could be bigger than their own small world. A man might choose one way of believing then cast it off like snakeskin for another. Whatever path we take we're all searching for that thing that makes us whole. Looking for that light in the black that'll guide us home.\n\nMe and my father sat on the porch that day. Rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Both of us with cigarettes. The gutters running full and drowning out the flowers below. Cardinal, he said when I asked him what bird he liked best. He stared out into the rain like a man trying to remember something he'd lost. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's. His hair thin and patchy where it used to be thick. He wouldn't look at me and I couldn't speak of what was coming because speaking makes a thing real. I moved closer and hugged him and we both watched the rain fall in the failing light of that June evening.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and their machines bought him a few more months of suffering and I never could reckon the worth of that. What sort of God would do such a thing. I laid in the dark those nights. No prayers passed my lips. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI wouldn't watch him die. Couldn't. You cant watch the life that made you while it leaves this world. I wanted to keep him how he lived not how he died. I knew him better than any of them did. Better than his own kin. And I knew he wouldn't want his only child watching while death took him. So I curled up in my bed and waited three days for word.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "The man called Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his land and knew the worth of soil and seed and sovereignty. In those early days of the Republic he stood testament to the old ways, though he was no stranger to the halls of power where men spoke of governance and law. But it was the earth that shaped him and gave weight to his words about freedom and the rights of men to work their own ground.\n\nHe saw in this new country something that had never been before. A land unbound by the old ghosts of tradition. A place where men might govern themselves if they had the courage for it. He knew that rights were like bones in the body of liberty. Break one and the whole corpus fails. These things must remain beyond the reach of any government lest all be lost.\n\nThe world of nature he knew was red of tooth and claw where the strong preyed upon the weak but civilization could not abide such ways. He saw that government must account for the darkness in men's hearts while preserving what light remained. Good and evil moved through his thoughts like wind through winter wheat. As government is exercised by man all its virtues and vices must be human, he wrote, knowing the truth of it in his bones.\n\nHe believed good principles were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that improved the tilling of soil, that stood against the moneyed interests who would make all men slaves to coin and paper. Self-interest drove all things but turned poisonous when it led men to feed upon their brothers.\n\nLike others who stood for the old Republic he held to the Constitution's words with iron certainty. The federal power must be bound and limited lest it grow fat and tyrannous on the people's bread. Yet he knew too that words alone were dangerous things without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true charter, for it spoke of sovereign states and not one nation bound in chains of power. He saw these truths as clear as he saw the furrows in his fields, and spoke them with the same certainty that seeds would sprout in spring.",
            "He stood there watching. The porcelain bowl white and cold beneath the fluorescent lights that hummed like distant wasps. His mind moved through the scene like water over stone, taking nothing with it, leaving nothing behind. Just the watching.\n\nHe remembered a book. Some woman had told him about it once, an artist woman who spoke of the right side of the brain and how to see what was real in the world. How to frame it. How to make it small enough to understand. But there wasnt any frame for this. No way to make it smaller or more comprehensible. It was what it was.\n\nThe brown mass lay there in the bottom of the bowl like some primitive creature pulled up from the depths of the earth. Like something that had no business in the world of men. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was his color now. Brown. The color of endings. The color of what gets left behind.\n\nHis hand found the lever and pulled. Water swirled and moved like spirits in the bowl but the thing remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again and watched the water rise and fall. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The green tie at his throat felt like a noose.\n\nHe stood with his feet set wide on the tiles. The mop beside him like some useless weapon. The paper rolled off the roll like bandages for some wound that wouldnt heal. Layer after layer wrapped around his hand until it was something else entirely. Not a hand anymore but a tool. A thing for doing what needed doing.\n\nWhen he reached into the bowl his arm moved slow and careful like a man reaching into the mouth of something that might wake up and bite. The water was cold. Everything was cold. The world was cold and this was what was left of it. This was what they paid him for. This was what men did.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers and charts but the dead care nothing for such things. The National Institute speaks of brains not ready, not formed, like wet clay not yet hardened in the kiln of years. But there is more to it than that. More darkness in the hearts of the young.\n\nHe watched them on the roads. Inexperienced. Raw. Their vehicles rolling and tumbling like dead leaves in an autumn wind. Speed demons chasing something they could not name. The asphalt calling to them like some dark siren song.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves. Studies done in the southern lands of California showed the truth of it. The more of them together, the more bones scattered on the roadside. States tried to cage them with paper laws. Provisional licenses. Time restrictions. But laws are just words on paper and the young have always held such things in contempt.\n\nThe psychologist Zuckerman knew. Even at eighteen the blood runs hot and wild. They seek the thrill like addicts seeking the needle. The rush of speed and danger coursing through their veins like some precious poison. He had seen it in their eyes. That hunger. That need.\n\nBy the year 2010 they would come in waves. The children of the boom times reaching driving age like some great migration. Millions of them. The roads would run red with their passing.\n\nThe solution lay in waiting. Let them learn in classrooms and simulators but keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them practice under watchful eyes. Six hours behind the wheel. Fifty hours with an adult present. Like an apprenticeship to survival.\n\nThe law would need to be universal. Coast to coast. Border to border. One rule for all the young. It was not a new idea. Others had spoken it before. But sometimes old medicine is the strongest medicine. Sometimes the old ways are the only ways.\n\nHe thought of all the young ones yet to die. Their faces unknown but their fates already written in the cold equations of probability. Perhaps there was still time to save them. Perhaps. But time was like water in a cracked vessel. Running out. Always running out.",
            "The boy watched him scrawl upon the yellowed paper with a worn pencil stub. Words about the broken ones, them that cant hear right in their heads. Not deaf mind you but somethin worse. Like their brains was wrapped in cotton. Like God himself had reached down and pulled some wires loose just to see what might happen.\n\nHe wrote about them that studied it first. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. Back in fifty-four when the world was younger and less cruel. They'd sit with children broken in ways you couldn't see and they'd make their tests and write their findings in thick leather books now turned to ash somewhere.\n\nThe afflicted ones they'd tested couldn't place sounds in the world like normal folk. Couldn't tell which way a voice came from or pick one voice from many. Like trying to catch fish in muddy water with your bare hands. Some couldn't hear the difference tween a question and a threat, couldn't make sense of the simplest things said to them. Their brains betrayed them. Simple as that.\n\nThey got doctors now that'll test for it. Audiologists they call em. White coats and clipboards and machines that measure the echoes in your head. They'll sit you down and whisper numbers in your ears and make you repeat em back. They'll ask you questions about what you hear and don't hear and write it all down in their precise hand like scribes recording the words of prophets. But there aint no one test that'll tell you for certain. No machine that can look inside and point to the broken part and say here, here's your trouble. The cause remains a mystery, like most terrible things in this world.\n\nHe set down the pencil and studied what he'd written. Words marching across the page like soldiers heading to war. Each one carrying its own weight of meaning. Each one a testament to the ways we break and the ways we try to mend what's broken.",
            "The boy sat on the couch and his eyes were wild with fear like some trapped animal. He knew what was coming. They all did. The social work it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night. Not then maybe but soon enough. The darkness in mens souls and the things they visit upon their children. I had seen it before. Would see it again.\n\nThe degree in psychology hanging on the wall like some talisman against the evil that men do. But it wasnt enough. Never was. The police they stood in the yard that day watching. Just watching. The parents in their hollow righteousness spouting words like manipulative and simple disputes but their eyes betrayed them. Evil has a look to it. You see it enough times you dont forget.\n\nI knew then what I had to become. A worker in the darkness. Someone to stand between the innocent and the void. The values burned in me like a flame. Service. Justice. Ethics. Words that mean nothing until they mean everything. Until they're all that stands between a child and the darkness that would swallow them whole.\n\nI had always been different. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Metal in my flesh like some tribal marking. A warrior for the different ones. The lost ones. The gay and the straight and all the spaces between. Fighting the old battles against hate and ignorance. These were my people. The ones society wanted to make invisible.\n\nThe social work it calls to you like a siren song. Like something ancient and true. You either hear it or you dont. And if you hear it you cant unhear it. It becomes the thing that drives you. The thing that wakes you in the night. Because out there in the darkness children are crying and someone has to answer. Someone has to stand in the doorway between innocence and evil and say no further. This far and no further.\n\nAnd that's what I aim to do. To stand in that doorway until they plant me in the ground. Because evil never sleeps and the innocent need their warriors. Their protectors. Their workers in the social dark.",
            "The dark shapes of sleep and wakefulness move through us like spirits in the night. They come unbidden and go as they please and we are powerless against their ministrations. In the laboratory they keep mice in small metal cages and study how sleep comes to them or doesnt. The scientists speak of things called neurons firing in the hypothalamus, orexin coursing through the brain like some biblical flood. They speak of receptors called GABAB as if naming old testament prophets. These receptors they say govern the coming of sleep and its going.\n\nThe mice they study are not unlike us in their need for rest. Their small hearts beating in the dark of their cages while the white-coated priests of science watch and make their marks in leather-bound books. They speak of something called baclofen that makes the mice sleep longer and deeper. As if sleep itself could be caught and measured and weighed like grain.\n\nThere are those among us who cannot sleep. Who lie awake in the vast darkness while the world turns beneath them. Their genes carry some ancient curse passed down through blood and bone from father to son and mother to daughter. The absence of proper receptors in their brains leaving them to wander the midnight hours like restless ghosts. \n\nThe scientists say their research with the mice can tell us about ourselves. About why some can sleep and others cannot. About how this failure of sleep moves through families like some dark inheritance. How it destroys lives as surely as any plague - taking first the ability to work, then to think, then finally the will to go on living in a world without rest.\n\nThey keep their mice in metal cages and study them and make their marks in books but the truth of sleep remains mysterious as death. The neurons fire or they dont. The receptors work or they fail. And in the end we are all at the mercy of forces we barely understand, forces as old as the darkness itself.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like water through a sieve. Dark mornings walking east from Stuart Hall where they'd put me that first year, far out on the edge of things where the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray sky. Twenty-five minutes by foot to Willard if the weather held. Weather rarely held. Some old timer told me bout how it was before. Said East Halls stood alone out there like some outpost, nothin but empty land between. Not anymore. Sports fields now. New buildings risen up like concrete monuments. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment blocks crowding round like mourners at a wake. Campus growing like some living thing, reaching out across the valley floor. Distance growing with it.\n\nBicycle's the answer. Simple as that. But answers aint worth nothing without action behind em. Need riders. Need paths. Need the whole damn thing built right.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said bikes was the only true way. Bowl of oatmeal'll take you thirty miles if you're willing. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best thing I ever done. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minutes walking. Five minutes riding if you pump hard enough. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it aint friendly. Like some river of humanity flowing both ways, everyone in their own world, everyone moving like the world's about to end.\n\nWalking's good for the soul maybe but time aint kind. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's precious out here. Time's all we got.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words again. Words about a world that never was but might yet be. The book lay heavy in his hands like some ancient tome speaking prophecies of darkness. Brave New World they called it. Weren't nothing brave about it though.\n\nThe world in them pages was a cold one. Clinical. Everything measured out in droppers and test tubes, life itself parsed and portioned like medicine. Community they called it but it weren't no community he'd ever known. Just people moving like machines, thinking thoughts put there by others. The Controller watching over it all like some dark god in his high tower.\n\nMarx had seen it coming maybe. That old prophet of the working man speaking through time about false consciousness and hegemony. Big words for simple truths. The truth that men could be made to love their chains if you gilded them proper. In that brave new world they'd done just that, made folk happy to be slaves. Deltas and Gammas and all manner of greek-lettered souls moving through their days like sleepwalkers, dreaming dreams fed to them in the dark while they slept.\n\nWeren't no real love in that world. No passion neither. Just bodies moving against bodies, mechanical-like. Men speaking of women like they was talking about the weather, clinical words about pneumatic this and pneumatic that. Women too, talking about their couplings like they was discussing what they had for breakfast. All of it hollow. Empty as a dead man's eyes.\n\nHe thought about them social classes, stacked up like cord wood. Each one content in their place cause they'd been told to be content. Consuming and obeying and never questioning why. The upper classes watching it all, knowing maybe but not caring. All of them caught in the same machine, just different gears turning different ways.\n\nThe whole thing speaking to something deeper. Something about how men lose their souls when machines and money become their gods. How technology and capitalism together could strip a man down to nothing but wants and needs, all manufactured proper-like by them that knew how. A warning maybe, written in ink but speaking in blood.\n\nHe closed the book. Outside the wind moved through dead trees, whispering secrets to no one at all.",
            "The class on Islam came to me four winters past at CBC, dark thoughts weighing on minds like storm clouds. They spoke of hostility in the faith, voices rising and falling like wind through dead grass. The question hangs heavier now than it did then, like a noose waiting for its neck.\n\nI watched how the papers and screens changed their telling after the towers fell. First came the rage, hot and blind as wildfire. Then something else. A kind of forced kindness, stretched thin as spiderweb. Strange days these are when a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. The words dont match the deeds, like footprints leading two ways. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise. I seen how he took the tribes, one after another, blade first then faith following. Yet here in these pages they paint him soft as lamplight, a martyr walking through sand and time, people following him like lost sheep finding water.\n\nThey wrote him performing works that mirror the Christ's own doing. Took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men till they could eat no more. These words feel hollow, like bones picked clean. They wanted him holy, needed him holy, but the truth is a different beast altogether. It's a theft of sacred things, taking Christ's glory and draping it over their own prophet like a borrowed cloak.\n\nThe stories come third-hand or worse, passed mouth to mouth like desert gossip. Someone heard from someone who heard from another, on and on till truth gets lost in the telling. They meant it for proof but it reads like smoke, nothing solid to grasp.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they made him gentle when gentleness wasnt in him. They wrote of wisdom and humility but the blood tells different. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true shape of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the stories, believing what they need to believe.",
            "The truth of the Christ and what he spoke in his time was lost quick as breath in winter, scattered to winds that carried new thoughts across the land after his passing. Like tracks in ash swept clean. Looking back across the years you could see how the teaching got further and further from where it started, like a man walking away from his home till he cant see it no more behind him. These days theres a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasnt there before. The old ones still cling to what their fathers told them but they grow fewer, like trees in a burned forest.\n\nThe Christians that remain will come to see what was lost. Theyll hunger for it like men dying of thirst. Theyll want to peel back the layers of words men put over the words of God like paint over paint until they find what was first written there. Maybe it'll take a hundred years. Maybe more. But it'll come sure as winter follows fall. They'll strip it down piece by piece, like taking apart an old house board by board till nothing stands but the foundation that Jesus himself laid down. When this thing sweeps through the old countries itll carry people with it like leaves in a river. The church will still stand but itll be different. Simpler. More like it was.\n\nWhere once there were a thousand different ways to worship therell be just one. Like streams joining to make a river. The differences between men will wash away like footprints in rain. History's got a way of turning back on itself, like a snake eating its own tail. Time was when Romans killed Christians in the streets but then Rome itself knelt down before the cross. This country once kept men in chains and now those same men's sons sit in high places. The wheel keeps turning.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading a map but like reading poetry. Looking for the truth behind the words instead of in them. To understand how we got here you got to go back. Back before there was any such thing as Christian. Back when there was only the old religion of the Jews. They believed in one God and holy books and divine revelation. But even then they were split five ways - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who followed none of these. Each claiming they knew the truth of things.",
            "They was greedy folk them owners and managers and they knew it deep in their guts but they didnt care none. The factories rose up like great black mountains against the sky and the smoke poured forth like rivers of death flowing to the ends of the earth. Aint no man ever looked down from them heights and saw anything worth saving below. The workers was just numbers to them. Numbers on paper written in ink black as their hearts.\n\nThe place they called Packingtown was a hellhole of suffering where men and women worked themselves to bone and marrow for scraps while the bosses grew fat on their misery. Loyalty was a word that held no meaning there. Everything had its price and a man's worth was measured in dollars and cents. The owners would sooner see a worker dead than spend a penny more than they had to. That was the truth of it plain and cold as winter.\n\nThe smoke rolled thick and black across the sky and the stench of death and rot hung in the air like a curse. Animal waste ran in rivers through the streets mixing with the blood and the filth. But them that owned the place they just watched from their offices high above counting their money while below the people suffered and died.\n\nWasnt no laws to protect them workers back then. No safety regulations nor nothing to keep the owners from working them till they dropped dead on the killing floors. The unions that come along they was just as bad. Vultures picking at the bones of them that was already half dead from the work. Most of them workers was foreigners desperate for any kind of work and the owners knew it. Used it against them like a whip.\n\nThey was slaves in all but name. Living on the edge of starvation day after day dependent on the mercy of men who had none to give. The morality of such a place was like everything else there corrupted and diseased. The whole system was rotten through and through like meat left too long in the sun. And there wasnt no escape from it neither. Not for them that was caught in its grip.",
            "The darkness lay over Dreamland like a shroud, black and ancient as time itself. In those pages Poe had writ the word Thulé, scratched it there twice as though marking the borders of some forsaken realm. The word itself carried echoes of Virgil's voice across the centuries, speaking of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the Greeks had drawn their maps to end in mist and legend.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten into Poe's blood like a fever. Their words moved through him like dark water through deep caves.\n\nThere was Goethe. His Faust stood like a monument, carved in two great pieces across the years - first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death finally took him. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed beyond the veil, leaving him nothing but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep from both until neither could sustain him. When the end came he gave away his kingdom like a man shrugging off a heavy coat, keeping only that cup, that last token of love. Then he walked out onto the cliffs above the sea, black water moving below. The goblet caught the light one final time before he cast it into the depths. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into darkness.\n\nThe shade of that tale fell across Poe's \"Dream-Land\" like an evening shadow. He wrote of Thule twice, bookending his verses with that ancient word as though to mark the borders of that desolate realm. His speaker wandered landscapes stripped of color, haunted by the ghosts of dead companions, moving through a world as empty as the one Goethe's king had left behind.\n\nThe connection ran deeper than chance. Poe knew Goethe's work - how could he not? It moved through the literary world like blood through veins. When they spoke of Tennyson, Poe would nod, knowing the threads that bound them all together across the dark waters of influence and time. The reproductions of Goethe's work spread like ripples in still water, touching everything. Even Grattan had shaped Faust anew in 1842, barely a year before Poe set down \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" with its own whispered mention of ultima Thule.",
            "They'd tell stories later about that day at D&D Markets. About the applesauce that lay there like some pale viscous blood upon the floor and how Martin sat in his office eating while fate worked its slow arithmetic in the aisles beyond. The spill had come at five. Wayne had seen it first. Told Martin who sat there behind his desk with his dinner laid out before him like some pagan offering to darker gods. Didn't have time for customer complaints he'd said. His voice flat and dead as winter.\n\nFifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came. She too bore witness to the creeping danger in aisle four but Martin would not be moved. He sat immobile as stone while time crept past like a thief in the night. Half past five Palmer came. She never saw what took her feet from under her. Never saw the applesauce gleaming dull and treacherous in the fluorescent light. Her back broke bad and she fell into darkness deeper than any night.\n\nThe law spoke of malice and oppression and fraud. Spoke of despicable acts committed with willful disregard. Six souls had fallen in those aisles that year alone. Six victims to negligence and indifference cold as the tile floor itself. The judges knew such things. Had seen them written in blood and broken bones across the years. Taylor's case spoke of dangerous consequences known but not heeded. Of willful failure to act when action might have saved.\n\nMartin knew. He knew and still he sat. Still he ate while danger waited patient as a rattler in the aisles. The law would not look kindly on such things. Would not shield him from the punishment such calculated indifference called forth. Palmer's claim would stand. The courts would hear her tale of woe and pain. Of a manager who chose his dinner over duty. Who let peril stalk his store while he supped in safety.\n\nThe law was clear as morning. Clear as the applesauce that lay there waiting. Punitive damages would come like judgment day. No summary dismissal would save them now. The facts lay bare as bones and twice as damning. They would pay in coin and conscience both.",
            "The wanting had come early. Like a shadow that follows but never catches up. Started when she was fourteen and lingered still at seventeen, a ghost of need that wouldnt rest. Not a thing she needed no. A someone. But the boys that came didnt matter none. They'd circle like crows round a dying thing, awkward in their courtship, but she felt nothing for them. Nothing at all. She'd lay awake studying the ceiling, questioning what darkness lived inside her that made her this way. Years passed like that. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet mostly. Her folks were peaceful folk who rarely raised their voices, save when their daughter's wild spirit crashed against their stillness like waves on stone. She was their opposite, full of life and light that drew others to her like moths to flame. Good hearted too. Kind.\n\nBut this day wasnt quiet. No. This day carried something else. She wandered room to room searching for something she couldn't name when her mother's scream cut through the silence like broken glass. Kitchen. She ran. Found her mother laid out on the tile floor, face twisted in pain, breath coming short and sharp.\n\nMama what's wrong? She knelt beside her mother who could barely speak through the hurt. Hospital, her mother managed. Just take me there.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms from all them classes she'd taken. Carried her to the car and laid her in the back like something precious and broken. Drove fast through streets gone colorless with worry.\n\nThe hospital reeked of death and cleaning fluid but she noticed none of it. Just carried her mother through them sliding doors calling for help until white-coated figures appeared like ghosts from the fluorescent haze. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left the girl alone with her fear.\n\nLater they told her. Her mother had been reaching for some old vase, balanced on a stepstool like a bird on a wire. Then gravity remembered her and brought her down hard to the unforgiving earth.",
            "They watched them dying year by year. Hearts giving out like old clockwork, blood vessels clogged and useless. The nurses knew. They'd seen it before and they'd see it again. Seventy four thousand of them watching and waiting and marking their charts with what they ate and what they didn't. Mediterranean style they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from ancient trees. No meat to speak of. Like them old desert people used to eat before the world went wrong.\n\nThe women they studied weren't sick yet. Not with the sugar disease nor the heart troubles. Thirty eight to sixty three years old they was. Every few years they'd write down what passed their lips. Everything catalogued like a church inventory. Two decades of eating and dying. Some quit the study but most stayed on. Faithful as converts to some old religion.\n\nThe doctors checked every death. Every seized-up heart, every blood vessel burst in the brain. They'd look at papers and records and death certificates like archaeological artifacts. Sometimes there weren't no records to speak of. They called them probable cases and counted them anyway. Seventeen percent of the strokes. Twenty four percent of the heart attacks that didn't kill.\n\nThey kept track of everything. Weight and smoking and pills they took. Whether their monthly blood still came or if it had stopped. Whether they moved their bodies or just sat still. Like bookkeepers tallying up the accounts of lives lived and lost.\n\nThey used numbers to wash away the noise. Averaged everything together like mixing paint. Tried to account for things that might lead them astray. Age and smoking and all them other habits that kill.\n\nAfter twenty years they had their answer written in blood and death. Two thousand heart attacks. Near eighteen hundred strokes. Over a thousand dead from their hearts or their heads giving out. But them that ate like them old Mediterranean people, they lived longer. Twenty nine percent longer than them that didn't. Like some old testament prophecy come true in hospital corridors and nursing stations. Eat of these foods and live. Eat of the others and die.",
            "The sign said Hitler lives in Burma and the girl held it there above her head in the gray morning light. The cardboard bent and weathered like something pulled from an ancient tomb. Standing alone on that corner like a prophet of old. The country they called Burma once and Myanmar now lay far across waters dark and deep where men in uniforms ruled with iron and blood since before most could remember. The military junta they called them. Words that meant nothing to the dead.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Orange robed like flames against the concrete and steel of the cities. The Saffron Revolution they named it but revolutions aint got much to do with spices and this one was no different. At first the government let them march. Let them gather. Then the violence came as it always does. Ancient monasteries ransacked and burning. Journalists rounded up or shot dead in the streets. One Japanese man named Nagai caught it there on the concrete while his camera kept rolling til the end.\n\nThey said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different stories. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the thousands. The government denied it as governments do. Ancient as time itself this need to rule. To stamp out the light wherever it shows. Roman emperors who called themselves gods. Japanese kings descended from heaven itself. Our own president taking counsel from prophets and madmen every seventh day.\n\nIn China they gunned down students in the streets of Tiananmen. The numbers changed depending on who did the counting but the dead stayed dead all the same. In Rwanda the Hutus killed their Tutsi neighbors with machetes and clubs til the streets ran red. And before all that there was Hitler. The girl with the sign knew. Knew how these things went. How they always went. Evil didnt die. It just moved on down the road looking for new places to root.",
            "The old jazzman's shadow stretched long across them decades like some dark thing that wouldnt die. Piano keys worn smooth by time and the endless nights. He didnt play much but when he did it was like rainwater falling soft on tin. His real power lay in knowing the souls of them that played for him. Each one carrying their own particular sound like a birthmark or a scar. He wrote the music but it wasnt just notes on paper. It was blood and breath.\n\nThe book men talk about something called Creole Love Call like it was just another piece of music but it wasnt. Voice rising up out of nowhere like some lost spirit crying in the dark. No words. No words needed. Just pure sound floating above them reeds like smoke. Blues wrapped around blues wrapped around blues six times over.\n\nFirst the voice comes pure as morning then turns rough like somebody dragged it through gravel. Then that trumpet crying through the mute like it knows something about suffering. Clarinet floating high and lonesome while the piano whispers underneath. Then the whole band takes up the cry, brass and reeds calling back and forth like wolves in the night. Fifth time through everything rises up fierce and wild, them reeds screaming high while brass and rhythm punch holes in the dark below. Last time voice comes back growling like some creature that aint human no more. At the end just a run of notes and that trombone laughing bitter and wrong.\n\nYear later he done Hot and Bothered. Miley on trumpet and Cox singing sounds that wasnt words, just pure music. Like they was having some kind of conversation that normal folks couldnt understand. Then that piece about swing, Nanton making that trombone talk like it had a human tongue. Playing sounds that wasnt never meant to come from brass and metal.\n\nThat was his gift. Taking human sounds and making them mechanical. Taking machine sounds and making them human. Mixing them all up till you couldnt tell which was which no more. Like some kind of dark alchemy. Like he knew something about music that wasnt in no books nowhere.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraling through time and space like some cosmic dance frozen in calcium. The old man Thompson had said it back in 1917 that no man could speak the language of these forms in numbers and equations and even now a hundred years hence they still could not. Not really.\n\nThe shells lay before him on the wooden table. Prunum specimens collected from waters he'd never see. Each one a record of life and death and the slow accretion of being. Mathematical models could tell you something of their growing but not everything. Never everything. They'd X-rayed them, fed numbers into machines called CerioShell that spat out predictions of what could be and what couldn't. As if the world needed telling.\n\nThe shell was a house built by its tenant, spiral upon spiral like the chambers of some infinite heart. Whorls, they called them. Each one marking time like rings in a tree, each one pressed against an axis running through the center that men had named columella though God knows what the creature called it. If it called it anything at all. The last chamber always the largest, like the final breath of a dying thing. They had names for every part. Apex and base and aperture. Words to cage the mystery but never quite holding it.\n\nYou could turn them this way and that. View them from above or below or straight on but they kept their secrets. Counting the whorls was like counting the years of the dead. Draw a line and start where the first suture begins, marking quarter turns like the phases of some calcium moon.\n\nThe path of growth could be tracked. Numbers assigned to the spacing and the width and the height as if that could capture the essence of the thing. As if mathematics could explain the why of it all. But the numbers were just shadows on the cave wall, telling nothing of the thing itself. Of what drove it to build in curves and spirals, to leave these empty houses scattered on the shores of time.\n\nHe touched one shell with a finger. Smooth and cold. Wondering what compulsion had driven its maker through the dark waters, adding layer upon layer in the blind faith that this was what it must do. This was its purpose. This was its being. Mathematical models could predict the possible but never the necessary. Never the why of it all.",
            "He studied the numbers before him, cold figures that spoke of death in the far reaches of those islands. Ten years and nothing changed. Children dying same as they always had. Mothers too. The government men had their goals written in fine ink on clean paper but the truth was darker, more brutal than their neat columns could tell.\n\nIn the cities now you might find someone who knew the way of birth. Seventy-two out of hundred they said. But these weren't doctors with their clean hands and sharp tools. Just women who'd seen enough blood to know its ways. When the bleeding started they had nothing but old ways and prayers. He'd seen it. The dark blood flowing like river water in the night.\n\nThe children still died of the flux, their small bodies wracked with it. Less help now than before. The numbers told that truth plain enough. In the towns where the roads were paved you might find a doctor to cut the baby free. Seven in hundred. But in the places where the dirt was still dirt and men lived close to the bone it was two. Just two. The math was simple as a knife.\n\nRich folk got their care. Poor folk died. Twenty-seven percent difference they called it. He called it blood money. Called it the price of being born wrong.\n\nThey talked about programs now. Special ways to fix special problems. But he knew better. Knew you couldn't patch a rotting house board by board. The whole thing needed tearing down, building new from foundation up. They'd tried it before with the plague that took men's blood. Threw money at it like water on a fire. But the fire just moved elsewhere, burned through the family planning houses instead. That's how money worked. Like water finding the low ground.\n\nThe papers piled up on desks. Forms in triplicate. Programs layered on programs like old paint, each one hiding the rot beneath. But the children still died. The mothers still bled. And the numbers stayed cold as stones.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown and spread like some dark vine across the century past, spawning genres uncountable, each one birthing more in its wake. They had names for them all. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk but these were just words men had given to something that defied naming. And from these came others still, subspecies breeding in the dark corners of sound until they became something else entirely.\n\nAmong these bastard children was one they called Heavy Metal. It came forth some forty years ago and grew like something feral, something that refused to be contained. It spoke in tongues of darkness and carried within it emotions raw and terrible as birth. Men saw in it something malleable, something that could be shaped and reformed endless times, and so they did.\n\nNow the thing has grown so vast and strange that none can say what it truly is anymore. It feeds on other sounds, other genres, consuming them and making them its own. To understand this thing you must go back to its beginning, to the dark soil from which it grew. For this aint no mere category of sound. This is something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nThe darkness lies at its core like a black seed. Everything about it demands more. More thunder in the bass, more volume to shatter eardrums, more violence in its execution. The players themselves became technicians of sound, masters of their craft in ways the old musicians never were. And always there were the drugs, flowing through the veins of the seventies like poison, making men create sounds that weren't of this earth. They used these chemicals like shamans use their herbs, to touch something beyond the veil of reality.\n\nIt carried within it something visceral, something that hadn't existed in the popular sounds that came before. It reached back to the dark romanticism of another age, pulling forth themes of death and decay and loss. Even the Beatles, those prophets of love and light, found themselves drawn to its power. They wrote Helter Skelter like men possessed, trying to outdo the Stones in their descent into the maelstrom. That song stands now like a marker, a sign pointing toward the darkness to come.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their wild visions, there was Rousseau. He who held his brushes like ancient tools of some forgotten ceremony. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this fever vision of woman and jungle and night. She lay there midst the dark fronds and violet blooms, pale as bone china in the spectral light, while all round her the jungle breathed and watched with golden eyes.\n\nHe'd come to painting late, had Rousseau. No schooling in the arts save what the world had writ upon his heart. Born to a tinsmith in Laval where the gray streets wound down to the river and the sounds of hammering rang out across the morning fog. For forty years he collected tolls, counted coins, watched faces pass. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. A counter of small coins. A keeper of minor gates.\n\nGrief walked with him like a shadow. Eight children born dead or dying. His wife Clémence taken too, leaving him with only Julia, this one daughter like a single candle burning in a vast and darkened room. And so he turned to paint and canvas like a man turns to prayer, seeking something that might fill the emptiness.\n\nHe worked in silence while around him others rose to fame. Matisse with his wild colors burning holes in canvas. But Rousseau, he painted slow and careful like a man trying to remember something seen in dreams. Some said he wanted only to be accepted, to make the kind of paintings that would open doors. But in his heart he knew. The jungle waited. The dreams came calling. And he answered them with brush and paint, making worlds that never were but somehow always had been.\n\nThe critics laughed. The galleries turned away. But still he painted on, each stroke a defiance, each canvas a door opened onto somewhere else. Somewhere in the dark beyond the firelight where the dreams still walked upright and spoke in tongues of flame and shadow.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them great minds what spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Something in that notion rang true deep down in the marrow of things. Old Keats had wrote it plain as day in his poem bout that old urn, said beauty and truth was one and the same and that was all any man needed knowing in this world. Most things a man learns comes from books or hard living but these things, the knowing of what's right and what's beautiful, they come to a man different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe remembered studying them paintings in museums, folk talking bout foreground and background and such, trying to pin down why something like that Mona Lisa woman spoke to the soul. But words failed. Always failed. People'd look at some painting or read some book that moved em and they'd say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Truth was you couldn't never capture it complete. That O'Connor woman knew it, said some things could only be told in stories cause regular words wouldn't do.\n\nThe boy looked up at him. What are you thinking about Papa?\n\nAbout truth and beauty son. About how they're like ghosts you can feel but cant never quite catch hold of.\n\nLike God?\n\nMaybe so. Maybe just so.\n\nHe thought on how both goodness and beauty worked on a man's soul in ways that couldn't be spoke proper. Like they was both reaching down from some higher place, touching something deep inside that was beyond telling. Them books he'd read talked about noumenal things, things that could be felt but not explained. That's what it was like. The knowing of right from wrong and the knowing of beauty, they was kin somehow. Connected in that deep place where words don't go.\n\nEspecially in them stories folk wrote. McKean had it right when he said stories was different from other arts cause they carried the weight of living in em. Values and such. The choosing between right and wrong. Just like real life only distilled down somehow. Pure. Like truth and beauty was just different words for the same thing after all.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold from the teeth of the alps down to where the Baltic meets the shore at Kiel, a place where men speak in low voices and the wind carries salt. This is Germany. The same blood runs through the veins of those who dwell by the Rhine at Köln as those who wake in Dresden where the Elbe cuts through stone like an ancient knife. The people carry something in them older than memory. Something that came before.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself is lost to time like footprints in ash, disputed by learned men who speak in whispers through dusty tomes. Tacitus, dead these thousand years, wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar too spoke of them. Called them Germanus in his writings of the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls like dogs but could not tame those who dwelt beyond the river. He took the word from the Gauls themselves, though what it meant none now living can say. Some claim it spoke of neighbors. Others say it named the spears they carried, dark instruments of death called ger, or maybe it came from garim, an old Irish word for shouting, for these were a people who made the very air tremble with their voices.\n\nTacitus wrote more. In 98 he put down words about these people, claiming they were pure as winter snow, unmixed with the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild country with its bitter sky and darker ways? Who indeed would leave warm southern lands for this place unless it was already branded on their soul?\n\nThe Romans would not. They sent their legions north for plunder and glory but always they returned south like birds in autumn, back to their marble halls and heated baths. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of this empire of stone and law, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in the ranks of armies not their own. They were there in the middle of that first century, watching, waiting, their destiny as yet unwritten in the book of days.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some vast tapestry of deception, each thread woven through with lies that must someday unravel or else consume the weaver whole. They'd called it Twelfth Night though it mightve been called anything. A story of masks and faces beneath masks and the terrible price of wearing either too long.\n\nThe girl Viola comes to strange shores. Comes walking out of the sea like some halfdrowned thing. She takes a mans clothes and a mans name as if such things could be borrowed like coins. Protection she called it. As if cloth and leather could ward off the worlds malice. But the disguise that saves can also damn and she found herself cut off from the women who mightve been sisters to her. Cast adrift in a wilderness of her own making.\n\nThe noble Olivia sees this false man Cesario and something burns in her that maybe shouldnt burn. Who can say if what she saw was the man that wasnt there or the woman beneath. She speaks the words husband stay and the echo of them hangs in the air like smoke. Even Orsino who thought himself immune to such confusion finds his heart speaking in strange tongues. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times. As if repetition could make the lie more true.\n\nThese people move through their world like sleepwalkers. Each one carrying some secret flame. Some hidden truth they dare not name. The disguise becomes a mirror and in it they see what they fear to see. What they hope to see. What was there all along.\n\nWhen the truth finally comes it comes like rain after drought. Washing away the masks. The pretense. Olivia finds her heart can shift like quicksilver from Cesario to Sebastian. As if love were nothing but a trick of light. A sister you are she, she says to Viola. As if family could be claimed as easily as changing clothes. But blood knows blood and perhaps in the end that's all that matters.\n\nIn this world of shadows and mirrors perhaps there are no true faces. Only the ones we choose to wear and the ones we're born with and sometimes you cant tell one from the other. The deception that saves can also destroy and in the end each must choose which truth to embrace and which to let slip away into the darkness like a dream half-remembered.",
            "He'd seen it in the books. German rule and what it brung. The Herero dead and the Nama too and the bones bleached white in that hard African sun. But you couldn't say it was all one thing or another. Nothing ever was.\n\nIn the east they'd found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like they'd been born to it. The British come in 1919 and there they were. In Kamerun too they'd done some good if you could call it that. If you could call any of it good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A hard land. Cruel. Like it had been born mean and stayed that way. No government schools there. Just missionaries working with what little they had which wasnt much. White children got their learning though. Got it good and proper with government money behind it. These things lasted. After the Germans were gone most blacks still couldn't read nor write nor cipher. Couldn't do none of it.\n\nHe studied the old papers. German mostly. Yellowed and crisp like dead leaves. Early writings just telling how things was. Later ones in English trying to make sense of it all. Compare this place to that place. Why things was different here than there. Cohen wrote on it. Said it was the settlers made it what it was.\n\nThe weather wasn't so bad in South West Africa. Not good neither but a man could live there if he had to. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come. More than anywhere else in German Africa. East Africa only had five thousand and some. Like they knew something. Like they could smell what was coming.\n\nThe land stretched out before him raw and empty. Desert mostly. The kind of place where a man's dreams die slow and hard. Where the past aint never really past and the future's just more of the same. Where education was just another way of saying who was gonna make it and who wasn't. Who was gonna live and who was gonna die.",
            "They stood there, the two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide of dust and blood. Fifty-seven years they watched and waited, from 1836 to 1893, marking time in the language of war and bitter memory. The war came in '46, when American boots ground Mexican earth beneath them and claimed Texas and the Southwest territories like a wolf claims the throat of its prey.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a river cut through stone. Catholic and Protestant, Spanish and English blood, each carrying the old world's poison in their veins. The border between them was a wound that wouldn't heal, leaking bandits and desperados like pus from an infection. Seventeen times they clashed, counting the moments between like a man counts the seconds before a hanging.\n\nThe border towns lay scattered like broken teeth along a jawline of desert. Raiders crossed back and forth, ghosts in the scorched earth carrying death in their saddlebags. Military men from both sides walked the line with iron in their hands and steel in their eyes, but the blood kept flowing like water in a dry creek after rain.\n\nThe rivalry was born in difference, in the way men look at God through different windows and see different shapes in the darkness. Americans feared the Catholic cross like they later feared the hammer and sickle, their Protestant hearts hardened against the old Spanish ways. These fears were carried across oceans in the holds of ships, passed down like dark heirlooms from England and Spain.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on American gold like a plant bends toward the sun. American eyes turned from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledger books instead of bodies.\n\nThey were like all border nations, these two. Locked together in a dance of blood and suspicion, until the music changed and they found new steps to follow. Only Mexico and Cuba, they said, only these caused such trouble in American minds, such persistent shadows in American dreams. The others, those further south, they kept their distance and their peace, watching from afar as the great beasts circled each other in their ancient ritual of rivalry and need.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness come. Never knew such a thing existed till it laid me flat. Was workin as a nurse then. Chose that path cause I needed something solid and sure, something I never had growing up. They kept telling me people would always need tending to, always get sick. So I turned away from what I wanted - to be writing about science and such - and took up nursing instead.\n\nThere I was. Forty-six years lived and alone. No money stored away and couldn't work no more. Still can't. After fifteen years living off government checks ain't got nothing to call mine anymore. Each day's a battle against the void, eating away at what little security remained. Nothing certain now except one truth that stands like bedrock: couldn't have made it without my people - family and them few friends that stuck. When disaster comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength you thought you had.\n\nFact is there'll always be trouble coming. Big or small, don't matter how ready you think you are. Some things just too vast to weather alone. Like them pioneers crossing the mountains west. Wasn't no rugged individual made it alone - was people helping people, sharing what little they had. Respect and mercy, that's what got them through.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't the truth of it. This country wasn't built on going it alone. Was built on people knowing their neighbors, helping when help was needed.\n\nGot my emergency supplies like anyone should. Water tablets and plastic sheeting. Duct tape for the windows case something biological comes. Flashlights and batteries and matches that'll light in the rain. Canned goods too. If you got land, work it. Put up food for winter. Get yourself a wood stove if you ain't living in them stacked-up boxes in town.\n\nBut while you're doing all that surviving, know your people. Know your neighbors. Cause when the real darkness comes, ain't no one makes it alone.",
            "He was born in the old world, a prince they say, five hundred years before the carpenter. They would call him Buddha. He walked away from his palace and his wealth and found something else entirely. Found enlightenment they called it. His words spread like wildfire through the east and became something else. Something called Buddhism. The Theravada they named it. Pure. Orthodox. Ancient.\n\nTwenty five hundred years gone now. Time changes all things. Even the words of gods. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters each year like some ritual older than memory. Monks in their robes. Common folk too. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down into the bones of belief itself. The sangha brotherhood and the folk who follow them have watched their teachings shift like sand in wind. Some changes came from within their walls some from without. Some meant harm. Some meant nothing at all.\n\nWords mean things here. Internal is what comes from their own. External what comes from strangers. Hostile means to harm. To break. To unmake what Buddha built. Benign means no harm intended though harm might come all the same. These words will walk with us through this tale.\n\nFirst you must know what lies at the heart. They seek refuge in three things. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient text. Suttas that tell the tales. Vinaya that makes the rules. Abhidhamma that speaks of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of Anatta - that no soul exists. Of Dukkha - that life is suffering. Of Anicca - that nothing lasts. Only by knowing these truths can one break free of the wheel. The endless cycle of death and birth they call Sansara. When it breaks so too breaks desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds mens minds.\n\nThe Vinaya speaks of how to live. Five rules for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Keep your loins in check. Stay clear of drink and smoke that clouds the mind. Monks have more chains to wear. But at the heart of it all lie four noble truths. First that life is suffering. Second that wanting makes us suffer. Third that suffering can end."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Only at Gatsby's did the colors run wild and free, bleeding their primary songs into the night.\n\nThe white kept coming like a tide. Down in them white canyons of New York where the buildings rose up like ancient monoliths. Gray names writ in Nick's book, fading already like they never was. Catherine's building just another slice in that great white cake of sameness that stretched on forever. Everything uniform and proper and dead inside.\n\nHe used these colors like a man uses tools. When he wanted to show something wasnt special he'd dress it in white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had their white girlhood, whatever that meant. The valley of ashes was gray as death itself, gray cars and gray land and gray people walking through it all like ghosts. That Italian child on the train, gray as yesterday's dreams. The old man selling dogs, gray as time itself.\n\nThen he'd take them colors and paint Daisy with them. White dress, white car, everything about her white as bones bleached in the sun. It showed what she was. Just another piece in the game, something Gatsby wanted cause he thought it would make him whole. But it wouldn't. Nothing would. Her fur collar gray as morning fog, her dress white as a shroud before the storm broke between Tom and Gatsby. White and gray telling their story without saying a word.",
            "The county lay stretched beneath the merciless sun, a patchwork of fields and orchards stitched together by old fences and dirt roads, the land itself a testament to what men could wrench from soil given water enough and time. Tomatoes grew blood-red in their rows and citrus hung like small suns in the groves. Leafy things. Green things. The peaches and lemons and berries all grown in this blessed warmth that knew no season. Lists of them written in ledgers and on computer screens but the truth of their existence was in the dirt and the calloused hands that worked it.\n\nThey called it organic now, this way of farming like the old ones did. Folk with money would pay more for such things, eggs and milk and vegetables grown without the poison that other farmers spread on their land like a curse. Waiting lists grew long as scripture. The farmers opened their gates sometimes, let city folk walk their paths and watch their birds and pretend at being close to the earth again.\n\nThe land itself lay near Potrero, one hundred and sixty acres of scrub and grass and oak trees pressed against the Cleveland Forest like a child against its mother. The government men had their plans for it, their lists of creatures they meant to save. Kangaroo rats and yellow-legged frogs and butterflies that danced on winds older than memory. The gnatcatcher too, that small gray prophet of better days.\n\nIndians had walked this ground first. Then the cattlemen came with their herds and their axes, claiming squares of earth with paper and ink, turning the wild things to meat and timber. The ground remembered though. It remembered everything.\n\nTo farm such land right took more sweat than chemicals ever did. Weeds needed pulling, bugs needed picking, the soil itself needed feeding like a hungry child. But the old ways brought back the wild things. Birds returned. The ground grew rich again. A man could lose money doing it this way but there were programs, government men with clipboards who'd help if you let them tell you how to manage your own dirt.\n\nThey had a name for this piece of earth too. Called it the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, wrote it down in their conservation plans like giving it a name would keep it safe. But the land didn't know its name. It knew only the sun and the rain and the patient turning of seasons, the slow pulse of life that moved through it like blood through veins, ancient and unstoppable as God.",
            "Brothers carry a bond that runs deeper than blood and bone, deeper than memory itself. They know each other in ways no others can know them and see in each other's eyes the reflection of their own souls laid bare. In the darkest hours this bond shows its true nature whether that nature be merciful or cruel. These moments birth consequences that cannot be undone and leave marks that cannot be unseen. When brother looks upon brother he sees not what others might see but what truly dwells in the heart of both. Their actions speak louder than any words could and in those actions lie the truth of who they are.\n\nIn the story they call The Scarlet Ibis two brothers walked this path through the swamps and marshlands of their youth. The older brother carried within him a pride that burned like fire and the younger one named Doodle bore the weight of being less than what his brother had dreamed of. They moved through a world of cypress knees and spanish moss, through places where the mud was black as pitch and the water ran slow and dark. The older boy had wanted someone to race with through Old Woman Swamp, someone to climb the great pine behind the barn, someone to swim the dark waters to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle's heart was weak as wet paper and the doctors said he might not live at all.\n\nThe older brother's thoughts turned dark then. He would look at the infant lying there pale and small and think about pressing a pillow to that tiny face until the breathing stopped. But then one day the baby smiled at him and something in that smile reached down into whatever dark place such thoughts had come from and pulled them out by the roots. Even so the pride remained, burning away inside him like a coal that would not die. That pride would lead them both down paths that could not be unmade and into a darkness from which only one would return.",
            "The brain. He'd seen it once, gray and wet and pulsing beneath the broken shell of a man's skull. Like some ancient machine built by forgotten hands. No computer this. No mere collection of wires and circuits but something more terrible in its complexity. Something godlike.\n\nHe thought about how it worked. How it took the world and made it real. Light and sound and touch coming in through the senses like thieves in the night, transformed into electricity and chemicals that coursed through neural pathways like rivers through a darkened landscape. Bottom-up they called it. Top-down. Words that meant nothing and everything.\n\nThe attention filter was there too, deciding what was worthy and what wasnt. Like some cosmic doorman at the gates of consciousness. You could hear your name spoken soft in a crowded room but the individual blades of grass beneath your feet might as well not exist. Unless they did. Unless they had to.\n\nMemory was different. It came in pieces. Sensory memory that lasted mere seconds. Working memory that held on longer, electricity moving through loops of neurons like cars on an endless track. Then there was the long-term. Proteins twisted into shapes that held the past like fossils in stone. Sometimes they broke down. Sometimes they didnt.\n\nThe scientists had their models. Their networks of nodes and connections. Chair connected to table connected to wooden connected to nothing and everything all at once. But he knew better. The brain wasnt just connections and pathways. It was more than that. It was the sum of all things. The repository of all that was and all that would be.\n\nHe thought about the man's brain again. How it had looked there in the dim light. How it had ceased its endless calculations and gone still. How it had taken with it everything that man had ever known or loved or feared. Everything that man had ever been. In the end it was just meat. Just protein and fat gone cold in the night. But it had been something else once. Something more. Something terrible and beautiful and impossible to fully comprehend.",
            "The money was gone. All of it. Like water through sand in some forsaken desert where no man walked and no bird flew. Two thousand and seven it was when the great wheels of commerce ground to their halt and the nation stood idle and mute before what was to come. Men without work and homes standing empty and the corporations that had stood like granite mountains laid low and broken in the dust.\n\nThey'd ask later how such things could be. How the world could turn so swift and terrible upon itself like some rabid beast. The answer lay in the hearts of men who wore fine suits and sat in tall buildings. Men who knew nothing of consequence or suffering. Who dealt in paper promises that held no weight. Who took the dreams of common folk and turned them into poison.\n\nIn the time before, during Clinton's reign, the seeds were planted. Like a cancer growing quiet and malevolent. The banks were told to give money to them that couldn't pay it back. Steven Holmes wrote the truth of it in the Times though none would heed his words. Fannie Mae, he said. Government men pushing them to lend to the poor while shareholders howled for blood in the form of profit. Holmes saw what was coming like a prophet in the wilderness. Saw the government would have to save them all just like they done before with the savings and loans. But no one listened. No one ever does.\n\nThey made new kinds of debt. Strange mutations of the old ways. Adjustable-rates and mortgage-backed papers and collateralized obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. The whole nation betting on houses like drunk men at a crooked card table. When it fell it fell hard. The five great banks of investment holding four point one trillion in bad paper. Thirty percent of everything the nation made or did or had. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies. Lehman Brothers torn apart like a carcass in the desert. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley brought to heel under government chains. Fannie and Freddie five trillion in debt and the government taking them over like some kind of failed state.\n\nThe nation watched it all happen like a man watching his house burn. Helpless. Mute. Knowing things would never be the same again.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached white in a merciless sun. They told nothing of truth. Nothing of life. Just dry facts scattered like ash across paper, meaningless as the wind that howls through empty doorways of abandoned homes.\n\nWriter sits at her desk and knows. Knows deep in that place where knowing lives that the telling aint the showing and never was. Never could be. The stories that matter they dont come in lists of facts and figures. They come in blood and breath and heartbeat.\n\nShe remembers a man once. Air Force man working nights at a filling station out on Highway 9. Man with two wedding rings in a drawer somewhere and no young ones to speak of. Spent his Sundays with a pole in his hand watching the river flow past like time itself. Had dreams bigger than that station but smaller than the sky he used to fly in. Ate his eggs fancy style that morning like every morning, yolk running yellow as old memories.\n\nBut that aint the way to tell it. Story needs meat on its bones. Needs sinew and muscle to move it forward. Characters got to breathe and bleed and die right there on the page or they aint worth the ink that made them. Dialog has to cut like a knife or heal like a mother's touch. Every word's got to earn its place.\n\nExposition is the devil's own voice whispering sweet lies. Telling you to get it all out quick and dirty. Skip the heart of it. Skip the soul. But there aint no story without soul. Never was. Never will be. \n\nTruth is you got to let them live. Let them speak. Let them move through the world you made them leaving tracks deep enough to follow. Got to give them time to show who they are. What they want. What they fear in the dark of night when sleep wont come.\n\nAnything less is just bones in the desert. Just dust in the wind.",
            "He watched the screen flicker in the dark of morning, the news from Columbus casting shadows on the wall. First came word of Ashley, where a man named Hostettler had taken blade to wife. His mugshot stared back through the glass, eyes black as pitch, soul darker still. They gave it two minutes and moved on like wind through dead grass.\n\nThen came the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone from this world now by bullet in Sharon Woods. No killer found, though SWAT moved through the streets like wraiths. The story passed quick as summer rain, and he knew why. He'd seen it before, how the box treated dark flesh different from light, how some victims got remembered and others forgotten like dust in the wind.\n\nThe Med-Flight story came next. Small caliber round through metal skin, .22 they said. Somewhere out there in the vast dark a rifleman waited, five thousand dollars now the price of his name.\n\nWeather rolled through like thunder itself. Rain coming, they said. Heat holding in the eighties like fever in a dying man. Quick as it came it went, bait to keep eyes fixed to the screen.\n\nThen the UDF robbery on Clime Road. They lingered on the darkness of the man's skin like oil on water, six foot frame in a hooded shroud. One fifty on the scale. The words felt heavy with something unspoken, something that crawled beneath like insects under bark.\n\nLast came the kingpin Rodriguez, Texas man moving green weight north like migration. Three hundred months they gave him instead of twenty-five years, numbers dancing strange in the telling. Hispanic, they said, though it mattered none to the time he'd serve in concrete and steel.\n\nThe news ended like all things must, leaving him alone with thoughts of how stories get told, how some words carry weight while others drift away like ash in the wind, forgotten before they hit ground.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing born of man's endless want to possess and control what could not be controlled. To track and measure and quantify the measureless march of commerce across the waste of time.\n\nThe boy looked at him. What is it Papa?\n\nIts a way men tried to own pieces of the world without touching them. Like catching shadows in a box.\n\nThe numbers stretched across the page in their rigid formations. Each column a testament to man's futile attempt to impose order on chaos. The top holdings stood like sentinels. Ten of them. Accounting for 63.58 percent of all that was contained within. He ran his finger down the figures. Beta. Return. Standard deviation. Words that meant everything and nothing in the world that was.\n\nThey found that the return was higher in the ten than in the whole. 6.11 percent higher. A ghost of prosperity in a dead economy. The beta lower by point twelve. Numbers dancing their cold dance across the page like dead leaves in a winter wind.\n\nHe remembered the trading floors. The screens glowing blue in the darkness. Men in their dark suits watching the numbers rise and fall like the tide. All of it gone now. Ashes and dust.\n\nTo determine if the difference meant anything they would need to calculate the standard deviation. Another ritual. Another genuflection before the altar of statistical significance. The boy watched him work the figures.\n\nWhy do we need to know Papa?\n\nBecause knowing is all we have left.\n\nBut the numbers told no truth that could be trusted. They were ciphers in a dead language. Hieroglyphs on the wall of a tomb. The mathematics of a world that no longer existed.",
            "They studied Figure 17 and there it was plain as death. The numbers fell off a cliff that third month, like something had died in them. Winter had come to New England like it always did, merciless and raw, and the bicycles stood abandoned and the footpaths emptied save for the wind that swept them clean. December it was, or what passed for December in these parts. The campus grew quiet. Students and teachers alike buried in their tasks like creatures before the storm. The commuter logs lay forgotten in desk drawers and computer screens, testimony to good intentions gone astray.\n\nThe holiday season descended like a shroud and with it came the great emptying. Halls echoed vacant and parking lots stretched bare under the cold sky. When they returned in January the numbers stayed low, as if something had broken that couldn't be fixed. February brought no relief. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, he thought. The fire burns bright at first then gutters out like a candle in wind.\n\nThey created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March. A desperate measure maybe but it worked after its fashion, breathing some life back into the dying thing. But they couldn't escape the truth of it - the academic calendar was a kind of death to momentum, cutting the legs out from under any forward motion they might build.\n\nThe deeper truth lay in the American soul itself. Cars were freedom. Independence. The open road stretching endless to the horizon. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't change what lay in his heart. They tried with their gifts - certificates for food and drink and comfort, for books and necessities. But it wasn't enough. He thought about bigger prizes - bicycles gleaming new under fluorescent lights, hybrid cars humming quiet as ghosts, electric vehicles that ran clean as winter air. If they'd done that, if they'd dangled those greater rewards like stars just out of reach, maybe the numbers wouldn't have fallen so far. Maybe the logs would have kept coming in through those dark winter months, testament to human persistence in the face of easier paths. But they hadn't done that. They'd kept to their modest offerings and watched the numbers fall like leaves in autumn, scattered by winds they couldn't control.",
            "I sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them old Edison films one by one. Fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared on the wall like spirits conjured up from some ancient projector grinding in the dark.\n\nThe films was mostly bound to stages like theater shows. Everything frontal and far off like you was watching through a window into another world. No movement of the camera. No getting close to the faces. Just figures moving side to side in their fixed space like marionettes on invisible strings. That's how it was back then. That's how they learned it from the vaudeville shows and magic acts that came before.\n\nIn Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel the figures moved like ghosts across the frame. Right to left. Left to right. Never coming closer never moving away. The camera watched unmoved like some dead-eyed god. That's how they all was. Every one of them trick films bound by rules older than the pictures themselves.\n\nThey shot everything from far off or middle distance. Never close. Never intimate. Like watching life through the wrong end of a telescope. The audience got what the stage gave them and nothing more. No faces. No details. Just the whole scene laid out before them like some moving tableau.\n\nMost of them films was just one shot. One minute or less of magic. Of vanishing. Of things appearing and disappearing like fever dreams. But they wasn't really one shot at all. They was pieces stitched together to fool the eye. Like that film of Mary Queen of Scots. If you looked close enough you could see where they'd cut it. Where they'd sewn the pieces together to make her head come off. But folks didn't look close back then. They just watched and believed in the magic of it all.\n\nThe films was like windows into another time. A time when pictures moved for the first time and people gathered in the dark to watch shadows dance on walls. When magic was still possible and tricks could still fool the eye. When the world was younger and simpler and full of wonder.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again, least thats what them scholars say. Like some ancient thing dredged up from the black waters of time and set to dry in the modern sun. Some called it empty, others praised its terrible beauty like a storm rolling across the plains at night. When Walpole wrote that first one, The Castle of Otranto, he took what was dead and breathed life into it, made something that weren't quite alive nor dead but walked the earth nonetheless.\n\nHe built it from old timber and new nails, using them theatrical ways of the past mixed with what folk called the natural telling of things. Like some mad carpenter fashioning a house from bones of different beasts. Gothic it was called, though that word had been passed round so much it had worn smooth of meaning, like an old coin rubbed blank between too many fingers. Folk looked down on it, called it primitive against their fine modern sensibilities. But that marriage of old theatre-ways and the new intimate telling, that's what gave it power. Power that lingered like smoke in still air, making it both dead and alive to them that read it years later, centuries later.\n\nChivalry stood at the heart of it all, like some old oak in a dead forest. That medieval notion of what makes a proper knight, it got twisted and changed in Walpole's hands but never quite lost its shape. These Gothic writers, they saw something missing in their time, some honor or bravery that had leaked out of the world like water from a cracked jug. They looked back at them knights of old with longing, making heroes of shadows. Walpole himself was neck-deep in the political muck of his day, watching good men turn bad and true things turn false. Maybe he thought something pure had been lost, something that them knights of old had carried in their iron hearts.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic, painting him with all them old colors of chivalry. A prince who'd known suffering, marked by tragedy, thought to have fallen to the blades of infidels. He made him larger than life, like some statue carved too big for human proportion, excess piled on excess till it near toppled over with the weight of its own telling.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the land, from raw earth to the hands of them that would possess its yield. Oliver he was called, the man who gave it name back in eightytwo. A consultant. He reckoned it needed planning and watching and steering like some great beast that might otherwise run wild and wreck all in its path.\n\nSix parts it had, like the chambers of some industrial heart. Production and supply and inventory and location and the moving of things and the knowing of things. These the overseers used to feed the hunger of them that would buy.\n\nProduction stood first among them, like some dark foundation stone. It asked its questions. When. Why. Where. How. The overseers they had to know what the people wanted and they watched the marketplace like seers reading entrails, trying to divine what numbers to set down in their ledgers. Which things to make and how many and where to make them. They chose their grounds careful, like a man picking a place to make his stand.\n\nI worked once in them great stores, Walmart and Target both. Everything laid out just so, like a ritual. How to wear the clothes they gave you, how to take in the goods when they came. Everything written down in books like scripture.\n\nThe supply was the second thing. Strategic they called it. Core capabilities. Words that meant nothing and everything. Sometimes they'd split the work between different places, different hands. Sometimes theyd send it out beyond their walls to other makers, other shops. Velocity they called it. The hunger for speed and quality both, and the getting of it cheap. The eternal struggle between what things cost and what they're worth.\n\nEach overseer watching his own piece of the great mechanism, all of them connected like the bones in a spine. If one failed the whole thing could come apart. The shelves would empty. The people would hunger. And in the end it was all about the hunger, wasnt it? The endless hunger of a world that could never be filled.",
            "Dark and godless they were, them Victorian tales. All gilt and finery draped over the bones of the aristocracy like clothes on a hanged man. But there were two that walked a different path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Stories that carried mystery in their bowels like some biblical beast, strange and terrible tales that gave flesh to their characters in ways no parlor story ever could.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams. Walked with killers in his sleep while his mind burned with fever and pain. Sikes and Crackit moving through the dark like specters, their words hanging in the air like smoke. Then gunfire split the night and screams rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights swimming in the dark. Pain everywhere and nowhere. Some hand he couldn't see dragging him through the void.\n\nTime itself bent and broke in these stories. Day becoming night becoming day, all of it meaningless. The boy had no control over any of it, no more than a leaf has control over the wind that carries it. The old jew Fagin had worked his devil's magic well, breaking the boy's spirit like you'd break a wild horse. Even with death reaching for him with both hands the boy couldn't fight. Wouldn't fight. Just let the darkness take him like it was his due.\n\nIn these moments the truth showed its face. Not in the fancy drawing rooms or behind lace curtains but in the fever dreams of a dying boy. In the spaces between heartbeats when the world goes quiet and a soul can hear its own echo.",
            "Two years past I worked with the young ones after their schooling had ended for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. English mostly and some reading. One of them teachers come to me about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third or fourth grade, couldn't say which now. Said he couldn't read right. Watched him struggle with the letters like they was foreign things. Some he knew true as sunrise but others may as well have been marks in the dust. Brown skin that boy had and spoke English clean as any of them but something wasnt right.\n\nDays went by. We worked at it. Then come a day when his mother appeared in that tired classroom while the others was gone on some venture. She stood there and no English passed her lips. Only Spanish words I barely understood with what little I knew of that tongue. Standing there I saw it clear as bones in the desert. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters proper. Whether that knowing helped him none I cant say.\n\nI tell this tale cause of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the words we give them. Even them that speak it good as anyone. Adrian he just needed teaching in our letters and sounds but there's many who need more than that. Aint no simple answer neither. Two-language learning. Throwing them in with the rest. Special teachers. None of these alone will do it.\n\nWhat works is all of it together like a wall of stones. Each piece holding the other. Teaching two tongues aint just for them that speak Spanish first. Studies show it makes all of them sharper. Some folks fear it. Say it wastes what little we got. They're wrong as wrong can be. We dont need every teacher speaking two tongues but we need some that do. Like guideposts in the dark. Showing the way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant wrap your mind around no matter how hard you try. Some folk take their children to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some to temples made of stone and some just look inside themselves for whatever truth they think might be there. Most just take what their mothers and fathers gave them like a hand me down coat. Others spit on the very notion that anything could be bigger than their own small world. A man might choose one way of believing then cast it off like snakeskin for another. Whatever path we take we're all searching for that thing that makes us whole. Looking for that light in the black that'll guide us home.\n\nMe and my father sat on the porch that day. Rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Both of us with cigarettes. The gutters running full and drowning out the flowers below. Cardinal, he said when I asked him what bird he liked best. He stared out into the rain like a man trying to remember something he'd lost. His clothes hung on him like a scarecrow's. His hair thin and patchy where it used to be thick. He wouldn't look at me and I couldn't speak of what was coming because speaking makes a thing real. I moved closer and hugged him and we both watched the rain fall in the failing light of that June evening.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors with their medicines and their machines bought him a few more months of suffering and I never could reckon the worth of that. What sort of God would do such a thing. I laid in the dark those nights. No prayers passed my lips. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI wouldn't watch him die. Couldn't. You cant watch the life that made you while it leaves this world. I wanted to keep him how he lived not how he died. I knew him better than any of them did. Better than his own kin. And I knew he wouldn't want his only child watching while death took him. So I curled up in my bed and waited three days for word.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "The man called Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his land and knew the worth of soil and seed and sovereignty. In those early days of the Republic he stood testament to the old ways, though he was no stranger to the halls of power where men spoke of governance and law. But it was the earth that shaped him and gave weight to his words about freedom and the rights of men to work their own ground.\n\nHe saw in this new country something that had never been before. A land unbound by the old ghosts of tradition. A place where men might govern themselves if they had the courage for it. He knew that rights were like bones in the body of liberty. Break one and the whole corpus fails. These things must remain beyond the reach of any government lest all be lost.\n\nThe world of nature he knew was red of tooth and claw where the strong preyed upon the weak but civilization could not abide such ways. He saw that government must account for the darkness in men's hearts while preserving what light remained. Good and evil moved through his thoughts like wind through winter wheat. As government is exercised by man all its virtues and vices must be human, he wrote, knowing the truth of it in his bones.\n\nHe believed good principles were those that protected what a man owned and worked for, that improved the tilling of soil, that stood against the moneyed interests who would make all men slaves to coin and paper. Self-interest drove all things but turned poisonous when it led men to feed upon their brothers.\n\nLike others who stood for the old Republic he held to the Constitution's words with iron certainty. The federal power must be bound and limited lest it grow fat and tyrannous on the people's bread. Yet he knew too that words alone were dangerous things without the spirit that gave them life. The Declaration was his true charter, for it spoke of sovereign states and not one nation bound in chains of power. He saw these truths as clear as he saw the furrows in his fields, and spoke them with the same certainty that seeds would sprout in spring.",
            "He stood there watching. The porcelain bowl white and cold beneath the fluorescent lights that hummed like distant wasps. His mind moved through the scene like water over stone, taking nothing with it, leaving nothing behind. Just the watching.\n\nHe remembered a book. Some woman had told him about it once, an artist woman who spoke of the right side of the brain and how to see what was real in the world. How to frame it. How to make it small enough to understand. But there wasnt any frame for this. No way to make it smaller or more comprehensible. It was what it was.\n\nThe brown mass lay there in the bottom of the bowl like some primitive creature pulled up from the depths of the earth. Like something that had no business in the world of men. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens but this was his color now. Brown. The color of endings. The color of what gets left behind.\n\nHis hand found the lever and pulled. Water swirled and moved like spirits in the bowl but the thing remained. Unmoved. Uncaring. He flushed again and watched the water rise and fall. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The green tie at his throat felt like a noose.\n\nHe stood with his feet set wide on the tiles. The mop beside him like some useless weapon. The paper rolled off the roll like bandages for some wound that wouldnt heal. Layer after layer wrapped around his hand until it was something else entirely. Not a hand anymore but a tool. A thing for doing what needed doing.\n\nWhen he reached into the bowl his arm moved slow and careful like a man reaching into the mouth of something that might wake up and bite. The water was cold. Everything was cold. The world was cold and this was what was left of it. This was what they paid him for. This was what men did.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers and charts but the dead care nothing for such things. The National Institute speaks of brains not ready, not formed, like wet clay not yet hardened in the kiln of years. But there is more to it than that. More darkness in the hearts of the young.\n\nHe watched them on the roads. Inexperienced. Raw. Their vehicles rolling and tumbling like dead leaves in an autumn wind. Speed demons chasing something they could not name. The asphalt calling to them like some dark siren song.\n\nThey travel in packs, these young ones. Like wolves. Studies done in the southern lands of California showed the truth of it. The more of them together, the more bones scattered on the roadside. States tried to cage them with paper laws. Provisional licenses. Time restrictions. But laws are just words on paper and the young have always held such things in contempt.\n\nThe psychologist Zuckerman knew. Even at eighteen the blood runs hot and wild. They seek the thrill like addicts seeking the needle. The rush of speed and danger coursing through their veins like some precious poison. He had seen it in their eyes. That hunger. That need.\n\nBy the year 2010 they would come in waves. The children of the boom times reaching driving age like some great migration. Millions of them. The roads would run red with their passing.\n\nThe solution lay in waiting. Let them learn in classrooms and simulators but keep them from the wheel until eighteen summers have passed. Let them practice under watchful eyes. Six hours behind the wheel. Fifty hours with an adult present. Like an apprenticeship to survival.\n\nThe law would need to be universal. Coast to coast. Border to border. One rule for all the young. It was not a new idea. Others had spoken it before. But sometimes old medicine is the strongest medicine. Sometimes the old ways are the only ways.\n\nHe thought of all the young ones yet to die. Their faces unknown but their fates already written in the cold equations of probability. Perhaps there was still time to save them. Perhaps. But time was like water in a cracked vessel. Running out. Always running out.",
            "The boy watched him scrawl upon the yellowed paper with a worn pencil stub. Words about the broken ones, them that cant hear right in their heads. Not deaf mind you but somethin worse. Like their brains was wrapped in cotton. Like God himself had reached down and pulled some wires loose just to see what might happen.\n\nHe wrote about them that studied it first. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. Back in fifty-four when the world was younger and less cruel. They'd sit with children broken in ways you couldn't see and they'd make their tests and write their findings in thick leather books now turned to ash somewhere.\n\nThe afflicted ones they'd tested couldn't place sounds in the world like normal folk. Couldn't tell which way a voice came from or pick one voice from many. Like trying to catch fish in muddy water with your bare hands. Some couldn't hear the difference tween a question and a threat, couldn't make sense of the simplest things said to them. Their brains betrayed them. Simple as that.\n\nThey got doctors now that'll test for it. Audiologists they call em. White coats and clipboards and machines that measure the echoes in your head. They'll sit you down and whisper numbers in your ears and make you repeat em back. They'll ask you questions about what you hear and don't hear and write it all down in their precise hand like scribes recording the words of prophets. But there aint no one test that'll tell you for certain. No machine that can look inside and point to the broken part and say here, here's your trouble. The cause remains a mystery, like most terrible things in this world.\n\nHe set down the pencil and studied what he'd written. Words marching across the page like soldiers heading to war. Each one carrying its own weight of meaning. Each one a testament to the ways we break and the ways we try to mend what's broken.",
            "The boy sat on the couch and his eyes were wild with fear like some trapped animal. He knew what was coming. They all did. The social work it called to me like a dark bell tolling in the night. Not then maybe but soon enough. The darkness in mens souls and the things they visit upon their children. I had seen it before. Would see it again.\n\nThe degree in psychology hanging on the wall like some talisman against the evil that men do. But it wasnt enough. Never was. The police they stood in the yard that day watching. Just watching. The parents in their hollow righteousness spouting words like manipulative and simple disputes but their eyes betrayed them. Evil has a look to it. You see it enough times you dont forget.\n\nI knew then what I had to become. A worker in the darkness. Someone to stand between the innocent and the void. The values burned in me like a flame. Service. Justice. Ethics. Words that mean nothing until they mean everything. Until they're all that stands between a child and the darkness that would swallow them whole.\n\nI had always been different. Hair the color of nuclear sunsets. Metal in my flesh like some tribal marking. A warrior for the different ones. The lost ones. The gay and the straight and all the spaces between. Fighting the old battles against hate and ignorance. These were my people. The ones society wanted to make invisible.\n\nThe social work it calls to you like a siren song. Like something ancient and true. You either hear it or you dont. And if you hear it you cant unhear it. It becomes the thing that drives you. The thing that wakes you in the night. Because out there in the darkness children are crying and someone has to answer. Someone has to stand in the doorway between innocence and evil and say no further. This far and no further.\n\nAnd that's what I aim to do. To stand in that doorway until they plant me in the ground. Because evil never sleeps and the innocent need their warriors. Their protectors. Their workers in the social dark.",
            "The dark shapes of sleep and wakefulness move through us like spirits in the night. They come unbidden and go as they please and we are powerless against their ministrations. In the laboratory they keep mice in small metal cages and study how sleep comes to them or doesnt. The scientists speak of things called neurons firing in the hypothalamus, orexin coursing through the brain like some biblical flood. They speak of receptors called GABAB as if naming old testament prophets. These receptors they say govern the coming of sleep and its going.\n\nThe mice they study are not unlike us in their need for rest. Their small hearts beating in the dark of their cages while the white-coated priests of science watch and make their marks in leather-bound books. They speak of something called baclofen that makes the mice sleep longer and deeper. As if sleep itself could be caught and measured and weighed like grain.\n\nThere are those among us who cannot sleep. Who lie awake in the vast darkness while the world turns beneath them. Their genes carry some ancient curse passed down through blood and bone from father to son and mother to daughter. The absence of proper receptors in their brains leaving them to wander the midnight hours like restless ghosts. \n\nThe scientists say their research with the mice can tell us about ourselves. About why some can sleep and others cannot. About how this failure of sleep moves through families like some dark inheritance. How it destroys lives as surely as any plague - taking first the ability to work, then to think, then finally the will to go on living in a world without rest.\n\nThey keep their mice in metal cages and study them and make their marks in books but the truth of sleep remains mysterious as death. The neurons fire or they dont. The receptors work or they fail. And in the end we are all at the mercy of forces we barely understand, forces as old as the darkness itself.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like water through a sieve. Dark mornings walking east from Stuart Hall where they'd put me that first year, far out on the edge of things where the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray sky. Twenty-five minutes by foot to Willard if the weather held. Weather rarely held. Some old timer told me bout how it was before. Said East Halls stood alone out there like some outpost, nothin but empty land between. Not anymore. Sports fields now. New buildings risen up like concrete monuments. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment blocks crowding round like mourners at a wake. Campus growing like some living thing, reaching out across the valley floor. Distance growing with it.\n\nBicycle's the answer. Simple as that. But answers aint worth nothing without action behind em. Need riders. Need paths. Need the whole damn thing built right.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever quit. Said bikes was the only true way. Bowl of oatmeal'll take you thirty miles if you're willing. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best thing I ever done. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minutes walking. Five minutes riding if you pump hard enough. Pollock Road runs straight as an arrow but it aint friendly. Like some river of humanity flowing both ways, everyone in their own world, everyone moving like the world's about to end.\n\nWalking's good for the soul maybe but time aint kind. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight. Thirty minutes extra each way to Thomas. Two and a half hours gone each week like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's precious out here. Time's all we got.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words again. Words about a world that never was but might yet be. The book lay heavy in his hands like some ancient tome speaking prophecies of darkness. Brave New World they called it. Weren't nothing brave about it though.\n\nThe world in them pages was a cold one. Clinical. Everything measured out in droppers and test tubes, life itself parsed and portioned like medicine. Community they called it but it weren't no community he'd ever known. Just people moving like machines, thinking thoughts put there by others. The Controller watching over it all like some dark god in his high tower.\n\nMarx had seen it coming maybe. That old prophet of the working man speaking through time about false consciousness and hegemony. Big words for simple truths. The truth that men could be made to love their chains if you gilded them proper. In that brave new world they'd done just that, made folk happy to be slaves. Deltas and Gammas and all manner of greek-lettered souls moving through their days like sleepwalkers, dreaming dreams fed to them in the dark while they slept.\n\nWeren't no real love in that world. No passion neither. Just bodies moving against bodies, mechanical-like. Men speaking of women like they was talking about the weather, clinical words about pneumatic this and pneumatic that. Women too, talking about their couplings like they was discussing what they had for breakfast. All of it hollow. Empty as a dead man's eyes.\n\nHe thought about them social classes, stacked up like cord wood. Each one content in their place cause they'd been told to be content. Consuming and obeying and never questioning why. The upper classes watching it all, knowing maybe but not caring. All of them caught in the same machine, just different gears turning different ways.\n\nThe whole thing speaking to something deeper. Something about how men lose their souls when machines and money become their gods. How technology and capitalism together could strip a man down to nothing but wants and needs, all manufactured proper-like by them that knew how. A warning maybe, written in ink but speaking in blood.\n\nHe closed the book. Outside the wind moved through dead trees, whispering secrets to no one at all.",
            "The class on Islam came to me four winters past at CBC, dark thoughts weighing on minds like storm clouds. They spoke of hostility in the faith, voices rising and falling like wind through dead grass. The question hangs heavier now than it did then, like a noose waiting for its neck.\n\nI watched how the papers and screens changed their telling after the towers fell. First came the rage, hot and blind as wildfire. Then something else. A kind of forced kindness, stretched thin as spiderweb. Strange days these are when a man called Obama, carrying Muslim blood in his veins, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me. The words dont match the deeds, like footprints leading two ways. They say he was gentle but history speaks otherwise. I seen how he took the tribes, one after another, blade first then faith following. Yet here in these pages they paint him soft as lamplight, a martyr walking through sand and time, people following him like lost sheep finding water.\n\nThey wrote him performing works that mirror the Christ's own doing. Took meat and milk and made it more, feeding forty men till they could eat no more. These words feel hollow, like bones picked clean. They wanted him holy, needed him holy, but the truth is a different beast altogether. It's a theft of sacred things, taking Christ's glory and draping it over their own prophet like a borrowed cloak.\n\nThe stories come third-hand or worse, passed mouth to mouth like desert gossip. Someone heard from someone who heard from another, on and on till truth gets lost in the telling. They meant it for proof but it reads like smoke, nothing solid to grasp.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they made him gentle when gentleness wasnt in him. They wrote of wisdom and humility but the blood tells different. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true shape of the man they follow, or if they too are lost in the stories, believing what they need to believe.",
            "The truth of the Christ and what he spoke in his time was lost quick as breath in winter, scattered to winds that carried new thoughts across the land after his passing. Like tracks in ash swept clean. Looking back across the years you could see how the teaching got further and further from where it started, like a man walking away from his home till he cant see it no more behind him. These days theres a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasnt there before. The old ones still cling to what their fathers told them but they grow fewer, like trees in a burned forest.\n\nThe Christians that remain will come to see what was lost. Theyll hunger for it like men dying of thirst. Theyll want to peel back the layers of words men put over the words of God like paint over paint until they find what was first written there. Maybe it'll take a hundred years. Maybe more. But it'll come sure as winter follows fall. They'll strip it down piece by piece, like taking apart an old house board by board till nothing stands but the foundation that Jesus himself laid down. When this thing sweeps through the old countries itll carry people with it like leaves in a river. The church will still stand but itll be different. Simpler. More like it was.\n\nWhere once there were a thousand different ways to worship therell be just one. Like streams joining to make a river. The differences between men will wash away like footprints in rain. History's got a way of turning back on itself, like a snake eating its own tail. Time was when Romans killed Christians in the streets but then Rome itself knelt down before the cross. This country once kept men in chains and now those same men's sons sit in high places. The wheel keeps turning.\n\nThey'll read his words different too. Not like reading a map but like reading poetry. Looking for the truth behind the words instead of in them. To understand how we got here you got to go back. Back before there was any such thing as Christian. Back when there was only the old religion of the Jews. They believed in one God and holy books and divine revelation. But even then they were split five ways - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and the common folk who followed none of these. Each claiming they knew the truth of things.",
            "They was greedy folk them owners and managers and they knew it deep in their guts but they didnt care none. The factories rose up like great black mountains against the sky and the smoke poured forth like rivers of death flowing to the ends of the earth. Aint no man ever looked down from them heights and saw anything worth saving below. The workers was just numbers to them. Numbers on paper written in ink black as their hearts.\n\nThe place they called Packingtown was a hellhole of suffering where men and women worked themselves to bone and marrow for scraps while the bosses grew fat on their misery. Loyalty was a word that held no meaning there. Everything had its price and a man's worth was measured in dollars and cents. The owners would sooner see a worker dead than spend a penny more than they had to. That was the truth of it plain and cold as winter.\n\nThe smoke rolled thick and black across the sky and the stench of death and rot hung in the air like a curse. Animal waste ran in rivers through the streets mixing with the blood and the filth. But them that owned the place they just watched from their offices high above counting their money while below the people suffered and died.\n\nWasnt no laws to protect them workers back then. No safety regulations nor nothing to keep the owners from working them till they dropped dead on the killing floors. The unions that come along they was just as bad. Vultures picking at the bones of them that was already half dead from the work. Most of them workers was foreigners desperate for any kind of work and the owners knew it. Used it against them like a whip.\n\nThey was slaves in all but name. Living on the edge of starvation day after day dependent on the mercy of men who had none to give. The morality of such a place was like everything else there corrupted and diseased. The whole system was rotten through and through like meat left too long in the sun. And there wasnt no escape from it neither. Not for them that was caught in its grip.",
            "The darkness lay over Dreamland like a shroud, black and ancient as time itself. In those pages Poe had writ the word Thulé, scratched it there twice as though marking the borders of some forsaken realm. The word itself carried echoes of Virgil's voice across the centuries, speaking of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the Greeks had drawn their maps to end in mist and legend.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten into Poe's blood like a fever. Their words moved through him like dark water through deep caves.\n\nThere was Goethe. His Faust stood like a monument, carved in two great pieces across the years - first in 1808 and again in 1832 when death finally took him. Within those pages lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed beyond the veil, leaving him nothing but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep from both until neither could sustain him. When the end came he gave away his kingdom like a man shrugging off a heavy coat, keeping only that cup, that last token of love. Then he walked out onto the cliffs above the sea, black water moving below. The goblet caught the light one final time before he cast it into the depths. Then he closed his eyes and followed it into darkness.\n\nThe shade of that tale fell across Poe's \"Dream-Land\" like an evening shadow. He wrote of Thule twice, bookending his verses with that ancient word as though to mark the borders of that desolate realm. His speaker wandered landscapes stripped of color, haunted by the ghosts of dead companions, moving through a world as empty as the one Goethe's king had left behind.\n\nThe connection ran deeper than chance. Poe knew Goethe's work - how could he not? It moved through the literary world like blood through veins. When they spoke of Tennyson, Poe would nod, knowing the threads that bound them all together across the dark waters of influence and time. The reproductions of Goethe's work spread like ripples in still water, touching everything. Even Grattan had shaped Faust anew in 1842, barely a year before Poe set down \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" with its own whispered mention of ultima Thule.",
            "They'd tell stories later about that day at D&D Markets. About the applesauce that lay there like some pale viscous blood upon the floor and how Martin sat in his office eating while fate worked its slow arithmetic in the aisles beyond. The spill had come at five. Wayne had seen it first. Told Martin who sat there behind his desk with his dinner laid out before him like some pagan offering to darker gods. Didn't have time for customer complaints he'd said. His voice flat and dead as winter.\n\nFifteen minutes passed and Haddigan came. She too bore witness to the creeping danger in aisle four but Martin would not be moved. He sat immobile as stone while time crept past like a thief in the night. Half past five Palmer came. She never saw what took her feet from under her. Never saw the applesauce gleaming dull and treacherous in the fluorescent light. Her back broke bad and she fell into darkness deeper than any night.\n\nThe law spoke of malice and oppression and fraud. Spoke of despicable acts committed with willful disregard. Six souls had fallen in those aisles that year alone. Six victims to negligence and indifference cold as the tile floor itself. The judges knew such things. Had seen them written in blood and broken bones across the years. Taylor's case spoke of dangerous consequences known but not heeded. Of willful failure to act when action might have saved.\n\nMartin knew. He knew and still he sat. Still he ate while danger waited patient as a rattler in the aisles. The law would not look kindly on such things. Would not shield him from the punishment such calculated indifference called forth. Palmer's claim would stand. The courts would hear her tale of woe and pain. Of a manager who chose his dinner over duty. Who let peril stalk his store while he supped in safety.\n\nThe law was clear as morning. Clear as the applesauce that lay there waiting. Punitive damages would come like judgment day. No summary dismissal would save them now. The facts lay bare as bones and twice as damning. They would pay in coin and conscience both.",
            "The wanting had come early. Like a shadow that follows but never catches up. Started when she was fourteen and lingered still at seventeen, a ghost of need that wouldnt rest. Not a thing she needed no. A someone. But the boys that came didnt matter none. They'd circle like crows round a dying thing, awkward in their courtship, but she felt nothing for them. Nothing at all. She'd lay awake studying the ceiling, questioning what darkness lived inside her that made her this way. Years passed like that. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet mostly. Her folks were peaceful folk who rarely raised their voices, save when their daughter's wild spirit crashed against their stillness like waves on stone. She was their opposite, full of life and light that drew others to her like moths to flame. Good hearted too. Kind.\n\nBut this day wasnt quiet. No. This day carried something else. She wandered room to room searching for something she couldn't name when her mother's scream cut through the silence like broken glass. Kitchen. She ran. Found her mother laid out on the tile floor, face twisted in pain, breath coming short and sharp.\n\nMama what's wrong? She knelt beside her mother who could barely speak through the hurt. Hospital, her mother managed. Just take me there.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up, thankful for the strength in her arms from all them classes she'd taken. Carried her to the car and laid her in the back like something precious and broken. Drove fast through streets gone colorless with worry.\n\nThe hospital reeked of death and cleaning fluid but she noticed none of it. Just carried her mother through them sliding doors calling for help until white-coated figures appeared like ghosts from the fluorescent haze. They took her mother away on a wheeled bed and left the girl alone with her fear.\n\nLater they told her. Her mother had been reaching for some old vase, balanced on a stepstool like a bird on a wire. Then gravity remembered her and brought her down hard to the unforgiving earth.",
            "They watched them dying year by year. Hearts giving out like old clockwork, blood vessels clogged and useless. The nurses knew. They'd seen it before and they'd see it again. Seventy four thousand of them watching and waiting and marking their charts with what they ate and what they didn't. Mediterranean style they called it. Plants and fish and oils pressed from ancient trees. No meat to speak of. Like them old desert people used to eat before the world went wrong.\n\nThe women they studied weren't sick yet. Not with the sugar disease nor the heart troubles. Thirty eight to sixty three years old they was. Every few years they'd write down what passed their lips. Everything catalogued like a church inventory. Two decades of eating and dying. Some quit the study but most stayed on. Faithful as converts to some old religion.\n\nThe doctors checked every death. Every seized-up heart, every blood vessel burst in the brain. They'd look at papers and records and death certificates like archaeological artifacts. Sometimes there weren't no records to speak of. They called them probable cases and counted them anyway. Seventeen percent of the strokes. Twenty four percent of the heart attacks that didn't kill.\n\nThey kept track of everything. Weight and smoking and pills they took. Whether their monthly blood still came or if it had stopped. Whether they moved their bodies or just sat still. Like bookkeepers tallying up the accounts of lives lived and lost.\n\nThey used numbers to wash away the noise. Averaged everything together like mixing paint. Tried to account for things that might lead them astray. Age and smoking and all them other habits that kill.\n\nAfter twenty years they had their answer written in blood and death. Two thousand heart attacks. Near eighteen hundred strokes. Over a thousand dead from their hearts or their heads giving out. But them that ate like them old Mediterranean people, they lived longer. Twenty nine percent longer than them that didn't. Like some old testament prophecy come true in hospital corridors and nursing stations. Eat of these foods and live. Eat of the others and die.",
            "The sign said Hitler lives in Burma and the girl held it there above her head in the gray morning light. The cardboard bent and weathered like something pulled from an ancient tomb. Standing alone on that corner like a prophet of old. The country they called Burma once and Myanmar now lay far across waters dark and deep where men in uniforms ruled with iron and blood since before most could remember. The military junta they called them. Words that meant nothing to the dead.\n\nIn the year two thousand and seven the monks rose up. Orange robed like flames against the concrete and steel of the cities. The Saffron Revolution they named it but revolutions aint got much to do with spices and this one was no different. At first the government let them march. Let them gather. Then the violence came as it always does. Ancient monasteries ransacked and burning. Journalists rounded up or shot dead in the streets. One Japanese man named Nagai caught it there on the concrete while his camera kept rolling til the end.\n\nThey said thirteen dead but a colonel who fled told different stories. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the thousands. The government denied it as governments do. Ancient as time itself this need to rule. To stamp out the light wherever it shows. Roman emperors who called themselves gods. Japanese kings descended from heaven itself. Our own president taking counsel from prophets and madmen every seventh day.\n\nIn China they gunned down students in the streets of Tiananmen. The numbers changed depending on who did the counting but the dead stayed dead all the same. In Rwanda the Hutus killed their Tutsi neighbors with machetes and clubs til the streets ran red. And before all that there was Hitler. The girl with the sign knew. Knew how these things went. How they always went. Evil didnt die. It just moved on down the road looking for new places to root.",
            "The old jazzman's shadow stretched long across them decades like some dark thing that wouldnt die. Piano keys worn smooth by time and the endless nights. He didnt play much but when he did it was like rainwater falling soft on tin. His real power lay in knowing the souls of them that played for him. Each one carrying their own particular sound like a birthmark or a scar. He wrote the music but it wasnt just notes on paper. It was blood and breath.\n\nThe book men talk about something called Creole Love Call like it was just another piece of music but it wasnt. Voice rising up out of nowhere like some lost spirit crying in the dark. No words. No words needed. Just pure sound floating above them reeds like smoke. Blues wrapped around blues wrapped around blues six times over.\n\nFirst the voice comes pure as morning then turns rough like somebody dragged it through gravel. Then that trumpet crying through the mute like it knows something about suffering. Clarinet floating high and lonesome while the piano whispers underneath. Then the whole band takes up the cry, brass and reeds calling back and forth like wolves in the night. Fifth time through everything rises up fierce and wild, them reeds screaming high while brass and rhythm punch holes in the dark below. Last time voice comes back growling like some creature that aint human no more. At the end just a run of notes and that trombone laughing bitter and wrong.\n\nYear later he done Hot and Bothered. Miley on trumpet and Cox singing sounds that wasnt words, just pure music. Like they was having some kind of conversation that normal folks couldnt understand. Then that piece about swing, Nanton making that trombone talk like it had a human tongue. Playing sounds that wasnt never meant to come from brass and metal.\n\nThat was his gift. Taking human sounds and making them mechanical. Taking machine sounds and making them human. Mixing them all up till you couldnt tell which was which no more. Like some kind of dark alchemy. Like he knew something about music that wasnt in no books nowhere.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraling through time and space like some cosmic dance frozen in calcium. The old man Thompson had said it back in 1917 that no man could speak the language of these forms in numbers and equations and even now a hundred years hence they still could not. Not really.\n\nThe shells lay before him on the wooden table. Prunum specimens collected from waters he'd never see. Each one a record of life and death and the slow accretion of being. Mathematical models could tell you something of their growing but not everything. Never everything. They'd X-rayed them, fed numbers into machines called CerioShell that spat out predictions of what could be and what couldn't. As if the world needed telling.\n\nThe shell was a house built by its tenant, spiral upon spiral like the chambers of some infinite heart. Whorls, they called them. Each one marking time like rings in a tree, each one pressed against an axis running through the center that men had named columella though God knows what the creature called it. If it called it anything at all. The last chamber always the largest, like the final breath of a dying thing. They had names for every part. Apex and base and aperture. Words to cage the mystery but never quite holding it.\n\nYou could turn them this way and that. View them from above or below or straight on but they kept their secrets. Counting the whorls was like counting the years of the dead. Draw a line and start where the first suture begins, marking quarter turns like the phases of some calcium moon.\n\nThe path of growth could be tracked. Numbers assigned to the spacing and the width and the height as if that could capture the essence of the thing. As if mathematics could explain the why of it all. But the numbers were just shadows on the cave wall, telling nothing of the thing itself. Of what drove it to build in curves and spirals, to leave these empty houses scattered on the shores of time.\n\nHe touched one shell with a finger. Smooth and cold. Wondering what compulsion had driven its maker through the dark waters, adding layer upon layer in the blind faith that this was what it must do. This was its purpose. This was its being. Mathematical models could predict the possible but never the necessary. Never the why of it all.",
            "He studied the numbers before him, cold figures that spoke of death in the far reaches of those islands. Ten years and nothing changed. Children dying same as they always had. Mothers too. The government men had their goals written in fine ink on clean paper but the truth was darker, more brutal than their neat columns could tell.\n\nIn the cities now you might find someone who knew the way of birth. Seventy-two out of hundred they said. But these weren't doctors with their clean hands and sharp tools. Just women who'd seen enough blood to know its ways. When the bleeding started they had nothing but old ways and prayers. He'd seen it. The dark blood flowing like river water in the night.\n\nThe children still died of the flux, their small bodies wracked with it. Less help now than before. The numbers told that truth plain enough. In the towns where the roads were paved you might find a doctor to cut the baby free. Seven in hundred. But in the places where the dirt was still dirt and men lived close to the bone it was two. Just two. The math was simple as a knife.\n\nRich folk got their care. Poor folk died. Twenty-seven percent difference they called it. He called it blood money. Called it the price of being born wrong.\n\nThey talked about programs now. Special ways to fix special problems. But he knew better. Knew you couldn't patch a rotting house board by board. The whole thing needed tearing down, building new from foundation up. They'd tried it before with the plague that took men's blood. Threw money at it like water on a fire. But the fire just moved elsewhere, burned through the family planning houses instead. That's how money worked. Like water finding the low ground.\n\nThe papers piled up on desks. Forms in triplicate. Programs layered on programs like old paint, each one hiding the rot beneath. But the children still died. The mothers still bled. And the numbers stayed cold as stones.",
            "The music they called Popular had grown and spread like some dark vine across the century past, spawning genres uncountable, each one birthing more in its wake. They had names for them all. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk but these were just words men had given to something that defied naming. And from these came others still, subspecies breeding in the dark corners of sound until they became something else entirely.\n\nAmong these bastard children was one they called Heavy Metal. It came forth some forty years ago and grew like something feral, something that refused to be contained. It spoke in tongues of darkness and carried within it emotions raw and terrible as birth. Men saw in it something malleable, something that could be shaped and reformed endless times, and so they did.\n\nNow the thing has grown so vast and strange that none can say what it truly is anymore. It feeds on other sounds, other genres, consuming them and making them its own. To understand this thing you must go back to its beginning, to the dark soil from which it grew. For this aint no mere category of sound. This is something that moves through the world like a fever through the blood.\n\nThe darkness lies at its core like a black seed. Everything about it demands more. More thunder in the bass, more volume to shatter eardrums, more violence in its execution. The players themselves became technicians of sound, masters of their craft in ways the old musicians never were. And always there were the drugs, flowing through the veins of the seventies like poison, making men create sounds that weren't of this earth. They used these chemicals like shamans use their herbs, to touch something beyond the veil of reality.\n\nIt carried within it something visceral, something that hadn't existed in the popular sounds that came before. It reached back to the dark romanticism of another age, pulling forth themes of death and decay and loss. Even the Beatles, those prophets of love and light, found themselves drawn to its power. They wrote Helter Skelter like men possessed, trying to outdo the Stones in their descent into the maelstrom. That song stands now like a marker, a sign pointing toward the darkness to come.",
            "In the time before the dreamers took to their canvases with their wild visions, there was Rousseau. He who held his brushes like ancient tools of some forgotten ceremony. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, this fever vision of woman and jungle and night. She lay there midst the dark fronds and violet blooms, pale as bone china in the spectral light, while all round her the jungle breathed and watched with golden eyes.\n\nHe'd come to painting late, had Rousseau. No schooling in the arts save what the world had writ upon his heart. Born to a tinsmith in Laval where the gray streets wound down to the river and the sounds of hammering rang out across the morning fog. For forty years he collected tolls, counted coins, watched faces pass. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. A counter of small coins. A keeper of minor gates.\n\nGrief walked with him like a shadow. Eight children born dead or dying. His wife Clémence taken too, leaving him with only Julia, this one daughter like a single candle burning in a vast and darkened room. And so he turned to paint and canvas like a man turns to prayer, seeking something that might fill the emptiness.\n\nHe worked in silence while around him others rose to fame. Matisse with his wild colors burning holes in canvas. But Rousseau, he painted slow and careful like a man trying to remember something seen in dreams. Some said he wanted only to be accepted, to make the kind of paintings that would open doors. But in his heart he knew. The jungle waited. The dreams came calling. And he answered them with brush and paint, making worlds that never were but somehow always had been.\n\nThe critics laughed. The galleries turned away. But still he painted on, each stroke a defiance, each canvas a door opened onto somewhere else. Somewhere in the dark beyond the firelight where the dreams still walked upright and spoke in tongues of flame and shadow.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them great minds what spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Something in that notion rang true deep down in the marrow of things. Old Keats had wrote it plain as day in his poem bout that old urn, said beauty and truth was one and the same and that was all any man needed knowing in this world. Most things a man learns comes from books or hard living but these things, the knowing of what's right and what's beautiful, they come to a man different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe remembered studying them paintings in museums, folk talking bout foreground and background and such, trying to pin down why something like that Mona Lisa woman spoke to the soul. But words failed. Always failed. People'd look at some painting or read some book that moved em and they'd say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Truth was you couldn't never capture it complete. That O'Connor woman knew it, said some things could only be told in stories cause regular words wouldn't do.\n\nThe boy looked up at him. What are you thinking about Papa?\n\nAbout truth and beauty son. About how they're like ghosts you can feel but cant never quite catch hold of.\n\nLike God?\n\nMaybe so. Maybe just so.\n\nHe thought on how both goodness and beauty worked on a man's soul in ways that couldn't be spoke proper. Like they was both reaching down from some higher place, touching something deep inside that was beyond telling. Them books he'd read talked about noumenal things, things that could be felt but not explained. That's what it was like. The knowing of right from wrong and the knowing of beauty, they was kin somehow. Connected in that deep place where words don't go.\n\nEspecially in them stories folk wrote. McKean had it right when he said stories was different from other arts cause they carried the weight of living in em. Values and such. The choosing between right and wrong. Just like real life only distilled down somehow. Pure. Like truth and beauty was just different words for the same thing after all.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold from the teeth of the alps down to where the Baltic meets the shore at Kiel, a place where men speak in low voices and the wind carries salt. This is Germany. The same blood runs through the veins of those who dwell by the Rhine at Köln as those who wake in Dresden where the Elbe cuts through stone like an ancient knife. The people carry something in them older than memory. Something that came before.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself is lost to time like footprints in ash, disputed by learned men who speak in whispers through dusty tomes. Tacitus, dead these thousand years, wrote of the Tungrians who crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar too spoke of them. Called them Germanus in his writings of the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls like dogs but could not tame those who dwelt beyond the river. He took the word from the Gauls themselves, though what it meant none now living can say. Some claim it spoke of neighbors. Others say it named the spears they carried, dark instruments of death called ger, or maybe it came from garim, an old Irish word for shouting, for these were a people who made the very air tremble with their voices.\n\nTacitus wrote more. In 98 he put down words about these people, claiming they were pure as winter snow, unmixed with the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild country with its bitter sky and darker ways? Who indeed would leave warm southern lands for this place unless it was already branded on their soul?\n\nThe Romans would not. They sent their legions north for plunder and glory but always they returned south like birds in autumn, back to their marble halls and heated baths. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of this empire of stone and law, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in the ranks of armies not their own. They were there in the middle of that first century, watching, waiting, their destiny as yet unwritten in the book of days.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some vast tapestry of deception, each thread woven through with lies that must someday unravel or else consume the weaver whole. They'd called it Twelfth Night though it mightve been called anything. A story of masks and faces beneath masks and the terrible price of wearing either too long.\n\nThe girl Viola comes to strange shores. Comes walking out of the sea like some halfdrowned thing. She takes a mans clothes and a mans name as if such things could be borrowed like coins. Protection she called it. As if cloth and leather could ward off the worlds malice. But the disguise that saves can also damn and she found herself cut off from the women who mightve been sisters to her. Cast adrift in a wilderness of her own making.\n\nThe noble Olivia sees this false man Cesario and something burns in her that maybe shouldnt burn. Who can say if what she saw was the man that wasnt there or the woman beneath. She speaks the words husband stay and the echo of them hangs in the air like smoke. Even Orsino who thought himself immune to such confusion finds his heart speaking in strange tongues. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times. As if repetition could make the lie more true.\n\nThese people move through their world like sleepwalkers. Each one carrying some secret flame. Some hidden truth they dare not name. The disguise becomes a mirror and in it they see what they fear to see. What they hope to see. What was there all along.\n\nWhen the truth finally comes it comes like rain after drought. Washing away the masks. The pretense. Olivia finds her heart can shift like quicksilver from Cesario to Sebastian. As if love were nothing but a trick of light. A sister you are she, she says to Viola. As if family could be claimed as easily as changing clothes. But blood knows blood and perhaps in the end that's all that matters.\n\nIn this world of shadows and mirrors perhaps there are no true faces. Only the ones we choose to wear and the ones we're born with and sometimes you cant tell one from the other. The deception that saves can also destroy and in the end each must choose which truth to embrace and which to let slip away into the darkness like a dream half-remembered.",
            "He'd seen it in the books. German rule and what it brung. The Herero dead and the Nama too and the bones bleached white in that hard African sun. But you couldn't say it was all one thing or another. Nothing ever was.\n\nIn the east they'd found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like they'd been born to it. The British come in 1919 and there they were. In Kamerun too they'd done some good if you could call it that. If you could call any of it good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. A hard land. Cruel. Like it had been born mean and stayed that way. No government schools there. Just missionaries working with what little they had which wasnt much. White children got their learning though. Got it good and proper with government money behind it. These things lasted. After the Germans were gone most blacks still couldn't read nor write nor cipher. Couldn't do none of it.\n\nHe studied the old papers. German mostly. Yellowed and crisp like dead leaves. Early writings just telling how things was. Later ones in English trying to make sense of it all. Compare this place to that place. Why things was different here than there. Cohen wrote on it. Said it was the settlers made it what it was.\n\nThe weather wasn't so bad in South West Africa. Not good neither but a man could live there if he had to. By 1913 fifteen thousand whites had come. More than anywhere else in German Africa. East Africa only had five thousand and some. Like they knew something. Like they could smell what was coming.\n\nThe land stretched out before him raw and empty. Desert mostly. The kind of place where a man's dreams die slow and hard. Where the past aint never really past and the future's just more of the same. Where education was just another way of saying who was gonna make it and who wasn't. Who was gonna live and who was gonna die.",
            "They stood there, the two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide of dust and blood. Fifty-seven years they watched and waited, from 1836 to 1893, marking time in the language of war and bitter memory. The war came in '46, when American boots ground Mexican earth beneath them and claimed Texas and the Southwest territories like a wolf claims the throat of its prey.\n\nThe hatred ran deep as a river cut through stone. Catholic and Protestant, Spanish and English blood, each carrying the old world's poison in their veins. The border between them was a wound that wouldn't heal, leaking bandits and desperados like pus from an infection. Seventeen times they clashed, counting the moments between like a man counts the seconds before a hanging.\n\nThe border towns lay scattered like broken teeth along a jawline of desert. Raiders crossed back and forth, ghosts in the scorched earth carrying death in their saddlebags. Military men from both sides walked the line with iron in their hands and steel in their eyes, but the blood kept flowing like water in a dry creek after rain.\n\nThe rivalry was born in difference, in the way men look at God through different windows and see different shapes in the darkness. Americans feared the Catholic cross like they later feared the hammer and sickle, their Protestant hearts hardened against the old Spanish ways. These fears were carried across oceans in the holds of ships, passed down like dark heirlooms from England and Spain.\n\nBut time changes all things. Mexico grew dependent on American gold like a plant bends toward the sun. American eyes turned from land to money, from conquest to commerce. The old hatred didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledger books instead of bodies.\n\nThey were like all border nations, these two. Locked together in a dance of blood and suspicion, until the music changed and they found new steps to follow. Only Mexico and Cuba, they said, only these caused such trouble in American minds, such persistent shadows in American dreams. The others, those further south, they kept their distance and their peace, watching from afar as the great beasts circled each other in their ancient ritual of rivalry and need.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness come. Never knew such a thing existed till it laid me flat. Was workin as a nurse then. Chose that path cause I needed something solid and sure, something I never had growing up. They kept telling me people would always need tending to, always get sick. So I turned away from what I wanted - to be writing about science and such - and took up nursing instead.\n\nThere I was. Forty-six years lived and alone. No money stored away and couldn't work no more. Still can't. After fifteen years living off government checks ain't got nothing to call mine anymore. Each day's a battle against the void, eating away at what little security remained. Nothing certain now except one truth that stands like bedrock: couldn't have made it without my people - family and them few friends that stuck. When disaster comes it strips you bare of any notion of strength you thought you had.\n\nFact is there'll always be trouble coming. Big or small, don't matter how ready you think you are. Some things just too vast to weather alone. Like them pioneers crossing the mountains west. Wasn't no rugged individual made it alone - was people helping people, sharing what little they had. Respect and mercy, that's what got them through.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't the truth of it. This country wasn't built on going it alone. Was built on people knowing their neighbors, helping when help was needed.\n\nGot my emergency supplies like anyone should. Water tablets and plastic sheeting. Duct tape for the windows case something biological comes. Flashlights and batteries and matches that'll light in the rain. Canned goods too. If you got land, work it. Put up food for winter. Get yourself a wood stove if you ain't living in them stacked-up boxes in town.\n\nBut while you're doing all that surviving, know your people. Know your neighbors. Cause when the real darkness comes, ain't no one makes it alone.",
            "He was born in the old world, a prince they say, five hundred years before the carpenter. They would call him Buddha. He walked away from his palace and his wealth and found something else entirely. Found enlightenment they called it. His words spread like wildfire through the east and became something else. Something called Buddhism. The Theravada they named it. Pure. Orthodox. Ancient.\n\nTwenty five hundred years gone now. Time changes all things. Even the words of gods. You can see it in Sri Lanka where they cut the waters each year like some ritual older than memory. Monks in their robes. Common folk too. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down into the bones of belief itself. The sangha brotherhood and the folk who follow them have watched their teachings shift like sand in wind. Some changes came from within their walls some from without. Some meant harm. Some meant nothing at all.\n\nWords mean things here. Internal is what comes from their own. External what comes from strangers. Hostile means to harm. To break. To unmake what Buddha built. Benign means no harm intended though harm might come all the same. These words will walk with us through this tale.\n\nFirst you must know what lies at the heart. They seek refuge in three things. Buddha. Dhamma. Sangha. The Dhamma lives in three baskets of ancient text. Suttas that tell the tales. Vinaya that makes the rules. Abhidhamma that speaks of what lies beyond the veil of flesh. They speak of Anatta - that no soul exists. Of Dukkha - that life is suffering. Of Anicca - that nothing lasts. Only by knowing these truths can one break free of the wheel. The endless cycle of death and birth they call Sansara. When it breaks so too breaks desire and hatred and the fog of delusion that clouds mens minds.\n\nThe Vinaya speaks of how to live. Five rules for common folk. Dont kill. Dont lie. Dont steal. Keep your loins in check. Stay clear of drink and smoke that clouds the mind. Monks have more chains to wear. But at the heart of it all lie four noble truths. First that life is suffering. Second that wanting makes us suffer. Third that suffering can end."
