            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The burrowing owl watched from its underground cathedral, its future uncertain as all futures must be.\n\nBefore the ranchers came with their cattle and their axes, before they felled the trees for cordwood, the Indians had walked these hills. Their ghosts still moved through the oak shadows, their footsteps quiet as falling leaves. The homesteaders came after, their patent on the land a piece of paper that meant everything and nothing. They grazed their cattle and cut their wood and were in turn forgotten.\n\nHe studied the property listings like a man reading auguries, searching for signs in the government programs that might make such a venture possible. Somewhere nearby another farm had found this balance, this covenant between profit and preservation. He thought perhaps he could do the same, though the path was dark and the outcome uncertain as all things must be in this world.",
            "Brothers carry bonds that run deeper than blood. Deep as stone. Deep as time itself. They look upon each other and see not just flesh and bone but mirrors of themselves, reflections cast back through the dark waters of time. In these waters swim love and pride and cruelty and things without names, ancient things that have no words in any tongue of man.\n\nThe boy called Doodle came into this world broke and bent, his heart weak as a sparrow's. His brother watched him, studied him like some strange creature pulled from the depths, wondering if he'd draw breath come morning. Some nights he'd stand over the cradle thinking dark thoughts, his small hands hovering above the pillow like pale spiders. But then Doodle smiled and something in his brother's heart cracked open like an egg.\n\nPride's a terrible thing. It burns in the blood like poison. The brother had dreamed of someone to race through the pinewoods, to climb the old vines that hung like gallows rope in Woman Swamp, to swim the black waters of Horsehead Landing. But Doodle could barely crawl. Could barely stand. His legs thin as twigs, his chest rising and falling with each labored breath.\n\nThey moved through that green country like pilgrims in some ancient fable. The brother leading, Doodle following, their footprints marking the red clay like stigmata. Above them the pines stood sentinel, their branches reaching toward a sky gone gray as gunmetal. The ibis came later, red as blood, red as sin, falling from that same sky like some divine omen. But by then it was too late. Pride had done its work. The storm had come. And in its wake only one brother remained to tell the tale.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing simple. It works in ways we cannot know and cannot tell. Time was when men thought it no more than marks pressed into wax or words scratched onto dried reeds from the river. Then they said it was like them books that gathered dust in libraries. Now they say its like them machines that hum and click and speak in numbers. But all these things is just words and words aint truth.\n\nThe way the mind takes in the world is like this. Light falls on the eye and sound moves through the air and the flesh feels what it touches and all these things become something else. Something that aint quite real no more but aint quite dream neither. The mind takes these things and works em over. Sometimes it works from the bottom up like when you're looking at something you aint never seen before. Other times it works from what it already knows, like when you seen something before and your mind already knows what its fixing to see. Like looking at a black square drawn on white paper. Your eyes see the edges first, where black meets white, but your mind already knows what its gonna be before your eyes is done looking.\n\nThe mind decides what's worth paying mind to and what aint. Like how you can walk across grass and never see each blade even though your eyes take em all in, or how you can hear your name called out in a crowd even when theres a hundred other voices speaking. The mind sifts through it all like a prospector panning for gold.\n\nEverything that goes into the mind has got to be stored somewhere. There's different kinds of storing, like how you can remember something just happened or something from long ago. First the mind has to take it in, like how words can be remembered for how they look wrote down or how they sound spoke or what they mean in the deep dark of your thoughts. Some men who study animals say the quick memories that last about twenty seconds is like electricity running round and round through the brain, while the old memories is stored in the very meat of the mind itself, in them little bits they call proteins.\n\nThey got different ways of thinking bout how all this knowledge is put together in there. Some say its like a web where everything's connected to everything else that's like it. Like how chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on until everything in the world is tied together in ways we cant see but the mind knows. But that's just another story we tell ourselves in the dark.",
            "They called it a crisis but it was more like a slow death. The kind that creeps up on you in the night when you're sleeping warm in your bed dreaming of better days. In 2007 the country fell. Not with cannon fire or trumpet blast but with the quiet clicking of computers and the rustling of papers in tall glass buildings where men in suits watched numbers fall like dead leaves in autumn.\n\nThe streets grew empty. Houses stood like tombstones with their windows dark and their doors locked against owners who would never return. Men who once wore suits now carried cardboard signs at intersections. Their eyes vacant. Their hands trembling. Everything that was solid turned to ash.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton. A president who wanted more years in his white house like a king who cant let go his crown. He loosened the chains that held the banks in check. Let them run wild and free like rabid dogs through the streets of commerce. A man named Holmes wrote about it in the paper. Saw it coming like a man can see storm clouds gathering on a distant horizon. But no one listened. No one ever listens until the rain starts falling.\n\nThey made new kinds of money. Paper promises wrapped in more paper promises. Adjustable rates that adjusted only upward like a hangmans noose drawing ever tighter. CDOs they called them. Complex names for simple greed. The banks grew fat on these paper promises. Built towers of glass and steel that reached toward heaven like the tower of Babel. And like Babel they fell.\n\nWhen it all came apart it came apart fast. Five great houses of money watched their empires crumble. Four point one trillion dollars. Numbers so big they lose all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in the desert. Bear Stearns fell first. Then Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers died in the night. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed. Broken. Transformed into something else entirely. Something lesser.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Names that sound like characters from a childrens story but there was nothing innocent about them. Five trillion in debt. A number that would make God himself weep. The government took them in the end. Like putting down a rabid dog. It had to be done but nobody wanted to watch.\n\nThis is how empires fall. Not with a bang but with the quiet scratch of a pen on paper. With the soft whisper of money changing hands in dark rooms. With promises made that can never be kept. This is how the world ends. Not all at once but piece by piece until theres nothing left but dust and memories and the long dark road ahead.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like birds fallen from winter trees. No life in them. No breath. Just black marks that told of things that never were and never would be. The writer knew this truth but could not help herself from piling more words atop the others like a funeral pyre waiting for flame.\n\nShe'd been taught the old ways. Show dont tell they'd said. As if words could do anything but tell. As if showing wasnt just another kind of lying. But she wrote on anyway, filling pages with histories that never happened to people who never lived. Telling of marriages and murders and meetings in the night. Two lines of dialogue was all she gave them. Two lines to speak their piece before the darkness took them.\n\nThe husband died on page four. Shot through the heart though no one saw it happen. Just words on a page saying he was dead and she was alone and that was that. No time spent watching him move through the world. No chance to know the weight of his presence or the sound of his breath in the dark. Just gone. Like they all go in the end.\n\nThe writer knew better. Knew you had to give them more. Had to put meat on them bones. Had to make them real enough to mourn. But knowing dont make the doing any easier. Sometimes the words come fast and desperate like theyre running from something. Sometimes you just want to get it all down before it slips away. Before the darkness comes.\n\nLike that fellow at the gas station. Ex Air Force they said. Two wives. No kids. Liked to fish. Had dreams about owning the place someday. Ate eggs benedict that morning though God knows where he found hollandaise sauce in this world. All of it true maybe. All of it lies probably. But what difference did it make? He was just words on a page. Just another ghost in a world full of ghosts. Just another story that never got told right.",
            "He watched the news come through the glass eye, the morning light harsh and cold in Columbus. First came word of evil done in Ashley, a man called Hostettler who'd taken blade to wife, the darkness in his eyes staring out from the booking photo like some ancient thing dredged up from below. They gave it two minutes. No more. Just enough to tell of multiple wounds and iron bars that waited.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen summers old and now laid low by gunshot in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The story passed quick as wind through dead grass, like so many tales of the darker folk who fell victim in this godless time. White faces lingered longer on the screen, their stories told and retold until they became legend.\n\nNews of a bullet hole in the flying machine they called Med-Flight. Twenty-two caliber from a rifle, they said. Money offered for the shooter's name, five thousand dollars to break the silence that held his identity like a tomb.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties like restless ghosts. Brief words meant to keep eyes fixed to the screen, bait for the commercial break.\n\nThen robbery at the UDF on Clime Road. They spoke of the thief's blackness like it was a thing you could touch, described his dark skin and hood as if painting some nightmare creature. Six foot tall and lean as a winter wolf. They dwelt on his color like men obsessed with darkness.\n\nLast came word of Rodriguez, the drug lord from Texas. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if counting each month might make the sentence heavier. They named him Hispanic though it mattered not at all to the weight of his crimes or the years that waited to swallow him.\n\nThrough it all the news anchor sat pristine and distant as a priest, passing judgment on the day's sins while outside the real world turned, uncaring and vast beneath an indifferent sky.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand, each figure telling its own tale of worth and loss in the vast wasteland of the market. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing that moved like a serpent through the exchanges, tracking indices and commodities with the cold precision of a predator. Not unlike the mutual funds of old but leaner, meaner, more adapted to survive in these harsh financial climes.\n\nThe boy looked at the figures. What do they mean Papa, he said.\n\nThey mean survival son. A way to spread our chances across the wasteland. Like having many arrows instead of one.\n\nThe numbers showed the truth of it. Ten holdings making up near sixty-four percent of the whole thing. Each one carrying its own weight like pack animals in a caravan across the desert of uncertainty. UnitedHealth Group. CVS Health Corp. Elevance Health. Their percentages written in blood-red ink against the stark white paper.\n\nHe'd done the calculations in the dim light of evening, figures scratched out with a pencil worn nearly to the nub. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, six point eleven percent higher, like a child outgrowing its father. The beta lower by point twelve, as if the offspring had learned to move more cautiously through the financial wilderness.\n\nBut numbers could lie. He knew this like he knew the sound of his own breathing in the dark. Statistical significance hung over the data like a shroud, demanding to be acknowledged. Standard deviations lined up like sentries, each one guarding its own truth about risk and return.\n\nThe market is no country for old men, he thought. It gives no quarter and asks none in return. Each transaction leaving its mark like the fossilized footprints of ancient creatures in stone.\n\nThey sat there in the gathering gloom, father and son, studying the figures as if reading an ancient text that might reveal the secrets of survival in this harsh financial world. The boy looked up at him.\n\nWill it protect us, he said.\n\nYes. If anything can.\n\nBut you're not sure.\n\nNo. I'm not sure. Nothing is sure anymore.\n\nThe numbers stared back at them, cold and unblinking as the eyes of the dead.",
            "The numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month. Just fell away. You could study that Figure 17 til your eyes went dim and still not know the why of it. Winter came hard to them New England grounds like it always did, cold and merciless, and them bicycle riders and walkers just disappeared into whatever shelter they could find. December it was. End of term with its burdens of papers and grades weighing down on everyone like stones. Maybe that commuter log just got lost in the shuffle of things, like so many papers do.\n\nThe holidays came too. Always do. Campus emptied out like a dead town, buildings standing dark and silent against the gray sky. When January dragged itself in, bringing them students and teachers back, weren't many filling out them logs. February was worse. Numbers so low you could count em on one hand. Might be that first fire of excitement just burned itself out, way fires do when there aint nothing left to feed em.\n\nWe tried something then. Called it the Carpool Challenge Week. March it was. Like throwing fresh wood on dying embers, trying to bring that flame back. Worked some. Numbers came up, but they was different somehow. Weaker.\n\nThing about people is they love their cars. Love em like kin. Its in the blood of this country, deep as original sin. We tried to lure em away with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and such. Books too. Even them big store chains. But maybe we should've gone bigger. Bicycle maybe. One of them hybrid cars even. Electric one perhaps. Something to make em sit up and take notice.\n\nThem first prizes worked fine at the start. People's eyes would light up at the mention of em. But they was like giving pennies to a man who needed dollars. If we'd have brought out something bigger in December, maybe one of them bicycles, then come January dropped the news about a car - hybrid or electric, don't matter which - well, might've kept em interested. Might've kept em coming back. Instead of watching em drift away like smoke in that winter wind.",
            "I set to watching them old Edison pictures, them trick films from the turn of the century, fifteen of them laid out before me like cards in some devil's game spanning 1895 to 1901. Strange illusions wrought in silver and light, crafted by men who knew the dark art of cutting and splicing celluloid dreams. They was mostly bound by rules old as theatre itself, rules that grew from the ground like weeds through concrete, choking out any notion of something different.\n\nThey kept their pictures in boxes made of sets and stages, all shot straight on like God himself was watching from the cheap seats. Camera bolted down like it was afraid to move. Everything far off or middling far, never close enough to see a man's soul in his eyes. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. Except when it wasnt.\n\nThe pictures lived in rooms built special for them, rooms with invisible walls facing forward like church pews. Camera didnt follow nothing. It stood there dead still like a hanging judge, watching. This way of doing came down from theatre folk and carnival men who knew about fooling eyes. Characters moved sideways like crabs, never coming forward, never going back. Take that picture Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel. Josh and them others, they shuffle side to side like theyre afraid of something in the deep dark behind the lens.\n\nThey shot everything from far off, sometimes a little closer but never close enough to count teeth. Never saw nobody's eyes up close in them days. Theatre folk taught them that too, keeping everything in view all at once like God intended. Actors stayed back where they belonged, away from the glass eye watching them.\n\nMost times one shot was all there was, one minute of magic before the light died. Wasnt much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and switches, people appearing and vanishing like smoke in wind. But them shots wasnt always what they seemed. Take that old picture of Mary Queen of Scots getting her head cut off. Look close enough and youll see where they stitched the death together, like a butcher hiding the seam in meat.",
            "The Gothic tale aint new and it aint old neither. It's both and that's what Ian Watt called it in his book about such things. Some folks praised it and others cursed it and said it was hollow inside like an old dried gourd left too long in the field. But it had power in it. The kind that makes men shiver and think about what's beyond the dark.\n\nThe first of these tales came from Horace Walpole who wrote about a castle and things that happened there. He took old things and new things and mixed them together like a man might mix water and whiskey, knowing neither one alone would do what he needed. The story he made was full of old stone and older shadows, full of things from medieval times when men built great towers that reached up toward God like the fingers of dead men reaching through dirt.\n\nIn them days the word gothic meant different things to different folk. Some thought it meant barbarians and others thought it meant them pointed arches in old churches where the light comes down in dusty beams like God's own fingers touching earth. Most folk thought it was something dead and gone, like bones bleaching in the sun. But Walpole, he took that dead thing and breathed life into it, made it walk again.\n\nThe heart of these tales was something called chivalry. Not the kind where men open doors for women but the old kind, where knights rode out into the dark carrying steel and faith like twin flames against the night. Walpole saw his own time was missing something. Something important that had gotten lost like a coin dropped in tall grass. He was living in troubled times when men's hearts had gone cold and their honor had dried up like creek beds in summer.\n\nIn his tale there's a man called Frederic who carries the old ways in him like embers in ash. Before you even meet him you know what he is. A prince who's suffered and bled and been thought dead at the hands of heathens. He's what knights was supposed to be, though Walpole made him larger than life, like a shadow cast by candlelight that stretches tall against a wall.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to finished goods it winds its way across the land leaving tracks of commerce in its wake. Oliver found it first back in 82, gave it a name though it had existed long before any man thought to call it such. Six parts to the beast: the making and the getting, the keeping and the placing, the moving and the knowing. All of it bound together like vertebrae in some ancient creature's spine.\n\nThe making comes first. Always has. Always will. Must know what's needed fore you can birth it into being. The market speaks if you know how to listen, tells you what folk hunger for in their bones. Managers stand like prophets reading signs in the wind, counting volume and quality like priests counting sacrificial lambs. Choose wrong and the whole thing falls to dust and ash. Seen it before in them big box stores where I done my time. Walmart. Target. Each one with their own scripture writ down in manuals thick as bibles, telling how every little thing ought be done from the way a man wears his clothes to how the trucks get emptied of their guts.\n\nThe getting comes next. Strategic they call it, like generals planning war. Deciding what each place can do best, what parts to keep close and what to send out to others. Sometimes you got to spread the work around, let other outfits take their piece. They call it velocity when they do that, though it ain't about speed so much as it's about being nimble while keeping the coin in your pocket. Like a man trying to dance quick without spilling his whiskey.\n\nEach facility stands like its own fortress. Got its own soldiers with their own weapons, each one knowing their part in the greater war of commerce. Management looks down from high walls deciding where the strength lies, where the weakness shows. Sometimes they send the work away, let other armies fight them battles. All of it moving like blood through veins, keeping the great beast alive.",
            "The books of that age bore the weight of detail like ornate Victorian mansions, all finery and aristocratic airs. But there were two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These carried something else in them. Something raw. Something that crept through the pages like a night-thing, unnamed and watchful. Mystery lived in their bones and the peculiar haunted their margins and this strangeness gave their people flesh and blood and hearts that beat true.\n\nThere was a passage where the boy Oliver walked in darkness. He moved between Sikes and Crackit like a ghost might walk between two demons arguing in hell. Their voices came to him across some vast distance though they stood at his shoulders. Then gunfire split the night and screaming rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights bloomed in the dark. Pain lived in him then, deep and constant as breathing. Some unseen hand bore him away through this fever-dream of blood and noise and he could not fight it. Could not even try.\n\nThese nightmares they wrote into their books served different purposes but all showed the truth that lived beneath. In Oliver's tale they revealed what lay coiled in his heart, what ate at him in the dark hours, what whispered to him about the true nature of things. When they shot the boy and he relived it later it came back like a tide of darkness. No control did he have then. No power over his own destiny. The pain had made its home in him by then, wed to fear rather than shock. And through it all ran the question of whose will had brought him to this place, for surely it was not his own. The old jew Fagin had begun his work by then, breaking the boy piece by piece until despair became as natural as breathing. Even with death at his heels Oliver could not fight. Could not even try to save himself.\n\nThe day that followed was no day at all but merely night's brief absence. Then true night came again, somehow endless in its terrible silence yet fleeting in its hours, as if time itself had gone mad in the darkness.",
            "There was a time I worked with the young ones, after their schooling was done for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy named Adrian, dark eyes and quiet like they sometimes are. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters all scattered in his mind like windblown leaves. Some he knew true and others might as well have been marks made by birds in the dust.\n\nHe spoke the English good enough. Clean and clear like any American child. Latino blood in him sure but you'd never know it from his speech. We worked at it, him and me, day after day until his mother came. It was during a field trip day and I was watching the ones left behind. She came in speaking no English at all. Just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor, broken things really, but we made do. And then I knew. Knew it like you know the coming of winter. The boy could read fine enough. Just not in English. The letters were foreign to him like tracks in the snow.\n\nThe language wall stands high in these schools. Higher in California than most places. Sometimes you cant even see it until youre right up on it. Even those that speak the English perfect as morning light, reading it can be like crossing a river in flood. Everyone knows this truth but knowing aint fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him the letters. Show him the sounds they make. But for the others, the ones who barely know English at all, theres no simple answer. Dual language. Immersion. Special teachers. ESL. None of these alone will do it. You need them all together like fingers making a fist.\n\nThe dual language way, thats something worth considering. Not just for the Spanish speakers but all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folk fear it. Say its wasteful. Say it wont help the majority. But thats not true. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all rise. Dont need every teacher speaking both tongues. That aint realistic. But having some that do, special helpers who know both worlds, that might be the way. Might be the only way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant know with your mind. Some go to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some go elsewhere and some just look inside themselves til their eyes go dark with looking. Most take what their people gave them like a worn coat passed down. Others spit on it all and say theres nothing but what they can hold in their own two hands. We take up one way of seeing then trade it for another like old coins we found in the dirt. No matter. We all walk that same road looking for that thing bigger than ourselves. Looking for some light in all that dark to lead us home.\n\nPapa set in that old chair on the porch, rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Sound like gravel in a metal drum. We smoked together and watched the rain drown them flowers along the porch edge where the gutters spilled. Asked him what bird he liked best and he said Cardinal and then he just stared out into that rain. Looking and not looking. Clothes hanging off him like someone elses skin. Hair thin now where it used to be thick. He wouldnt look at me and I couldnt speak the words that needed speaking. Words about missing and about loss. Speaking them would make the loss more real somehow. More final. I moved my chair closer to his. Hugged him once. Then we just watched that June rain come down in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twentytwo. They gave him radiation and poison to fight the thing growing inside him but it just made him suffer longer. I lay in bed nights asking what sort of God would do such a thing. No prayers came. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didnt watch him go. Didnt want to see the life that made my life drain away like water in sand. Wanted to remember him living not dying. Known him better than any of them anyway. Known he wouldnt want his boy watching death take him. So I curled up in my bed like some hurt animal and waited three days for word.\n\nWord never came.",
            "The man they called John Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his plantation with purpose, knowing in his bones what the land could teach about freedom and governance. He was a farmer first and always would be, though the affairs of men had pulled him brief into their politics. The soil spoke to him of sovereignty and justice and the rights of men to work the earth as they saw fit.\n\nHe saw America raw and new like fresh-plowed ground, unencumbered by the dead weight of tradition that plagued the old world. Here was earth waiting to be seeded with self-governance. He knew about rights. Natural rights. How they tangled together like roots in rich soil, one failing and all failing, withering under the boot of government overreach. These were things no man should touch.\n\nThe state of nature, some called it. Taylor knew better. Knew how the strong and cunning would always prey upon the weak without the structures of civilization to bind them. But civilization itself was a double-edged blade.\n\nHe believed men carried both light and dark within them, good principles and bad bound together like wheat and chaff. Good principles protected what a man owned, nurtured the land, kept the money-changers at bay. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but it turned poison when it led to parasitic sub-societies feeding off the public good.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time he called for strict adherence to the Constitution, wanted federal power bound tight as a starving dog. He'd seen how bloated government bred despotism like flies on carrion. But simple reading of law wasn't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who wrote it. The Declaration, that was the true charter. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation bound in iron chains of central control.\n\nHe knew these things bone-deep, like he knew the feel of soil crumbling between his fingers. The truth of it was in the land itself, in the sweat and toil of honest work. Everything else was just words floating away on the wind.",
            "He stood there watchin the brown mass in the water below. Silent. Studying it with a detachment that came from years of such work. Thoughts like autumn leaves blown across an empty lot, there and gone again. His mind moved like water over stone, smooth and without purchase.\n\nHe remembered the art book. Some woman had give it to him years ago when he was still dreamin of bein an artist. Said it would teach him bout seein things proper. How to frame em up in your mind. Make em simpler. But there wasnt nothin simple about what he was lookin at now. No frame could contain it. Just stood there like a man before some terrible altar, his green tie hangin down like a hanged mans tongue.\n\nIf them old painters had their colors then this here was his. His testimony. His offering to whatever god watched over such things. Brown and perfect in its way. Like some cosmic joke played out in porcelain.\n\nHis hand found the handle. Pulled it. Watched the water swirl and eddy, clear as mountain stream water. The mass broke apart some but wouldnt go. Like it had made some covenant with the bowl. He flushed again. And again. Each time watchin the water rise and fall like the breath of some sleepin beast.\n\nFinally he reached for the paper. Started wrappin his hand like them ancient peoples wrapped their dead. Layer after layer till his hand was swaddled in white. A priest preparin for some unholy sacrament. He bent at the waist, his arm descendin slow into them cool waters like a man reachin down into hell itself to shake hands with the devil.\n\nThe fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Silent witnesses to this ritual played out in a Rite Aid bathroom on some nameless Tuesday in a world that had long since stopped carin about such things. About the men who cleaned up after it. About anything at all.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers but the dead speak nothing of their passing. The National Institutes say the young brain aint ready, like green wood that wont take a proper shape no matter how you work it. Inexperience kills them sure as any bullet. Their vehicles roll and speed and leave the road like wild things seeking their own destruction.\n\nWhen they gather they die together. Like moths to flame. The California men who study such things showed it plain as day in their charts and papers. Numbers that tell of dead children stacked like cordwood.\n\nThe state men made their laws. Papers that say when the young ones can drive and who they can carry. As if paper could stop death. But these are just words written in offices by men who've forgotten what it was to be young and wild and immortal.\n\nEven eighteen's too young says the doctor Zuckerman who studies such things. They seek the thrill like animals seeking water in drought, he says. They cant help themselves no more than a wolf can help howling at the moon. Wait till the blood cools, he says. Wait till they aint so ready to die.\n\nMore are coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they was reaching for loaded guns. By 2010 theyll flood the roads like water breaking through a dam. Death rides shotgun with them all.\n\nThe fix aint hard to see though men make it seem so. Keep them learning in their schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen's past. Let them practice with their elders watching. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows death's way. Make it the same in every state cause death dont care about state lines.\n\nSome will say this aint new thinking. And they'd be right. Truth rarely is. But the dead dont care about new or old. They just stay dead all the same.",
            "The boy looked up at him and asked what was wrong with people who couldn't hear right. Not deaf folk, he said, but them that hear wrong somehow. The man studied the ashen sky before speaking.\n\nThey call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, he said. CAPD. Where your ears work fine but your brain cant make sense of what it hears. Like trying to read tracks in the sand after the wind's got to them.\n\nThe boy thought about this. But they can hear?\n\nYes, the man said. They hear but the sounds get twisted somehow. Like looking through dirty glass. Everything's there but nothing's clear.\n\nThey sat watching the dead leaves scatter across the broken parking lot. The man remembered doctors from before. Men in white coats with clipboards who'd study children like they were reading maps to some foreign country. Testing them. Making them listen to sounds and words that came through headphones like distant echoes. Started back in the fifties, he said. Italian doctors. They'd put different words in each ear and watch what happened.\n\nHow do you know if someone has it?\n\nSometimes they cant tell where sounds come from. Like they're lost in space. Sometimes words get jumbled up. Or they cant hear someone talking if there's other noise. Like their brain cant sort out what's important.\n\nThe boy picked up a stick and drew in the dust. What happens to them?\n\nThey need help, the man said. Used to be teachers would know what to do. Special ways of teaching. Special places to sit in class. But that was before. Before all this.\n\nHe gestured at the wasteland around them. The boy nodded, understanding more than he should have to. They sat in silence for a while, listening to the wind move through the dead city.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he was sixteen and afraid and his eyes darted like small animals in a trap. He'd fled from them that raised him, them that should have loved him but didn't. I watched him there and knew what I had to do.\n\nYears before I'd walked the halls of learning seeking knowledge of the mind and its workings. Studied the way folk cope with the darkness in them or flee from it or deny it altogether. Got my papers in Psychology but still the path ahead was dark and unknown like a road at night with no stars to guide by.\n\nThe next day I went to where his people lived. The police were there already, standing in the yard like sentinels in blue. I told them what I knew, told them of my learning in the ways of the mind. They bid me speak to the parents, said the law's hands were tied in such matters. The mother and father spoke in circles, nervous words about their boy being manipulative, about simple disputes made large. But their eyes told different tales. I knew then what I must become.\n\nJustice is a thing we speak of but seldom see. We claim to value the singular soul but we make all souls alike, press them into shapes acceptable to the many. In my younger days I raged against this with wild-colored hair and metal in my flesh and clothes that spoke my truth. Stood with those that society cast aside - the different ones, the ones that loved different from the rest. Fought the old hatreds wherever I found them.\n\nNow I aim to help the lost ones, the broken ones. To work with those cast aside by their own blood. My values are hewn from stone: service to others, respect for their dignity, truth in all dealings. These aren't just words but the very marrow of who I am. The path ahead is clear now, like a road at dawn with the sun rising blood-red in the east. I'll walk it and help who I can along the way.",
            "He set the papers down before him and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and the wanting of it. The darkness that comes unbidden or not at all. He knew these things. The old doctors with their studies and their microscopes looking for answers in the brains of mice while all around them the world burned away to ash.\n\nThey called it insomnia but that word was just a marker for something deeper and more terrible. Something that lived in the blood and bones of men. In their very cells. The hypothalamus with its secret languages of sleep and waking. Neurons firing or not firing. The terrible democracy of consciousness that gave no quarter and took no prisoners.\n\nHe thought about the mice in their cages. The scientists watching them through glass walls while strange chemicals coursed through their blood. GABAB receptors. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice slept or didn't sleep and men wrote down numbers in ledgers and thought they understood something about the night.\n\nBut there were other truths. Darker ones. The kind that lived in the spaces between people. In their histories and their bloodlines. In the weight of generations. Sleep disorders they called them. As if disorder wasnt the natural state of things. As if order was something more than a temporary rebellion against chaos.\n\nThe sociocultural model. The biological model. Words that tried to explain why some men slept while others lay awake counting their breaths in the dark. But they were just words. The truth was in the darkness itself. In the terrible silence between heartbeats. In the long hours before dawn when a man could feel the weight of all his ancestors pressing down on him like stones.\n\nHe thought about the people who couldn't sleep. How they moved through the world like ghosts. How their days bled into their nights until time itself became meaningless. School. Work. The rituals of the living. All of it just shadows on the wall of a cave that got deeper and darker with each passing hour.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like a slow river through the valley of days. When I first come here they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of everything where the wind blows cold and merciless across empty fields. Beyond lay only the stadium and the center they call Bryce Jordan, standing like ancient monuments to some forgotten civilization.\n\nThe walk from Stuart Hall to Willard building was a pilgrimage through wasteland, twenty-five minutes if the weather held, longer when the sky turned black and the rain came sideways like it does in State College. An old timer told me once how East Halls used to stand alone out there, separated from everything by dead ground that stretched on forever. Now they've filled it all in. Sports fields. New buildings risen up like concrete monoliths. The Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks circled round like wagons against the night.\n\nThe campus grows like some mindless thing, devouring space, making distance where there was none before. But there's an answer to this vastness. The bicycle. Simple as scripture. Mechanical and true. Though the machine itself aint worth nothing without riders to push the pedals, and paths to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years away from it. Said he couldn't recollect why he ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, like he'd discovered some profound truth written in steel and rubber. And he wasnt wrong. Bowl of oatmeal and muscle gets you thirty miles. Maybe more.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dorm. Got myself a bike. Best decision I ever made in this place. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minute walk but five minutes riding if you're willing to push. Pollock Road's the straightest shot but it aint always favorable. Could walk, I suppose, if I was of a mind to waste time. But time's a currency I cant afford to spend. Thirty minutes extra each way. Two and a half hours gone each week, vanished like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's too precious for that kind of waste.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was to come. A world of machines and men who were no longer men. The book spoke of a controller who watched over all things like some dark god. In this world there was no love. No hatred neither. Just the endless consumption of things that meant nothing at all.\n\nThe people there were born into their stations like cattle bred for slaughter. Each one marked from birth to serve their purpose and nothing more. They called it conditioning but it was slavery plain and simple. The lower orders knew nothing of their chains. Kept docile with drugs and empty pleasures while those above them pulled the strings.\n\nHe thought about how the classes moved among each other like ghosts. No true touching. No true knowing. The men spoke of women like they were things made of air and flesh and nothing more. Pneumatic was the word they used. As if the curves of a woman's body were something to be measured like tire pressure. The women no better. Speaking of their couplings like discussing the weather or what they had for breakfast.\n\nEach class stayed in its place like layers in a cake gone stale. The high born alphas and betas looking down from their towers while the others scurried below. All of them prisoners though most didnt know it. Kept in line with promises of happiness that was no happiness at all. Just pleasure without meaning. Without cost. Without pain.\n\nThe controller stood above it all like some dark spider in its web. Watching. Waiting. Feeding them all the same sweet poison that kept them docile and consuming and believing they were free when they were anything but. A machine built of flesh and bone and blood that ground on and on toward nothing at all except its own perpetuation.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark thinking about how the world was headed down that same road. How men were becoming less than men. How love was dying. How the things that made us human were being stripped away one by one until nothing would be left but the hollow shell of what we once were. And he knew that this was what the writer had seen coming all those years ago. This was what he had tried to warn us about. But who would listen. Who would care. Who would even understand.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room learning of Islam and its ways. The question hung heavy in the air like smoke, whether this faith carried violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, watching the world turn and darken since them towers fell. The papers and screens that once spoke with venom against the faithful now bend backwards in tolerance, as if afraid of their own shadow. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, with Islam running through his blood like a dark river, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me some. What they write of him and what history shows stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a dusty street. In my mind I see him as he was, sword in hand, forcing men to kneel and accept his truth or taste steel. Yet here in these pages he walks soft, humble as a child, drawing men to him like moths to flame. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, bearing his burden in silence while truth worked its way through men's hearts.\n\nThere's something that ain't right about how they mirror the Christ's works in Muhammad's deeds. They tell of him making meat and milk stretch beyond nature's bounds, feeding forty men where there was food for few. It reads false, like a man trying to wear another's skin. They diminish the true miracle of Jesus, stealing his glory to dress their prophet in borrowed light.\n\nThe stories they tell come handed down through too many mouths, like water poured from cup to cup until you can't trust what's left. This man told that man who heard from another - truth gets thin when stretched so far. They mean it as proof but it reads like smoke and mirrors, each telling making the tale more suspect.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is how they fashion him gentle and wise, a shepherd leading his flock with soft words and softer heart. But history speaks different. It speaks of blood and steel and conquest. Sometimes I wonder if the faithful today know the truth of it, or if they too believe in this phantom prophet, this ghost of gentleness that never was.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like dead leaves in the wind that followed. If you were to stand upon some high place and look down across the vastness of time you'd see how the truth of it all just kept moving further and further away like some dream you cant quite remember when you wake. These days there's a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasn't there before. The old ones who cling to what their fathers told them and their fathers before them still remain but they're getting fewer, like dying embers in a cold hearth.\n\nAmong them that call themselves Christian there's going to be an awakening. Like water rising slow and steady in some ancient well. They'll start peeling away at what men added to the words. Layer by layer. Year by year. Maybe it'll take generations but it'll come sure as night follows day. The clock of time spinning backwards until there aint nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about God.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the white man it'll wash clean the churches but wont destroy them. They'll still stand like weathered sentinels. But something strange will happen. All them differences between believers will start fading away like footprints in the sand when the tide comes in. History's got a way of turning back on itself. Like how Rome went from killing Christians to bowing before their cross. Or how this country went from keeping men in chains to letting them lead.\n\nYou go back far enough and there was just the Jews. That's where it all started. Before Christ walked the earth they had their one God and their holy books and their laws handed down since Moses' time. Back when Rome took Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ the Jews weren't of one mind neither. They had their divisions. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. And then there was just the common folk, carrying their beliefs like stones in their pockets, wearing them smooth with worry and wonder.",
            "They was greed in them and it was a thing that could not be denied nor cast out. Like some darkness that dwelled in the heart of man since time was time. The Jungle showed this truth plain as day. Showed it in the way men conducted their affairs and in the way they turned their eyes from the suffering of others like it was nothing to them at all.\n\nThe factory men stood highest among these. Lords of their concrete kingdoms rising black against the sky, smoke pouring forth like the breath of some industrial beast. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing against the heavens, smoke streaming endless to the edge of the world as if God himself had blessed their venture. But there was no blessing in it. Only the slow poisoning of everything that drew breath.\n\nThey cared nothing for the workers that made their fortunes. Nothing for the men and women broken on the wheels of progress. The whole of Packingtown was nothing but a cauldron of hate and desperation where a man's worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. They'd lay off hundreds without warning, casting them into the streets like so much offal. No law stood between the workers and their masters in them days. No protection from the speed-ups and the dangerous machines and the bone-grinding labor that left men dead before their time.\n\nThe people who lived and died there had no choice but to endure. Like chattel they was, bound to the factories by hunger and desperation. Foreign folks mostly, hanging by a thread over starvation's abyss, their fates tied to the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And like slavery it bred a particular kind of darkness in the soul. A corruption that spread through them streets like a disease, touching everything it encountered. Making monsters of men who might otherwise have been decent folk.\n\nThem factory owners stood atop it all like kings of old, counting their money while below them the masses suffered. They breathed different air than the working folk. Ate different food. Their children played in parks while the children of the workers played in gutters filled with offal and blood from the killing floors. That was the way of it. The natural order they'd created, as merciless as nature herself.",
            "In the darkened corridors of literary history there was a poem called Dream-land and Poe had writ it and called it among his finest works. The word Thulé lay buried in its verses like some ancient rune, appearing twice as though summoned from older tongues. Mabbott traced it back to Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, an isle north of Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there were other wells from which such waters might have sprung.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like cold iron striking flame in the darkness of his thoughts. Goethe chief among them, his Faust a thing of terrible beauty published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in the year of his death, 1832. Within that second part lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed leaving him naught but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep of both till at last he cast the cup into the sea and followed after, his eyes closing on the world forever.\n\nThe shadows between these works ran deep as wells. Dream-land and The King of Thulé stood as mirror-dark reflections, each echoing loss and loneliness and the color leaching out of all things. The speaker in Dream-land walked as though he'd stepped into Goethe's world itself, seeing what that ancient king had seen, feeling what he had felt in those last moments on the cliff's edge.\n\nGoethe's name carried weight that even Poe could not ignore. When asked of Tennyson, Poe spoke of both men in the same breath, their words carrying across oceans and years in endless adaptations and tellings. The darkness in their verses called to his own, and in Dream-land that darkness found its echo, twice-told and terrible in its beauty.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that October evening eating his dinner while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold linoleum like some pale viscous blood. First came Wayne telling him of the danger and then Haddigan but he paid them no mind. The food was warm in his mouth and he had no time for such things. No time at all.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five walking the fluorescent aisles like a pilgrim in some retail wasteland. She didnt see the spill. How could she. The floor was slick and treacherous and she went down hard onto the tiles, her spine cracking like green wood in winter. Behind the security cameras watched with their dead glass eyes recording everything and nothing.\n\nThere had been others before her. Five souls who'd fallen in that same store that year alone. Their bodies hitting the floor like sacks of wet cement. Each time the manager had known. Each time he had chosen to look away. The law called it conscious disregard but it was something older than that. Something primitive and dark that lived in the spaces between duty and indifference.\n\nIn California the statutes spoke of punitive damages for acts committed with oppression fraud or malice. Cold words for cold deeds. The courts had ruled on such things before. They knew malice when they saw it. Knew it in the willful turning away from consequence. Knew it in the deliberate blindness to the rights of others. The manager had seen the danger coming like storm clouds on the horizon but he had chosen to let it come. Let whatever would happen happen.\n\nThe judge would have to look at it now. Would have to weigh the despicable nature of it. Six people fallen. Six bodies broken on his watch. The manager sitting in his office that evening spooning food into his mouth while danger waited in the aisles like some patient predator. No. This wasnt something that could be dismissed with the wave of a gavel. The malice lay there as plain as the spilled applesauce on the store floor. As plain as the broken woman who now sought her justice.",
            "The wanting had been there since she was fourteen. A hollow thing that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone now and still it gnawed at her like some dark beast crouched in the chambers of her heart. Not a thing she needed but someone. The boys came and went like pale ghosts. Their awkward advances met with silence. She studied herself in the mirror nights, questioning what darkness lay within that made her this way. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her mother and father walked soft through the rooms like spirits themselves, rarely raising voices against each other or their daughter save when she blazed forth with that wild fire that burned in her. A fire they hadnt known the source of. She carried it like a torch through the world and folk were drawn to its light.\n\nBut this day the quiet broke. A scream tore through the morning air from the kitchen where her mother stood. The girl ran. Mama she called. Mama what is it. Her mother lay twisted on the tile floor making small animal sounds of pain. The girl knelt beside her and laid hands on her mothers shoulder. Hospital the mother said through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like a child, grateful for the strength in her arms, and carried her through the door to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of spirits and sick folk and death but she paid it no mind. Carried her mother through the sliding doors calling out for help in a voice that echoed off the sterile walls. White coats descended like vultures. They took her mother away on a rolling bed and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps.\n\nLater they told her how her mother had fallen reaching for some old pottery piece high up in the kitchen cabinets. As if such things mattered now. As if anything mattered but the soft rise and fall of her mothers chest in the hospital bed. The girl sat vigil through the night watching. Watching and waiting while outside the window the world spun on uncaring through the dark.",
            "They sought to know of hearts and their failings and of the old ways of eating that might keep a man from the darkness that comes with disease. The Mediterranean way they called it though it wasnt really about the sea at all but about the things that grew from the earth and the creatures that swam in those waters. The old people who lived there knew things about food that the modern world had forgotten. They ate the fruits of trees and grains from the field and fish from the waters and they drank wine in moderation as men have done since time out of mind.\n\nThey watched seventy four thousand women for twenty years. Nurses they were all of them. Each two years time they would write down what they ate and what they drank and the watchers would give them numbers based on how close they kept to the old ways. The women grew older. Some sickened and died. Some had their hearts give out and some had their minds stolen by clots in their brains that came silent and terrible in the night.\n\nThe watchers kept their vigil through all those years marking down in their books when one would fall. They checked the death papers and the hospital records and sometimes even the cut flesh itself to be certain of what had taken each one. When they could not be certain they marked it probable and kept counting anyway for that was all they could do.\n\nThey found that those who kept closest to the old ways were less likely to be taken. The numbers showed it clear as day. Of those who ate as their ancestors had eaten only seventy one of every hundred suffered what the others did. The rest were spared though no one could say why exactly. Perhaps it was the earth itself protecting those who still remembered how to eat of it properly. Perhaps it was something else entirely. Something older. Something that had been waiting in the blood since before men knew how to write such things down.\n\nThe numbers told their story but numbers are just shadows on paper and paper burns and shadows fade and in the end all that remains is what was and what wasnt and the long dark road between the two.",
            "The sign said Hitler lived in Burma and the girl held it overhead like some proclamation of doom. She stood alone on that corner in the gray morning light, the cardboard sign stark against the pallid sky. The words were writ in black marker, crude and prophetic.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of old temples and new terrors where men in olive drab had seized power years past, their rifles still warm from the taking. The monks came first in their robes color of flame and sunset. Saffron Revolution, they named it. As if revolution could be distilled to mere color. The people followed after, drawn to the monks like moths to fire until the streets filled with their prayers and their rage.\n\nThe junta watched and waited. Patient as serpents. Then they struck. They came in the night for the monasteries, boots on ancient stone, rifle butts splintering temple doors that had stood centuries. They gathered the foreign press like cattle, herded them into cells. One Japanese man lay dead in the street, his camera still clicking its last frames as his blood spread black on the pavement. Thirteen dead said the papers. But the colonel who fled spoke of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle. The earth drinks deep of such offerings.\n\nIt was nothing new under the sun. Since men first built walls they sought to rule what lay within them. Roman emperors crowned themselves with divinity. Japanese kings claimed celestial birth. Even now our leader takes counsel from prophets of folly, their words carried on wires across the continent like the muttering of ghosts.\n\nThe dead keep their own accounts. In China they gathered in the square that June, students and workers crying freedom into the dawn until the tanks came grinding through the night. Two hundred said the state. Three thousand said the truth. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, neighbor against neighbor until the streets ran red. And before them all came Hitler with his camps and his chambers and his dream of racial purity bought with smoke and ash.\n\nThe girl stood holding her sign. The wind moved her hair. Above, the sky threatened rain. Some truths cant be buried, no matter how deep you dig the grave.",
            "He sat at that piano like a man possessed of something darker than mere talent. The legacy of Duke Ellington aint just in the years he spent making that music but in how he shaped and molded them players like clay in his hands. His own playing was quiet. Subtle. Like whispers in the night. But when he wrote them pieces they came out rich and complex as blood, each one crafted special for them men who played em.\n\nHe knew what each man could do. Knew it deep in his bones. Built frameworks where they could blow free as birds but then hed write these tight orchestrated parts that called on what was particular to each player. Something in their soul that needed telling. The whole orchestra had a sound like nothing else in this world. Original. Pure. Each piece different but carrying that same blood through its veins.\n\nTake that Creole Love Call. Voice used like any other instrument might be. No words to get in the way of what needed saying. Six parts to it like this:\n\nFirst theres that call and response tween voice and reeds. Smooth at first then turning rough like old leather. Then comes a muted trumpet crying out blue notes that'd break your heart. High clarinet floating over piano next, then the whole band taking up that first theme again. Fifth part building like a storm with them reeds calling high and brass answering like thunder. Last part going back to where it started, voice turning to something else entirely. Something that growled like some night creature. Brief ending like a whispered goodbye.\n\nHot and Bothered came later. Miley on that muted trumpet speaking back and forth with Baby Cox's voice, neither one quite human nor quite instrument but something in between. It Don't Mean a Thing brought Nanton in, man they called Tricky Sam, working that trombone like it was speaking in tongues.\n\nThis was the sound of something being born in American music. Something that hadnt been there before and wouldnt never be there quite the same way again. Dark and beautiful and terrible all at once. Like watching the sun go down on the last day of the world.",
            "He sat there studying the shell like some ancient thing pulled from the earth's deep memory. The whorl of it spiraling through time and space like the thoughts of dead men. Like the thoughts of God himself. The columella running through its heart like a spine, each turn marking the passage of time in calcium and death. He knew there were laws to such things. Mathematical certainties that men like Thompson had tried to capture with numbers and equations back in 1917 though they might as well have been trying to measure the soul.\n\nThe shell lay there in the pale light. Its aperture gazing up like some blind eye, each whorl growing larger as it spiraled outward from that first beginning, that point where life had started its slow accretion of being. The sutures between each turn marked clear as property lines on some dead man's map. Body whorl fat and final like the period at the end of a death sentence.\n\nHe turned it in his hands. Apical view showing the spiral from above, then basal, then apertural with its opening like a mouth frozen mid-speech. Could count the whorls if you knew how. Draw a line through its heart and follow the spiral out, marking quarter turns like time on some cosmic clock.\n\nThe trajectory of it all could be mapped. Could be measured and marked with numbers that meant something to men who believed such things could be contained in mathematics. But he knew better. Knew that evolution moved like water over stone, wearing away at the edges of possibility until something new emerged from the darkness. Like those Prunum shells they studied with their X-rays and computers, trying to divine the boundaries of what could be from what was.\n\nThe shell sat heavy in his hand. Each whorl a perfect geometric progression through space, each turn following laws old as stone. Laws that men like Stone tried to capture in programs like CerioShell, thinking they could model life's possibilities like architects planning cities. But the truth was in the shell itself. In the cold calcium spiral that had once housed life, now empty as a desert church.\n\nHe set it down gentle as laying a child to rest. The mathematics of it all meant nothing really. Just men trying to measure the immeasurable, to contain the infinite in finite terms. The shell would keep its secrets. Would stay mute as bone while men scratched equations in the dust, trying to understand why life moves as it does through the long dark of time.",
            "They sat there in the dim light of the office studying the numbers on the page. Numbers that told of death. Of children lost. Of mothers gone. Indonesia. A place far off where the sun rose first and where death stalked the villages and towns like some dark specter that would not rest.\n\nTen years gone and nothing changed. The dying went on. While some things got better like water and ways to keep clean the children kept dying and the mothers too. Too many to count. Too many to bear. He looked at the paper again. The reasons written there in black ink that told nothing of the truth of it.\n\nSeventy-two percent they said. Birth helpers there to catch the babies as they came into the world. But these weren't doctors. Just women who knew the old ways. When the blood came they could do nothing but watch it flow. Watch the mothers slip away into that dark country from which no traveler returns.\n\nIn the cities things were better. Seven births cut from the belly for every hundred. In the country only two. The numbers told their own story. The rich lived. The poor died. Twenty-seven percent difference between them that had and them that didn't. Money bought life. Always had.\n\nHe thought about the programs they wanted to build. Vertical they called them. Like towers reaching up into nothing. But you couldn't build towers without foundations and the foundations weren't there. The system was broken. Had always been broken. Would stay broken until someone fixed it proper.\n\nThey'd seen it before. Money flowing like water into one thing. AIDS they called it. Death by another name. While the family planning dried up and blew away like dust in the wind. People followed the money. Always had. Always would. Made more paperwork. More forms. More ways to count the dead.\n\nThe numbers stared back at him from the page. Cold. Implacable. Like the eyes of something that lived in the deep dark places of the earth. Something that fed on suffering. On death. On the tears of mothers holding their dead children. He folded the paper and put it away. Some things you couldn't fix with numbers. Some things you couldn't fix at all.",
            "The dark waters of popular music run deep and cold now, deeper than any man could count in years. A hundred winters have passed and still the genres multiply like vermin in the night, breeding new forms that crawl forth into the light. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each one spawning bastard children of their own, sub-genres writhing beneath sub-genres until the names mean nothing at all.\n\nBut it was Heavy Metal that grew the blackest roots, spreading like some malignant vine through forty years of American soil. They say it speaks in tongues of darkness, voices that carry pain and rage and something older still. Something that was there before the music, before the instruments, before the men who played them.\n\nThe metal came like a storm in the night and when it passed nothing was the same. Men took what they found in its wake and forged new sounds, hammered them into shapes that had no names. Now the metal runs in so many streams that no man can say where one ends and another begins. To know the truth of it you got to go back to the source, back to where it first came bubbling up from the ground like black oil.\n\nMetal carries darkness in its bones. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the strings, more blood in the throat of every singer. These weren't no primitive howlers neither. These were craftsmen who knew their tools like a hunter knows his rifle. And there were drugs too, oh yes. Mid-seventies saw a flood of chemicals that turned men's minds inside out, made them see things that weren't there and hear music that hadn't existed before. They blamed it on the drugs but the darkness was in them all along, waiting.\n\nThe old music had been afraid to look into that darkness. But metal stared right into it, reached in and pulled out something raw and bleeding. Like them old Romantic composers who wrote about death and devils, only now it came through amplifiers tall as men, through speakers that could shatter glass. Even the Beatles caught that fever. Their song Helter Skelter came crawling out like something born in a cave, all teeth and hunger. They'd heard what the Stones were doing and wanted to prove they could swim in those same black waters. They did too, though some say that's where the trouble started.",
            "He came before them all, before them dreampainters with their wild visions, Henri Rousseau crafting his own dreams both in sleep and wake. The Dream they called it, made in 1910, showing a woman laid bare in wonderment at some savage paradise, but it was Rousseau's own dreaming too that lived there on that canvas. Recognition he sought, acceptance from them that made art and them that loved it, but the path to such things was dark and winding and full of thorns.\n\nThe Dream stood testament to his struggle, that war between conforming to what others wanted and walking alone down his own dark road. Born in Laval in 1844 to a tinsmith who had some money but not much else. No schooling in art did he receive, worked forty years as a gabelou collecting coins at the town gates though they called him douanier like he was something more than he was. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground, leaving him with just Julia and a grief that sat in his chest like a stone. Painting became his refuge, his escape from the darkness that surrounded him.\n\nHe wasnt like them other painters who made pretty pictures of peasants with their romantic notions. He was of the folk and painted like the folk, carrying their hopes in his hands like water. His wanting to be accepted by them art folk was a thing you could understand if you looked at it right. No education had he in the ways of painting and was old when he started, working alongside them that had made names for themselves already.\n\nMatisse was rising then, when Rousseau finally got some notice. Gordon wrote in his book about modern French painters that these two men were different as night and day. Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make pictures so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy for men like him, men who carry dreams in their pockets like copper pennies, hoping someday they might turn to gold.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Couldn't say why exactly but he reckoned there was something to it. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on some Greek pot, said beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and wrong and what makes something fine to look at, they come from somewhere deeper. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how folk try to explain these things, breaking them down into little pieces like a butcher with a carcass. They'd take apart a painting or a deed and name all its parts but never get to the heart of it. Like that painting of the woman with the strange smile. People talked about light and shadow and history but none of that told you why it made your chest tight to look at it. Most times when you asked someone why they loved some piece of art they'd just say there was something about it, something they couldn't put their finger on. Like trying to describe the taste of water.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things couldn't be told straight out, had to come sideways through a story. No matter how many words you used there was always something left over, something that wouldn't get caught in the net of language. Same with knowing right from wrong. That Austrian fella Wittgenstein said you couldn't even speak it proper, said it was beyond words altogether.\n\nThe connection twixt the two, between what's right and what's beautiful, it lived in that space beyond words. Hit you in a place you couldn't point to, like a ghost touching your heart. Books though, they was different. McKean had it right when he said books was special cause they carried the weight of living in them. Values, he called them. Said that's what made books matter, cause they showed us how to be human in a world that sometimes forgot what that meant.\n\nSitting there in the growing dark he thought on all this. Thought about how some truths was like smoke, visible but impossible to hold. How beauty and goodness was tied together like a knot that couldn't be undone. And maybe that's all any man needed to know.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold beneath a gray sky that hangs like a burial shroud from München to the dark waters of Kiel. A country now but once it was nothing but blood and soil and the ghosts of ancient tribes that walked these grounds. The culture moves like a river through the heart of it all, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds slow and methodical through stone.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself lost to time and the whispers of dead scholars who argued its meaning in candlelit rooms now turned to dust. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians, how they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar knew them too. Called them Germanus in his writings, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Roman boots. Some say the word meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls. Others speak of spears called ger, or the battle cry that split the air like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote more. His words scratched onto parchment in 98 AD telling of a people pure as winter snow, untouched by the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild land of bitter skies and darker hearts? Only those born to it. Only those who knew nothing else.\n\nThe Romans came though. Came and went like storms across the land, taking what they could carry, leading men to die in foreign soil. But they always returned to their marble columns and paved roads, leaving Germania to those who knew its ways. The tribes lived on the edge of empire, trading forest gold and warrior blood, serving in legions not their own while the years turned slow as millstones grinding all to dust.",
            "The play stretched out before him like some vast tapestry of deception and truth woven together in threads of gold and shadow. He watched it unfold in his mind, the way disguise worked its dark magick through the characters like a slow poison or a balm depending on how you held it to the light. Truth was they all wore masks. Every last one of them. And underneath those masks lay other masks still, peeling away layer by layer until what remained was either salvation or damnation.\n\nHe thought about Viola mostly. How she'd shed her woman's skin like a snake in winter, taking on man's flesh not out of want but necessity. The foreign shore had teeth and she knew it. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she'd said, voice already changing like the tide, \"Where lie my maiden weeds.\" Protection, yes. But protection carries its own price.\n\nThe deception worked its way through the story like a dark river cutting through stone. It isolated her from the women, left her adrift in a sea of complications. Olivia's love came at her sideways, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Words thrown like stones across still water. And Orsino with his thousand declarations, never knowing the truth that stood before him in borrowed clothes: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nHe considered how the modern eye might see it different. How deception sometimes forces truth from its hiding place like smoke from a burrow. Olivia's desire for Cesario might mean something deeper, something hidden beneath the surface like old bones in river mud. But more likely it spoke to the foolishness of those who judge by the shell and not the meat within. When Sebastian appeared she transferred her love quick as summer lightning, and Cesario became sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" Simple as that. Clean as a knife cut.\n\nThe truth was masks served their purpose until they didn't. Then they had to fall away like dead skin or they'd grow into the flesh permanent-like, and a person would forget what lay beneath. That was the real danger. Not the wearing but the forgetting.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the dead. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names like cold stones in the mouth. Dust and bones scattered in that hardscrabble land where the empire had come and gone like some dark caravan bearing death in its wagons. But empires aint built on simple things and this was no different. Each colony carved from earth and blood had its own way. Its own truth.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like relics from some forgotten time. The British who came after spoke of it. How the Germans had built schools there. How they had taught them. But in the southwest there was nothing. Just mission houses scattered like broken teeth in a dead mans skull where the churches did what they could with what little they had. The Germans built fine schools there too but they werent for the natives. No. They were for the white children. The settlers children. Their bloodline preserved in brick and mortar while the African children watched from beyond the fence where their futures lay scattered in the dust like spent cartridges.\n\nHe thought about the numbers sometimes. Fifteen thousand whites in the southwest by 1913. More than anywhere else in their African holdings. The climate drew them like flies to meat. Not gentle but livable. Desert stretched its fingers across the land but a man could survive there. Could build something. But what they built was a wall. A wall between knowing and not knowing. Between reading and not reading. Between being and not being.\n\nThe books told it different ways. Most in German text, written when the empire still breathed. Later the English came with their own tellings. Their own comparisons. Cohen wrote of it. How the settlers made the difference. How their presence shaped everything like wind shapes stone. But there was more to it than that. There always is. Dark truths buried in darker soil. Waiting.\n\nIn the east they learned. In the west they didnt. Simple as that but nothing is simple. Nothing at all.",
            "They called it fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three the blood flowed between them like some ancient biblical curse. Two nations locked in their death dance across the desert wastes. America and Mexico. Each carrying their own god in their teeth like mad dogs.\n\nThe war came in forty-six. American boots marking time across Mexican soil while the desert sun watched indifferent and cruel. When it was done Texas lay in American hands and with it the great southwestern wastes. But the blood didnt stop there. It wouldnt stop for years yet.\n\nThey were different peoples carrying different gods. The Americans with their protestant prayers and the Mexicans with their Catholic saints. Like old world hatreds carried across the sea in the holds of wooden ships. The English and Spanish had passed down their ancient feuds like some dark inheritance and now their children played out those old wars in new lands.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those years. Border raids and frontier justice dealing death in small measures. Bandits and outlaws moving like wraiths across the invisible lines men had drawn in the sand. Lines meant nothing to them. They killed and stole and vanished back across the border leaving nothing but ash and bone behind.\n\nThe rivalry died slow like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American gold and the American dream changed from land to commerce. Some things dont die clean. They linger like ghosts haunting the margins of ledger books and trade agreements. The desert remembers though. Every drop of blood spilled there marks the sand forever and the wind carries the memories of dead men in its teeth.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most things that take you down but swift and merciless as a hangman's drop. I didn't even know such afflictions existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd tell you nursing was sure as sunrise. People getting sick and dying, that's what people do. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying. Like making a deal with death himself.\n\nNow here I was. Forty-six years gone from birth, alone in the world save for my affliction, bank account empty as a desert well. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I ever called mine has turned to dust. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and worthlessness. Nothing certain anymore except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth that stands like bedrock: without my blood kin and the few true souls who stayed, I'd have been carried off by the dark waters long ago. When disaster comes it strips you bare, leaves you naked as a newborn in the cold world.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No map shows where they lay waiting. You can fill your storehouse to the rafters but some storms are too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone against the world, like them pioneers who crossed the mountains west. But that ain't the truth of it. What kept them wagon trains rolling wasn't the strength of one man but the bonds between many. Compassion and respect, the sharing of what little they had. Nobody crossed them mountains alone.\n\nSo yes, keep your disaster kit. Stack your canned goods and matches. Lay in water tablets and medical supplies like you're preparing for the end times. Plant your garden if you've got the ground for it. But while you're building your fortress against what's coming, remember this: know your neighbor's face. Learn their story. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't gonna be you alone against it. It'll be all of us or none.",
            "In the old world before the old world there was a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. He walked out of his palace one day and never went back. Found something in himself that wasnt there before. Something that burned like a coal in the deepest part of night. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion he built stands different. Changed. In Sri Lanka they cut the water every year. Some ceremony. Monks in their robes like old ghosts moving through the current. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down to the marrow of what they believe. What they think will save them.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Like a sickness. Some meant harm and others didnt care either way but the changes came all the same. Inside the walls of their temples the monks watched it happen. Outside the merchants and farmers and all manner of men watched too. Some fought it. Others didnt.\n\nAt the heart of it all three things. Buddha himself. The Dhamma which is their holy word written in three parts. The Sangha which is their church if you could call it that. The books tell em what they need to know. How to live. What rules to follow. What lies behind the veil of the world. They say theres no soul. Say life is suffering. Say nothing lasts. Round and round they go dying and being born again until they figure it out. Until they shake off want and hate and being blind to what is real.\n\nThe monks got their rules and the common folk got theirs. Five things they cant do. Cant kill. Cant lie. Cant steal. Cant do wrong with their bodies. Cant poison their minds with drink or worse things. But at the bottom of it all four truths like old stones in a dry riverbed. Life is pain. Want causes pain. Pain can end. Theres a way out if youre strong enough to take it."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Like God maybe. He'd seen it in the way men moved and talked and in their eyes when they looked at you across a table where papers lay waiting to be signed. Papers that meant something to someone somewhere.\n\nThe old man had told him once that you couldn't say what a people were like in just a word or two. Couldn't say the Russians were this way or the Japanese were that way. The old man knew. He'd been there in places where the language was strange and the customs stranger still but he knew that men were men wherever you found them.\n\nWhen you went into another man's country you carried your own country with you whether you meant to or not. Like a shadow that wouldn't leave. You saw things through eyes that had been shaped by your own place and time and there wasn't any helping it.\n\nIn the corporate towers they had their own ways too. Like tribes maybe. Some wore suits that cost more than a working man's monthly wage and some came to work in denims and tshirts. Some wanted you there before the sun came up and some didn't care when you showed up long as the work got done. Each place had its own rules written and unwritten and if you didn't know them you'd find out soon enough.\n\nHe thought about values and what they meant. In some places a man's word was everything and in others it wasn't worth the air it took to speak it. Some cultures valued harmony above all else and would rather lose face than cause discord. Others saw negotiation like war and wouldn't yield an inch without bleeding for it first.\n\nThe key was knowing your man. Not just his culture or his company's ways but knowing him as a man. What he wanted. What he feared. What he'd fight for and what he'd let go. Without that you were just guessing and guessing could get you killed at the negotiating table just as sure as it could in the desert or the mountains where men fought with bullets instead of words.",
            "The fool speaks of godlessness in his heart and darkness follows. Found first in the old psalms and later in Anselm's writings, these words echo through time like footfalls in an empty church. Aquinas too walked these shadowed halls of thought, both men seeking proof of what cannot be touched.\n\nTo speak of their arguments we must accept their God as real and true, the God of scripture and stone tablets, not some nebulous force moving through the void. Their God had a son. Their God had wrath. Their God spoke through burning bushes and parted seas.\n\nAnselm's path leads inward, deep into the chambers of the mind where understanding dwells like a flame in darkness. He would say God exists because we know it in our bones, in the marrow of our thoughts. That you cannot truly imagine His absence any more than you can imagine the absence of truth itself. Faith lives here, in these inner rooms where reason fears to tread.\n\nBut Aquinas walked a different road. He gathered evidence like a man gathering firewood, piece by piece, building his case with cold logic and colder reason. Five proofs he laid out like stones in a path: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and order. Each one leading to God like tracks in the sand lead to the sea. He would say you need no faith when the truth stands before you plain as day. That God can be proven like theorems are proven, with hard facts and harder logic.\n\nYet neither man's path leads all the way home. They are like blind men touching different parts of the same vast beast, each describing only what their hands can reach. One feels the trunk, the other the tusk, but neither sees the whole. The truth of God, if there be such a truth, lies somewhere beyond both faith and reason, in that twilight realm where both paths end and something else begins.",

He used words in ways they weren't meant to be used, pairing them wrong like mismatched horses in a team, but somehow they pulled true. And he took colors and made them mean things they had no business meaning, gold and green and white and gray and red, all of them carrying weight like pack animals bearing loads too heavy for their frames.\n\nThe white and gray they spoke of sameness, of things worn smooth by time and use. White being the color of money and privilege, gray being what white becomes when hope dies. You could see it in how he wrote it. Everywhere white clothes like banners of surrender.

Only at Gatsby's did the colors rage wild and primary like something torn loose from its moorings. The rest was all white chasms in the city and gray names written in gray books and white buildings lined up like headstones. A white girlhood that might never have happened at all. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fell like snow that never melted.\n\nHe used these colors like a man might use a knife, cutting meaning into things. When Daisy came back she was all in white, driving a white car, and you could see then what she was - just another piece in a game being played out.

Fields there were, and orchards, the fruit hanging heavy and low, peaches and lemons both, and berries dark as blood in the morning sun.

The waiting lists for such pure food grew long as scripture, the people hungry for eggs still warm from their laying, milk white as God's own blessing.\n\nThey came to walk these lands, these pilgrims, to witness the workings of soil and seed.

They planted cover crops in the wisdom of their grandfathers, moved their cattle in patterns like old ceremonies, fought back the invasive species that came like thieves in the night.\n\nNear Potrero they found land. One hundred and sixty acres where chaparral met grassland, where oak trees stood sentinel as dark prophets. The Cleveland Forest pressed against it like a ancient wall.

The burrowing owl watched from its underground cathedral, its future uncertain as all futures must be.\n\nBefore the ranchers came with their cattle and their axes, before they felled the trees for cordwood, the Indians had walked these hills. Their ghosts still moved through the oak shadows, their footsteps quiet as falling leaves. The homesteaders came after, their patent on the land a piece of paper that meant everything and nothing. They grazed their cattle and cut their wood and were in turn forgotten.\n\nHe studied the property listings like a man reading auguries, searching for signs in the government programs that might make such a venture possible.

But what difference did it make? He was just words on a page. Just another ghost in a world full of ghosts. Just another story that never got told right.",
            "He watched the news come through the glass eye, the morning light harsh and cold in Columbus. First came word of evil done in Ashley, a man called Hostettler who'd taken blade to wife, the darkness in his eyes staring out from the booking photo like some ancient thing dredged up from below. They gave it two minutes. No more. Just enough to tell of multiple wounds and iron bars that waited.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen summers old and now laid low by gunshot in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The story passed quick as wind through dead grass, like so many tales of the darker folk who fell victim in this godless time. White faces lingered longer on the screen, their stories told and retold until they became legend.\n\nNews of a bullet hole in the flying machine they called Med-Flight. Twenty-two caliber from a rifle, they said. Money offered for the shooter's name, five thousand dollars to break the silence that held his identity like a tomb.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties like restless ghosts. Brief words meant to keep eyes fixed to the screen, bait for the commercial break.\n\nThen robbery at the UDF on Clime Road. They spoke of the thief's blackness like it was a thing you could touch, described his dark skin and hood as if painting some nightmare creature. Six foot tall and lean as a winter wolf. They dwelt on his color like men obsessed with darkness.\n\nLast came word of Rodriguez, the drug lord from Texas. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if counting each month might make the sentence heavier. They named him Hispanic though it mattered not at all to the weight of his crimes or the years that waited to swallow him.\n\nThrough it all the news anchor sat pristine and distant as a priest, passing judgment on the day's sins while outside the real world turned, uncaring and vast beneath an indifferent sky.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand, each figure telling its own tale of worth and loss in the vast wasteland of the market. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing that moved like a serpent through the exchanges, tracking indices and commodities with the cold precision of a predator. Not unlike the mutual funds of old but leaner, meaner, more adapted to survive in these harsh financial climes.\n\nThe boy looked at the figures. What do they mean Papa, he said.\n\nThey mean survival son. A way to spread our chances across the wasteland. Like having many arrows instead of one.\n\nThe numbers showed the truth of it. Ten holdings making up near sixty-four percent of the whole thing. Each one carrying its own weight like pack animals in a caravan across the desert of uncertainty. UnitedHealth Group. CVS Health Corp. Elevance Health. Their percentages written in blood-red ink against the stark white paper.\n\nHe'd done the calculations in the dim light of evening, figures scratched out with a pencil worn nearly to the nub. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, six point eleven percent higher, like a child outgrowing its father. The beta lower by point twelve, as if the offspring had learned to move more cautiously through the financial wilderness.\n\nBut numbers could lie. He knew this like he knew the sound of his own breathing in the dark. Statistical significance hung over the data like a shroud, demanding to be acknowledged. Standard deviations lined up like sentries, each one guarding its own truth about risk and return.\n\nThe market is no country for old men, he thought. It gives no quarter and asks none in return. Each transaction leaving its mark like the fossilized footprints of ancient creatures in stone.\n\nThey sat there in the gathering gloom, father and son, studying the figures as if reading an ancient text that might reveal the secrets of survival in this harsh financial world. The boy looked up at him.\n\nWill it protect us, he said.\n\nYes. If anything can.\n\nBut you're not sure.\n\nNo. I'm not sure. Nothing is sure anymore.\n\nThe numbers stared back at them, cold and unblinking as the eyes of the dead.",
            "The numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month. Just fell away. You could study that Figure 17 til your eyes went dim and still not know the why of it. Winter came hard to them New England grounds like it always did, cold and merciless, and them bicycle riders and walkers just disappeared into whatever shelter they could find. December it was. End of term with its burdens of papers and grades weighing down on everyone like stones. Maybe that commuter log just got lost in the shuffle of things, like so many papers do.\n\nThe holidays came too. Always do. Campus emptied out like a dead town, buildings standing dark and silent against the gray sky. When January dragged itself in, bringing them students and teachers back, weren't many filling out them logs. February was worse. Numbers so low you could count em on one hand. Might be that first fire of excitement just burned itself out, way fires do when there aint nothing left to feed em.\n\nWe tried something then. Called it the Carpool Challenge Week. March it was. Like throwing fresh wood on dying embers, trying to bring that flame back. Worked some. Numbers came up, but they was different somehow. Weaker.\n\nThing about people is they love their cars. Love em like kin. Its in the blood of this country, deep as original sin. We tried to lure em away with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and such. Books too. Even them big store chains. But maybe we should've gone bigger. Bicycle maybe. One of them hybrid cars even. Electric one perhaps. Something to make em sit up and take notice.\n\nThem first prizes worked fine at the start. People's eyes would light up at the mention of em. But they was like giving pennies to a man who needed dollars. If we'd have brought out something bigger in December, maybe one of them bicycles, then come January dropped the news about a car - hybrid or electric, don't matter which - well, might've kept em interested. Might've kept em coming back. Instead of watching em drift away like smoke in that winter wind.",
            "I set to watching them old Edison pictures, them trick films from the turn of the century, fifteen of them laid out before me like cards in some devil's game spanning 1895 to 1901. Strange illusions wrought in silver and light, crafted by men who knew the dark art of cutting and splicing celluloid dreams. They was mostly bound by rules old as theatre itself, rules that grew from the ground like weeds through concrete, choking out any notion of something different.\n\nThey kept their pictures in boxes made of sets and stages, all shot straight on like God himself was watching from the cheap seats. Camera bolted down like it was afraid to move. Everything far off or middling far, never close enough to see a man's soul in his eyes. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. Except when it wasnt.\n\nThe pictures lived in rooms built special for them, rooms with invisible walls facing forward like church pews. Camera didnt follow nothing. It stood there dead still like a hanging judge, watching. This way of doing came down from theatre folk and carnival men who knew about fooling eyes. Characters moved sideways like crabs, never coming forward, never going back. Take that picture Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel. Josh and them others, they shuffle side to side like theyre afraid of something in the deep dark behind the lens.\n\nThey shot everything from far off, sometimes a little closer but never close enough to count teeth. Never saw nobody's eyes up close in them days. Theatre folk taught them that too, keeping everything in view all at once like God intended. Actors stayed back where they belonged, away from the glass eye watching them.\n\nMost times one shot was all there was, one minute of magic before the light died. Wasnt much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and switches, people appearing and vanishing like smoke in wind. But them shots wasnt always what they seemed. Take that old picture of Mary Queen of Scots getting her head cut off. Look close enough and youll see where they stitched the death together, like a butcher hiding the seam in meat.",
            "The Gothic tale aint new and it aint old neither. It's both and that's what Ian Watt called it in his book about such things. Some folks praised it and others cursed it and said it was hollow inside like an old dried gourd left too long in the field. But it had power in it. The kind that makes men shiver and think about what's beyond the dark.\n\nThe first of these tales came from Horace Walpole who wrote about a castle and things that happened there. He took old things and new things and mixed them together like a man might mix water and whiskey, knowing neither one alone would do what he needed. The story he made was full of old stone and older shadows, full of things from medieval times when men built great towers that reached up toward God like the fingers of dead men reaching through dirt.\n\nIn them days the word gothic meant different things to different folk. Some thought it meant barbarians and others thought it meant them pointed arches in old churches where the light comes down in dusty beams like God's own fingers touching earth. Most folk thought it was something dead and gone, like bones bleaching in the sun. But Walpole, he took that dead thing and breathed life into it, made it walk again.\n\nThe heart of these tales was something called chivalry. Not the kind where men open doors for women but the old kind, where knights rode out into the dark carrying steel and faith like twin flames against the night. Walpole saw his own time was missing something. Something important that had gotten lost like a coin dropped in tall grass. He was living in troubled times when men's hearts had gone cold and their honor had dried up like creek beds in summer.\n\nIn his tale there's a man called Frederic who carries the old ways in him like embers in ash. Before you even meet him you know what he is. A prince who's suffered and bled and been thought dead at the hands of heathens. He's what knights was supposed to be, though Walpole made him larger than life, like a shadow cast by candlelight that stretches tall against a wall.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to finished goods it winds its way across the land leaving tracks of commerce in its wake. Oliver found it first back in 82, gave it a name though it had existed long before any man thought to call it such. Six parts to the beast: the making and the getting, the keeping and the placing, the moving and the knowing. All of it bound together like vertebrae in some ancient creature's spine.\n\nThe making comes first. Always has. Always will. Must know what's needed fore you can birth it into being. The market speaks if you know how to listen, tells you what folk hunger for in their bones. Managers stand like prophets reading signs in the wind, counting volume and quality like priests counting sacrificial lambs. Choose wrong and the whole thing falls to dust and ash. Seen it before in them big box stores where I done my time. Walmart. Target. Each one with their own scripture writ down in manuals thick as bibles, telling how every little thing ought be done from the way a man wears his clothes to how the trucks get emptied of their guts.\n\nThe getting comes next. Strategic they call it, like generals planning war. Deciding what each place can do best, what parts to keep close and what to send out to others. Sometimes you got to spread the work around, let other outfits take their piece. They call it velocity when they do that, though it ain't about speed so much as it's about being nimble while keeping the coin in your pocket. Like a man trying to dance quick without spilling his whiskey.\n\nEach facility stands like its own fortress. Got its own soldiers with their own weapons, each one knowing their part in the greater war of commerce. Management looks down from high walls deciding where the strength lies, where the weakness shows. Sometimes they send the work away, let other armies fight them battles. All of it moving like blood through veins, keeping the great beast alive.",
            "The books of that age bore the weight of detail like ornate Victorian mansions, all finery and aristocratic airs. But there were two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These carried something else in them. Something raw. Something that crept through the pages like a night-thing, unnamed and watchful. Mystery lived in their bones and the peculiar haunted their margins and this strangeness gave their people flesh and blood and hearts that beat true.\n\nThere was a passage where the boy Oliver walked in darkness. He moved between Sikes and Crackit like a ghost might walk between two demons arguing in hell. Their voices came to him across some vast distance though they stood at his shoulders. Then gunfire split the night and screaming rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights bloomed in the dark. Pain lived in him then, deep and constant as breathing. Some unseen hand bore him away through this fever-dream of blood and noise and he could not fight it. Could not even try.\n\nThese nightmares they wrote into their books served different purposes but all showed the truth that lived beneath. In Oliver's tale they revealed what lay coiled in his heart, what ate at him in the dark hours, what whispered to him about the true nature of things. When they shot the boy and he relived it later it came back like a tide of darkness. No control did he have then. No power over his own destiny. The pain had made its home in him by then, wed to fear rather than shock. And through it all ran the question of whose will had brought him to this place, for surely it was not his own. The old jew Fagin had begun his work by then, breaking the boy piece by piece until despair became as natural as breathing. Even with death at his heels Oliver could not fight. Could not even try to save himself.\n\nThe day that followed was no day at all but merely night's brief absence. Then true night came again, somehow endless in its terrible silence yet fleeting in its hours, as if time itself had gone mad in the darkness.",
            "There was a time I worked with the young ones, after their schooling was done for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy named Adrian, dark eyes and quiet like they sometimes are. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters all scattered in his mind like windblown leaves. Some he knew true and others might as well have been marks made by birds in the dust.\n\nHe spoke the English good enough. Clean and clear like any American child. Latino blood in him sure but you'd never know it from his speech. We worked at it, him and me, day after day until his mother came. It was during a field trip day and I was watching the ones left behind. She came in speaking no English at all. Just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor, broken things really, but we made do. And then I knew. Knew it like you know the coming of winter. The boy could read fine enough. Just not in English. The letters were foreign to him like tracks in the snow.\n\nThe language wall stands high in these schools. Higher in California than most places. Sometimes you cant even see it until youre right up on it. Even those that speak the English perfect as morning light, reading it can be like crossing a river in flood. Everyone knows this truth but knowing aint fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him the letters. Show him the sounds they make. But for the others, the ones who barely know English at all, theres no simple answer. Dual language. Immersion. Special teachers. ESL. None of these alone will do it. You need them all together like fingers making a fist.\n\nThe dual language way, thats something worth considering. Not just for the Spanish speakers but all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folk fear it. Say its wasteful. Say it wont help the majority. But thats not true. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all rise. Dont need every teacher speaking both tongues. That aint realistic. But having some that do, special helpers who know both worlds, that might be the way. Might be the only way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant know with your mind. Some go to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some go elsewhere and some just look inside themselves til their eyes go dark with looking. Most take what their people gave them like a worn coat passed down. Others spit on it all and say theres nothing but what they can hold in their own two hands. We take up one way of seeing then trade it for another like old coins we found in the dirt. No matter. We all walk that same road looking for that thing bigger than ourselves. Looking for some light in all that dark to lead us home.\n\nPapa set in that old chair on the porch, rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Sound like gravel in a metal drum. We smoked together and watched the rain drown them flowers along the porch edge where the gutters spilled. Asked him what bird he liked best and he said Cardinal and then he just stared out into that rain. Looking and not looking. Clothes hanging off him like someone elses skin. Hair thin now where it used to be thick. He wouldnt look at me and I couldnt speak the words that needed speaking. Words about missing and about loss. Speaking them would make the loss more real somehow. More final. I moved my chair closer to his. Hugged him once. Then we just watched that June rain come down in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twentytwo. They gave him radiation and poison to fight the thing growing inside him but it just made him suffer longer. I lay in bed nights asking what sort of God would do such a thing. No prayers came. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didnt watch him go. Didnt want to see the life that made my life drain away like water in sand. Wanted to remember him living not dying. Known him better than any of them anyway. Known he wouldnt want his boy watching death take him. So I curled up in my bed like some hurt animal and waited three days for word.\n\nWord never came.",
            "The man they called John Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his plantation with purpose, knowing in his bones what the land could teach about freedom and governance. He was a farmer first and always would be, though the affairs of men had pulled him brief into their politics. The soil spoke to him of sovereignty and justice and the rights of men to work the earth as they saw fit.\n\nHe saw America raw and new like fresh-plowed ground, unencumbered by the dead weight of tradition that plagued the old world. Here was earth waiting to be seeded with self-governance. He knew about rights. Natural rights. How they tangled together like roots in rich soil, one failing and all failing, withering under the boot of government overreach. These were things no man should touch.\n\nThe state of nature, some called it. Taylor knew better. Knew how the strong and cunning would always prey upon the weak without the structures of civilization to bind them. But civilization itself was a double-edged blade.\n\nHe believed men carried both light and dark within them, good principles and bad bound together like wheat and chaff. Good principles protected what a man owned, nurtured the land, kept the money-changers at bay. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but it turned poison when it led to parasitic sub-societies feeding off the public good.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time he called for strict adherence to the Constitution, wanted federal power bound tight as a starving dog. He'd seen how bloated government bred despotism like flies on carrion. But simple reading of law wasn't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who wrote it. The Declaration, that was the true charter. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation bound in iron chains of central control.\n\nHe knew these things bone-deep, like he knew the feel of soil crumbling between his fingers. The truth of it was in the land itself, in the sweat and toil of honest work. Everything else was just words floating away on the wind.",
            "He stood there watchin the brown mass in the water below. Silent. Studying it with a detachment that came from years of such work. Thoughts like autumn leaves blown across an empty lot, there and gone again. His mind moved like water over stone, smooth and without purchase.\n\nHe remembered the art book. Some woman had give it to him years ago when he was still dreamin of bein an artist. Said it would teach him bout seein things proper. How to frame em up in your mind. Make em simpler. But there wasnt nothin simple about what he was lookin at now. No frame could contain it. Just stood there like a man before some terrible altar, his green tie hangin down like a hanged mans tongue.\n\nIf them old painters had their colors then this here was his. His testimony. His offering to whatever god watched over such things. Brown and perfect in its way. Like some cosmic joke played out in porcelain.\n\nHis hand found the handle. Pulled it. Watched the water swirl and eddy, clear as mountain stream water. The mass broke apart some but wouldnt go. Like it had made some covenant with the bowl. He flushed again. And again. Each time watchin the water rise and fall like the breath of some sleepin beast.\n\nFinally he reached for the paper. Started wrappin his hand like them ancient peoples wrapped their dead. Layer after layer till his hand was swaddled in white. A priest preparin for some unholy sacrament. He bent at the waist, his arm descendin slow into them cool waters like a man reachin down into hell itself to shake hands with the devil.\n\nThe fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Silent witnesses to this ritual played out in a Rite Aid bathroom on some nameless Tuesday in a world that had long since stopped carin about such things. About the men who cleaned up after it. About anything at all.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers but the dead speak nothing of their passing. The National Institutes say the young brain aint ready, like green wood that wont take a proper shape no matter how you work it. Inexperience kills them sure as any bullet. Their vehicles roll and speed and leave the road like wild things seeking their own destruction.\n\nWhen they gather they die together. Like moths to flame. The California men who study such things showed it plain as day in their charts and papers. Numbers that tell of dead children stacked like cordwood.\n\nThe state men made their laws. Papers that say when the young ones can drive and who they can carry. As if paper could stop death. But these are just words written in offices by men who've forgotten what it was to be young and wild and immortal.\n\nEven eighteen's too young says the doctor Zuckerman who studies such things. They seek the thrill like animals seeking water in drought, he says. They cant help themselves no more than a wolf can help howling at the moon. Wait till the blood cools, he says. Wait till they aint so ready to die.\n\nMore are coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they was reaching for loaded guns. By 2010 theyll flood the roads like water breaking through a dam. Death rides shotgun with them all.\n\nThe fix aint hard to see though men make it seem so. Keep them learning in their schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen's past. Let them practice with their elders watching. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows death's way. Make it the same in every state cause death dont care about state lines.\n\nSome will say this aint new thinking. And they'd be right. Truth rarely is. But the dead dont care about new or old. They just stay dead all the same.",
            "The boy looked up at him and asked what was wrong with people who couldn't hear right. Not deaf folk, he said, but them that hear wrong somehow. The man studied the ashen sky before speaking.\n\nThey call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, he said. CAPD. Where your ears work fine but your brain cant make sense of what it hears. Like trying to read tracks in the sand after the wind's got to them.\n\nThe boy thought about this. But they can hear?\n\nYes, the man said. They hear but the sounds get twisted somehow. Like looking through dirty glass. Everything's there but nothing's clear.\n\nThey sat watching the dead leaves scatter across the broken parking lot. The man remembered doctors from before. Men in white coats with clipboards who'd study children like they were reading maps to some foreign country. Testing them. Making them listen to sounds and words that came through headphones like distant echoes. Started back in the fifties, he said. Italian doctors. They'd put different words in each ear and watch what happened.\n\nHow do you know if someone has it?\n\nSometimes they cant tell where sounds come from. Like they're lost in space. Sometimes words get jumbled up. Or they cant hear someone talking if there's other noise. Like their brain cant sort out what's important.\n\nThe boy picked up a stick and drew in the dust. What happens to them?\n\nThey need help, the man said. Used to be teachers would know what to do. Special ways of teaching. Special places to sit in class. But that was before. Before all this.\n\nHe gestured at the wasteland around them. The boy nodded, understanding more than he should have to. They sat in silence for a while, listening to the wind move through the dead city.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he was sixteen and afraid and his eyes darted like small animals in a trap. He'd fled from them that raised him, them that should have loved him but didn't. I watched him there and knew what I had to do.\n\nYears before I'd walked the halls of learning seeking knowledge of the mind and its workings. Studied the way folk cope with the darkness in them or flee from it or deny it altogether. Got my papers in Psychology but still the path ahead was dark and unknown like a road at night with no stars to guide by.\n\nThe next day I went to where his people lived. The police were there already, standing in the yard like sentinels in blue. I told them what I knew, told them of my learning in the ways of the mind. They bid me speak to the parents, said the law's hands were tied in such matters. The mother and father spoke in circles, nervous words about their boy being manipulative, about simple disputes made large. But their eyes told different tales. I knew then what I must become.\n\nJustice is a thing we speak of but seldom see. We claim to value the singular soul but we make all souls alike, press them into shapes acceptable to the many. In my younger days I raged against this with wild-colored hair and metal in my flesh and clothes that spoke my truth. Stood with those that society cast aside - the different ones, the ones that loved different from the rest. Fought the old hatreds wherever I found them.\n\nNow I aim to help the lost ones, the broken ones. To work with those cast aside by their own blood. My values are hewn from stone: service to others, respect for their dignity, truth in all dealings. These aren't just words but the very marrow of who I am. The path ahead is clear now, like a road at dawn with the sun rising blood-red in the east. I'll walk it and help who I can along the way.",
            "He set the papers down before him and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and the wanting of it. The darkness that comes unbidden or not at all. He knew these things. The old doctors with their studies and their microscopes looking for answers in the brains of mice while all around them the world burned away to ash.\n\nThey called it insomnia but that word was just a marker for something deeper and more terrible. Something that lived in the blood and bones of men. In their very cells. The hypothalamus with its secret languages of sleep and waking. Neurons firing or not firing. The terrible democracy of consciousness that gave no quarter and took no prisoners.\n\nHe thought about the mice in their cages. The scientists watching them through glass walls while strange chemicals coursed through their blood. GABAB receptors. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice slept or didn't sleep and men wrote down numbers in ledgers and thought they understood something about the night.\n\nBut there were other truths. Darker ones. The kind that lived in the spaces between people. In their histories and their bloodlines. In the weight of generations. Sleep disorders they called them. As if disorder wasnt the natural state of things. As if order was something more than a temporary rebellion against chaos.\n\nThe sociocultural model. The biological model. Words that tried to explain why some men slept while others lay awake counting their breaths in the dark. But they were just words. The truth was in the darkness itself. In the terrible silence between heartbeats. In the long hours before dawn when a man could feel the weight of all his ancestors pressing down on him like stones.\n\nHe thought about the people who couldn't sleep. How they moved through the world like ghosts. How their days bled into their nights until time itself became meaningless. School. Work. The rituals of the living. All of it just shadows on the wall of a cave that got deeper and darker with each passing hour.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like a slow river through the valley of days. When I first come here they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of everything where the wind blows cold and merciless across empty fields. Beyond lay only the stadium and the center they call Bryce Jordan, standing like ancient monuments to some forgotten civilization.\n\nThe walk from Stuart Hall to Willard building was a pilgrimage through wasteland, twenty-five minutes if the weather held, longer when the sky turned black and the rain came sideways like it does in State College. An old timer told me once how East Halls used to stand alone out there, separated from everything by dead ground that stretched on forever. Now they've filled it all in. Sports fields. New buildings risen up like concrete monoliths. The Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks circled round like wagons against the night.\n\nThe campus grows like some mindless thing, devouring space, making distance where there was none before. But there's an answer to this vastness. The bicycle. Simple as scripture. Mechanical and true. Though the machine itself aint worth nothing without riders to push the pedals, and paths to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years away from it. Said he couldn't recollect why he ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, like he'd discovered some profound truth written in steel and rubber. And he wasnt wrong. Bowl of oatmeal and muscle gets you thirty miles. Maybe more.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dorm. Got myself a bike. Best decision I ever made in this place. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minute walk but five minutes riding if you're willing to push. Pollock Road's the straightest shot but it aint always favorable. Could walk, I suppose, if I was of a mind to waste time. But time's a currency I cant afford to spend. Thirty minutes extra each way. Two and a half hours gone each week, vanished like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's too precious for that kind of waste.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was to come. A world of machines and men who were no longer men. The book spoke of a controller who watched over all things like some dark god. In this world there was no love. No hatred neither. Just the endless consumption of things that meant nothing at all.\n\nThe people there were born into their stations like cattle bred for slaughter. Each one marked from birth to serve their purpose and nothing more. They called it conditioning but it was slavery plain and simple. The lower orders knew nothing of their chains. Kept docile with drugs and empty pleasures while those above them pulled the strings.\n\nHe thought about how the classes moved among each other like ghosts. No true touching. No true knowing. The men spoke of women like they were things made of air and flesh and nothing more. Pneumatic was the word they used. As if the curves of a woman's body were something to be measured like tire pressure. The women no better. Speaking of their couplings like discussing the weather or what they had for breakfast.\n\nEach class stayed in its place like layers in a cake gone stale. The high born alphas and betas looking down from their towers while the others scurried below. All of them prisoners though most didnt know it. Kept in line with promises of happiness that was no happiness at all. Just pleasure without meaning. Without cost. Without pain.\n\nThe controller stood above it all like some dark spider in its web. Watching. Waiting. Feeding them all the same sweet poison that kept them docile and consuming and believing they were free when they were anything but. A machine built of flesh and bone and blood that ground on and on toward nothing at all except its own perpetuation.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark thinking about how the world was headed down that same road. How men were becoming less than men. How love was dying. How the things that made us human were being stripped away one by one until nothing would be left but the hollow shell of what we once were. And he knew that this was what the writer had seen coming all those years ago. This was what he had tried to warn us about. But who would listen. Who would care. Who would even understand.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room learning of Islam and its ways. The question hung heavy in the air like smoke, whether this faith carried violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, watching the world turn and darken since them towers fell. The papers and screens that once spoke with venom against the faithful now bend backwards in tolerance, as if afraid of their own shadow. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, with Islam running through his blood like a dark river, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me some. What they write of him and what history shows stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a dusty street. In my mind I see him as he was, sword in hand, forcing men to kneel and accept his truth or taste steel. Yet here in these pages he walks soft, humble as a child, drawing men to him like moths to flame. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, bearing his burden in silence while truth worked its way through men's hearts.\n\nThere's something that ain't right about how they mirror the Christ's works in Muhammad's deeds. They tell of him making meat and milk stretch beyond nature's bounds, feeding forty men where there was food for few. It reads false, like a man trying to wear another's skin. They diminish the true miracle of Jesus, stealing his glory to dress their prophet in borrowed light.\n\nThe stories they tell come handed down through too many mouths, like water poured from cup to cup until you can't trust what's left. This man told that man who heard from another - truth gets thin when stretched so far. They mean it as proof but it reads like smoke and mirrors, each telling making the tale more suspect.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is how they fashion him gentle and wise, a shepherd leading his flock with soft words and softer heart. But history speaks different. It speaks of blood and steel and conquest. Sometimes I wonder if the faithful today know the truth of it, or if they too believe in this phantom prophet, this ghost of gentleness that never was.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like dead leaves in the wind that followed. If you were to stand upon some high place and look down across the vastness of time you'd see how the truth of it all just kept moving further and further away like some dream you cant quite remember when you wake. These days there's a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasn't there before. The old ones who cling to what their fathers told them and their fathers before them still remain but they're getting fewer, like dying embers in a cold hearth.\n\nAmong them that call themselves Christian there's going to be an awakening. Like water rising slow and steady in some ancient well. They'll start peeling away at what men added to the words. Layer by layer. Year by year. Maybe it'll take generations but it'll come sure as night follows day. The clock of time spinning backwards until there aint nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about God.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the white man it'll wash clean the churches but wont destroy them. They'll still stand like weathered sentinels. But something strange will happen. All them differences between believers will start fading away like footprints in the sand when the tide comes in. History's got a way of turning back on itself. Like how Rome went from killing Christians to bowing before their cross. Or how this country went from keeping men in chains to letting them lead.\n\nYou go back far enough and there was just the Jews. That's where it all started. Before Christ walked the earth they had their one God and their holy books and their laws handed down since Moses' time. Back when Rome took Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ the Jews weren't of one mind neither. They had their divisions. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. And then there was just the common folk, carrying their beliefs like stones in their pockets, wearing them smooth with worry and wonder.",
            "They was greed in them and it was a thing that could not be denied nor cast out. Like some darkness that dwelled in the heart of man since time was time. The Jungle showed this truth plain as day. Showed it in the way men conducted their affairs and in the way they turned their eyes from the suffering of others like it was nothing to them at all.\n\nThe factory men stood highest among these. Lords of their concrete kingdoms rising black against the sky, smoke pouring forth like the breath of some industrial beast. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing against the heavens, smoke streaming endless to the edge of the world as if God himself had blessed their venture. But there was no blessing in it. Only the slow poisoning of everything that drew breath.\n\nThey cared nothing for the workers that made their fortunes. Nothing for the men and women broken on the wheels of progress. The whole of Packingtown was nothing but a cauldron of hate and desperation where a man's worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. They'd lay off hundreds without warning, casting them into the streets like so much offal. No law stood between the workers and their masters in them days. No protection from the speed-ups and the dangerous machines and the bone-grinding labor that left men dead before their time.\n\nThe people who lived and died there had no choice but to endure. Like chattel they was, bound to the factories by hunger and desperation. Foreign folks mostly, hanging by a thread over starvation's abyss, their fates tied to the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And like slavery it bred a particular kind of darkness in the soul. A corruption that spread through them streets like a disease, touching everything it encountered. Making monsters of men who might otherwise have been decent folk.\n\nThem factory owners stood atop it all like kings of old, counting their money while below them the masses suffered. They breathed different air than the working folk. Ate different food. Their children played in parks while the children of the workers played in gutters filled with offal and blood from the killing floors. That was the way of it. The natural order they'd created, as merciless as nature herself.",
            "In the darkened corridors of literary history there was a poem called Dream-land and Poe had writ it and called it among his finest works. The word Thulé lay buried in its verses like some ancient rune, appearing twice as though summoned from older tongues. Mabbott traced it back to Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, an isle north of Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there were other wells from which such waters might have sprung.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like cold iron striking flame in the darkness of his thoughts. Goethe chief among them, his Faust a thing of terrible beauty published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in the year of his death, 1832. Within that second part lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed leaving him naught but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep of both till at last he cast the cup into the sea and followed after, his eyes closing on the world forever.\n\nThe shadows between these works ran deep as wells. Dream-land and The King of Thulé stood as mirror-dark reflections, each echoing loss and loneliness and the color leaching out of all things. The speaker in Dream-land walked as though he'd stepped into Goethe's world itself, seeing what that ancient king had seen, feeling what he had felt in those last moments on the cliff's edge.\n\nGoethe's name carried weight that even Poe could not ignore. When asked of Tennyson, Poe spoke of both men in the same breath, their words carrying across oceans and years in endless adaptations and tellings. The darkness in their verses called to his own, and in Dream-land that darkness found its echo, twice-told and terrible in its beauty.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that October evening eating his dinner while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold linoleum like some pale viscous blood. First came Wayne telling him of the danger and then Haddigan but he paid them no mind. The food was warm in his mouth and he had no time for such things. No time at all.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five walking the fluorescent aisles like a pilgrim in some retail wasteland. She didnt see the spill. How could she. The floor was slick and treacherous and she went down hard onto the tiles, her spine cracking like green wood in winter. Behind the security cameras watched with their dead glass eyes recording everything and nothing.\n\nThere had been others before her. Five souls who'd fallen in that same store that year alone. Their bodies hitting the floor like sacks of wet cement. Each time the manager had known. Each time he had chosen to look away. The law called it conscious disregard but it was something older than that. Something primitive and dark that lived in the spaces between duty and indifference.\n\nIn California the statutes spoke of punitive damages for acts committed with oppression fraud or malice. Cold words for cold deeds. The courts had ruled on such things before. They knew malice when they saw it. Knew it in the willful turning away from consequence. Knew it in the deliberate blindness to the rights of others. The manager had seen the danger coming like storm clouds on the horizon but he had chosen to let it come. Let whatever would happen happen.\n\nThe judge would have to look at it now. Would have to weigh the despicable nature of it. Six people fallen. Six bodies broken on his watch. The manager sitting in his office that evening spooning food into his mouth while danger waited in the aisles like some patient predator. No. This wasnt something that could be dismissed with the wave of a gavel. The malice lay there as plain as the spilled applesauce on the store floor. As plain as the broken woman who now sought her justice.",
            "The wanting had been there since she was fourteen. A hollow thing that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone now and still it gnawed at her like some dark beast crouched in the chambers of her heart. Not a thing she needed but someone. The boys came and went like pale ghosts. Their awkward advances met with silence. She studied herself in the mirror nights, questioning what darkness lay within that made her this way. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her mother and father walked soft through the rooms like spirits themselves, rarely raising voices against each other or their daughter save when she blazed forth with that wild fire that burned in her. A fire they hadnt known the source of. She carried it like a torch through the world and folk were drawn to its light.\n\nBut this day the quiet broke. A scream tore through the morning air from the kitchen where her mother stood. The girl ran. Mama she called. Mama what is it. Her mother lay twisted on the tile floor making small animal sounds of pain. The girl knelt beside her and laid hands on her mothers shoulder. Hospital the mother said through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like a child, grateful for the strength in her arms, and carried her through the door to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of spirits and sick folk and death but she paid it no mind. Carried her mother through the sliding doors calling out for help in a voice that echoed off the sterile walls. White coats descended like vultures. They took her mother away on a rolling bed and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps.\n\nLater they told her how her mother had fallen reaching for some old pottery piece high up in the kitchen cabinets. As if such things mattered now. As if anything mattered but the soft rise and fall of her mothers chest in the hospital bed. The girl sat vigil through the night watching. Watching and waiting while outside the window the world spun on uncaring through the dark.",
            "They sought to know of hearts and their failings and of the old ways of eating that might keep a man from the darkness that comes with disease. The Mediterranean way they called it though it wasnt really about the sea at all but about the things that grew from the earth and the creatures that swam in those waters. The old people who lived there knew things about food that the modern world had forgotten. They ate the fruits of trees and grains from the field and fish from the waters and they drank wine in moderation as men have done since time out of mind.\n\nThey watched seventy four thousand women for twenty years. Nurses they were all of them. Each two years time they would write down what they ate and what they drank and the watchers would give them numbers based on how close they kept to the old ways. The women grew older. Some sickened and died. Some had their hearts give out and some had their minds stolen by clots in their brains that came silent and terrible in the night.\n\nThe watchers kept their vigil through all those years marking down in their books when one would fall. They checked the death papers and the hospital records and sometimes even the cut flesh itself to be certain of what had taken each one. When they could not be certain they marked it probable and kept counting anyway for that was all they could do.\n\nThey found that those who kept closest to the old ways were less likely to be taken. The numbers showed it clear as day. Of those who ate as their ancestors had eaten only seventy one of every hundred suffered what the others did. The rest were spared though no one could say why exactly. Perhaps it was the earth itself protecting those who still remembered how to eat of it properly. Perhaps it was something else entirely. Something older. Something that had been waiting in the blood since before men knew how to write such things down.\n\nThe numbers told their story but numbers are just shadows on paper and paper burns and shadows fade and in the end all that remains is what was and what wasnt and the long dark road between the two.",
            "The sign said Hitler lived in Burma and the girl held it overhead like some proclamation of doom. She stood alone on that corner in the gray morning light, the cardboard sign stark against the pallid sky. The words were writ in black marker, crude and prophetic.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of old temples and new terrors where men in olive drab had seized power years past, their rifles still warm from the taking. The monks came first in their robes color of flame and sunset. Saffron Revolution, they named it. As if revolution could be distilled to mere color. The people followed after, drawn to the monks like moths to fire until the streets filled with their prayers and their rage.\n\nThe junta watched and waited. Patient as serpents. Then they struck. They came in the night for the monasteries, boots on ancient stone, rifle butts splintering temple doors that had stood centuries. They gathered the foreign press like cattle, herded them into cells. One Japanese man lay dead in the street, his camera still clicking its last frames as his blood spread black on the pavement. Thirteen dead said the papers. But the colonel who fled spoke of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle. The earth drinks deep of such offerings.\n\nIt was nothing new under the sun. Since men first built walls they sought to rule what lay within them. Roman emperors crowned themselves with divinity. Japanese kings claimed celestial birth. Even now our leader takes counsel from prophets of folly, their words carried on wires across the continent like the muttering of ghosts.\n\nThe dead keep their own accounts. In China they gathered in the square that June, students and workers crying freedom into the dawn until the tanks came grinding through the night. Two hundred said the state. Three thousand said the truth. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, neighbor against neighbor until the streets ran red. And before them all came Hitler with his camps and his chambers and his dream of racial purity bought with smoke and ash.\n\nThe girl stood holding her sign. The wind moved her hair. Above, the sky threatened rain. Some truths cant be buried, no matter how deep you dig the grave.",
            "He sat at that piano like a man possessed of something darker than mere talent. The legacy of Duke Ellington aint just in the years he spent making that music but in how he shaped and molded them players like clay in his hands. His own playing was quiet. Subtle. Like whispers in the night. But when he wrote them pieces they came out rich and complex as blood, each one crafted special for them men who played em.\n\nHe knew what each man could do. Knew it deep in his bones. Built frameworks where they could blow free as birds but then hed write these tight orchestrated parts that called on what was particular to each player. Something in their soul that needed telling. The whole orchestra had a sound like nothing else in this world. Original. Pure. Each piece different but carrying that same blood through its veins.\n\nTake that Creole Love Call. Voice used like any other instrument might be. No words to get in the way of what needed saying. Six parts to it like this:\n\nFirst theres that call and response tween voice and reeds. Smooth at first then turning rough like old leather. Then comes a muted trumpet crying out blue notes that'd break your heart. High clarinet floating over piano next, then the whole band taking up that first theme again. Fifth part building like a storm with them reeds calling high and brass answering like thunder. Last part going back to where it started, voice turning to something else entirely. Something that growled like some night creature. Brief ending like a whispered goodbye.\n\nHot and Bothered came later. Miley on that muted trumpet speaking back and forth with Baby Cox's voice, neither one quite human nor quite instrument but something in between. It Don't Mean a Thing brought Nanton in, man they called Tricky Sam, working that trombone like it was speaking in tongues.\n\nThis was the sound of something being born in American music. Something that hadnt been there before and wouldnt never be there quite the same way again. Dark and beautiful and terrible all at once. Like watching the sun go down on the last day of the world.",
            "He sat there studying the shell like some ancient thing pulled from the earth's deep memory. The whorl of it spiraling through time and space like the thoughts of dead men. Like the thoughts of God himself. The columella running through its heart like a spine, each turn marking the passage of time in calcium and death. He knew there were laws to such things. Mathematical certainties that men like Thompson had tried to capture with numbers and equations back in 1917 though they might as well have been trying to measure the soul.\n\nThe shell lay there in the pale light. Its aperture gazing up like some blind eye, each whorl growing larger as it spiraled outward from that first beginning, that point where life had started its slow accretion of being. The sutures between each turn marked clear as property lines on some dead man's map. Body whorl fat and final like the period at the end of a death sentence.\n\nHe turned it in his hands. Apical view showing the spiral from above, then basal, then apertural with its opening like a mouth frozen mid-speech. Could count the whorls if you knew how. Draw a line through its heart and follow the spiral out, marking quarter turns like time on some cosmic clock.\n\nThe trajectory of it all could be mapped. Could be measured and marked with numbers that meant something to men who believed such things could be contained in mathematics. But he knew better. Knew that evolution moved like water over stone, wearing away at the edges of possibility until something new emerged from the darkness. Like those Prunum shells they studied with their X-rays and computers, trying to divine the boundaries of what could be from what was.\n\nThe shell sat heavy in his hand. Each whorl a perfect geometric progression through space, each turn following laws old as stone. Laws that men like Stone tried to capture in programs like CerioShell, thinking they could model life's possibilities like architects planning cities. But the truth was in the shell itself. In the cold calcium spiral that had once housed life, now empty as a desert church.\n\nHe set it down gentle as laying a child to rest. The mathematics of it all meant nothing really. Just men trying to measure the immeasurable, to contain the infinite in finite terms. The shell would keep its secrets. Would stay mute as bone while men scratched equations in the dust, trying to understand why life moves as it does through the long dark of time.",
            "They sat there in the dim light of the office studying the numbers on the page. Numbers that told of death. Of children lost. Of mothers gone. Indonesia. A place far off where the sun rose first and where death stalked the villages and towns like some dark specter that would not rest.\n\nTen years gone and nothing changed. The dying went on. While some things got better like water and ways to keep clean the children kept dying and the mothers too. Too many to count. Too many to bear. He looked at the paper again. The reasons written there in black ink that told nothing of the truth of it.\n\nSeventy-two percent they said. Birth helpers there to catch the babies as they came into the world. But these weren't doctors. Just women who knew the old ways. When the blood came they could do nothing but watch it flow. Watch the mothers slip away into that dark country from which no traveler returns.\n\nIn the cities things were better. Seven births cut from the belly for every hundred. In the country only two. The numbers told their own story. The rich lived. The poor died. Twenty-seven percent difference between them that had and them that didn't. Money bought life. Always had.\n\nHe thought about the programs they wanted to build. Vertical they called them. Like towers reaching up into nothing. But you couldn't build towers without foundations and the foundations weren't there. The system was broken. Had always been broken. Would stay broken until someone fixed it proper.\n\nThey'd seen it before. Money flowing like water into one thing. AIDS they called it. Death by another name. While the family planning dried up and blew away like dust in the wind. People followed the money. Always had. Always would. Made more paperwork. More forms. More ways to count the dead.\n\nThe numbers stared back at him from the page. Cold. Implacable. Like the eyes of something that lived in the deep dark places of the earth. Something that fed on suffering. On death. On the tears of mothers holding their dead children. He folded the paper and put it away. Some things you couldn't fix with numbers. Some things you couldn't fix at all.",
            "The dark waters of popular music run deep and cold now, deeper than any man could count in years. A hundred winters have passed and still the genres multiply like vermin in the night, breeding new forms that crawl forth into the light. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each one spawning bastard children of their own, sub-genres writhing beneath sub-genres until the names mean nothing at all.\n\nBut it was Heavy Metal that grew the blackest roots, spreading like some malignant vine through forty years of American soil. They say it speaks in tongues of darkness, voices that carry pain and rage and something older still. Something that was there before the music, before the instruments, before the men who played them.\n\nThe metal came like a storm in the night and when it passed nothing was the same. Men took what they found in its wake and forged new sounds, hammered them into shapes that had no names. Now the metal runs in so many streams that no man can say where one ends and another begins. To know the truth of it you got to go back to the source, back to where it first came bubbling up from the ground like black oil.\n\nMetal carries darkness in its bones. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the strings, more blood in the throat of every singer. These weren't no primitive howlers neither. These were craftsmen who knew their tools like a hunter knows his rifle. And there were drugs too, oh yes. Mid-seventies saw a flood of chemicals that turned men's minds inside out, made them see things that weren't there and hear music that hadn't existed before. They blamed it on the drugs but the darkness was in them all along, waiting.\n\nThe old music had been afraid to look into that darkness. But metal stared right into it, reached in and pulled out something raw and bleeding. Like them old Romantic composers who wrote about death and devils, only now it came through amplifiers tall as men, through speakers that could shatter glass. Even the Beatles caught that fever. Their song Helter Skelter came crawling out like something born in a cave, all teeth and hunger. They'd heard what the Stones were doing and wanted to prove they could swim in those same black waters. They did too, though some say that's where the trouble started.",
            "He came before them all, before them dreampainters with their wild visions, Henri Rousseau crafting his own dreams both in sleep and wake. The Dream they called it, made in 1910, showing a woman laid bare in wonderment at some savage paradise, but it was Rousseau's own dreaming too that lived there on that canvas. Recognition he sought, acceptance from them that made art and them that loved it, but the path to such things was dark and winding and full of thorns.\n\nThe Dream stood testament to his struggle, that war between conforming to what others wanted and walking alone down his own dark road. Born in Laval in 1844 to a tinsmith who had some money but not much else. No schooling in art did he receive, worked forty years as a gabelou collecting coins at the town gates though they called him douanier like he was something more than he was. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground, leaving him with just Julia and a grief that sat in his chest like a stone. Painting became his refuge, his escape from the darkness that surrounded him.\n\nHe wasnt like them other painters who made pretty pictures of peasants with their romantic notions. He was of the folk and painted like the folk, carrying their hopes in his hands like water. His wanting to be accepted by them art folk was a thing you could understand if you looked at it right. No education had he in the ways of painting and was old when he started, working alongside them that had made names for themselves already.\n\nMatisse was rising then, when Rousseau finally got some notice. Gordon wrote in his book about modern French painters that these two men were different as night and day. Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make pictures so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy for men like him, men who carry dreams in their pockets like copper pennies, hoping someday they might turn to gold.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Couldn't say why exactly but he reckoned there was something to it. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on some Greek pot, said beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and wrong and what makes something fine to look at, they come from somewhere deeper. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how folk try to explain these things, breaking them down into little pieces like a butcher with a carcass. They'd take apart a painting or a deed and name all its parts but never get to the heart of it. Like that painting of the woman with the strange smile. People talked about light and shadow and history but none of that told you why it made your chest tight to look at it. Most times when you asked someone why they loved some piece of art they'd just say there was something about it, something they couldn't put their finger on. Like trying to describe the taste of water.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things couldn't be told straight out, had to come sideways through a story. No matter how many words you used there was always something left over, something that wouldn't get caught in the net of language. Same with knowing right from wrong. That Austrian fella Wittgenstein said you couldn't even speak it proper, said it was beyond words altogether.\n\nThe connection twixt the two, between what's right and what's beautiful, it lived in that space beyond words. Hit you in a place you couldn't point to, like a ghost touching your heart. Books though, they was different. McKean had it right when he said books was special cause they carried the weight of living in them. Values, he called them. Said that's what made books matter, cause they showed us how to be human in a world that sometimes forgot what that meant.\n\nSitting there in the growing dark he thought on all this. Thought about how some truths was like smoke, visible but impossible to hold. How beauty and goodness was tied together like a knot that couldn't be undone. And maybe that's all any man needed to know.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold beneath a gray sky that hangs like a burial shroud from München to the dark waters of Kiel. A country now but once it was nothing but blood and soil and the ghosts of ancient tribes that walked these grounds. The culture moves like a river through the heart of it all, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds slow and methodical through stone.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself lost to time and the whispers of dead scholars who argued its meaning in candlelit rooms now turned to dust. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians, how they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar knew them too. Called them Germanus in his writings, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Roman boots. Some say the word meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls. Others speak of spears called ger, or the battle cry that split the air like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote more. His words scratched onto parchment in 98 AD telling of a people pure as winter snow, untouched by the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild land of bitter skies and darker hearts? Only those born to it. Only those who knew nothing else.\n\nThe Romans came though. Came and went like storms across the land, taking what they could carry, leading men to die in foreign soil. But they always returned to their marble columns and paved roads, leaving Germania to those who knew its ways. The tribes lived on the edge of empire, trading forest gold and warrior blood, serving in legions not their own while the years turned slow as millstones grinding all to dust.",
            "The play stretched out before him like some vast tapestry of deception and truth woven together in threads of gold and shadow. He watched it unfold in his mind, the way disguise worked its dark magick through the characters like a slow poison or a balm depending on how you held it to the light. Truth was they all wore masks. Every last one of them. And underneath those masks lay other masks still, peeling away layer by layer until what remained was either salvation or damnation.\n\nHe thought about Viola mostly. How she'd shed her woman's skin like a snake in winter, taking on man's flesh not out of want but necessity. The foreign shore had teeth and she knew it. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she'd said, voice already changing like the tide, \"Where lie my maiden weeds.\" Protection, yes. But protection carries its own price.\n\nThe deception worked its way through the story like a dark river cutting through stone. It isolated her from the women, left her adrift in a sea of complications. Olivia's love came at her sideways, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Words thrown like stones across still water. And Orsino with his thousand declarations, never knowing the truth that stood before him in borrowed clothes: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nHe considered how the modern eye might see it different. How deception sometimes forces truth from its hiding place like smoke from a burrow. Olivia's desire for Cesario might mean something deeper, something hidden beneath the surface like old bones in river mud. But more likely it spoke to the foolishness of those who judge by the shell and not the meat within. When Sebastian appeared she transferred her love quick as summer lightning, and Cesario became sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" Simple as that. Clean as a knife cut.\n\nThe truth was masks served their purpose until they didn't. Then they had to fall away like dead skin or they'd grow into the flesh permanent-like, and a person would forget what lay beneath. That was the real danger. Not the wearing but the forgetting.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the dead. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names like cold stones in the mouth. Dust and bones scattered in that hardscrabble land where the empire had come and gone like some dark caravan bearing death in its wagons. But empires aint built on simple things and this was no different. Each colony carved from earth and blood had its own way. Its own truth.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like relics from some forgotten time. The British who came after spoke of it. How the Germans had built schools there. How they had taught them. But in the southwest there was nothing. Just mission houses scattered like broken teeth in a dead mans skull where the churches did what they could with what little they had. The Germans built fine schools there too but they werent for the natives. No. They were for the white children. The settlers children. Their bloodline preserved in brick and mortar while the African children watched from beyond the fence where their futures lay scattered in the dust like spent cartridges.\n\nHe thought about the numbers sometimes. Fifteen thousand whites in the southwest by 1913. More than anywhere else in their African holdings. The climate drew them like flies to meat. Not gentle but livable. Desert stretched its fingers across the land but a man could survive there. Could build something. But what they built was a wall. A wall between knowing and not knowing. Between reading and not reading. Between being and not being.\n\nThe books told it different ways. Most in German text, written when the empire still breathed. Later the English came with their own tellings. Their own comparisons. Cohen wrote of it. How the settlers made the difference. How their presence shaped everything like wind shapes stone. But there was more to it than that. There always is. Dark truths buried in darker soil. Waiting.\n\nIn the east they learned. In the west they didnt. Simple as that but nothing is simple. Nothing at all.",
            "They called it fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three the blood flowed between them like some ancient biblical curse. Two nations locked in their death dance across the desert wastes. America and Mexico. Each carrying their own god in their teeth like mad dogs.\n\nThe war came in forty-six. American boots marking time across Mexican soil while the desert sun watched indifferent and cruel. When it was done Texas lay in American hands and with it the great southwestern wastes. But the blood didnt stop there. It wouldnt stop for years yet.\n\nThey were different peoples carrying different gods. The Americans with their protestant prayers and the Mexicans with their Catholic saints. Like old world hatreds carried across the sea in the holds of wooden ships. The English and Spanish had passed down their ancient feuds like some dark inheritance and now their children played out those old wars in new lands.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those years. Border raids and frontier justice dealing death in small measures. Bandits and outlaws moving like wraiths across the invisible lines men had drawn in the sand. Lines meant nothing to them. They killed and stole and vanished back across the border leaving nothing but ash and bone behind.\n\nThe rivalry died slow like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American gold and the American dream changed from land to commerce. Some things dont die clean. They linger like ghosts haunting the margins of ledger books and trade agreements. The desert remembers though. Every drop of blood spilled there marks the sand forever and the wind carries the memories of dead men in its teeth.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most things that take you down but swift and merciless as a hangman's drop. I didn't even know such afflictions existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd tell you nursing was sure as sunrise. People getting sick and dying, that's what people do. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying. Like making a deal with death himself.\n\nNow here I was. Forty-six years gone from birth, alone in the world save for my affliction, bank account empty as a desert well. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I ever called mine has turned to dust. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and worthlessness. Nothing certain anymore except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth that stands like bedrock: without my blood kin and the few true souls who stayed, I'd have been carried off by the dark waters long ago. When disaster comes it strips you bare, leaves you naked as a newborn in the cold world.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No map shows where they lay waiting. You can fill your storehouse to the rafters but some storms are too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone against the world, like them pioneers who crossed the mountains west. But that ain't the truth of it. What kept them wagon trains rolling wasn't the strength of one man but the bonds between many. Compassion and respect, the sharing of what little they had. Nobody crossed them mountains alone.\n\nSo yes, keep your disaster kit. Stack your canned goods and matches. Lay in water tablets and medical supplies like you're preparing for the end times. Plant your garden if you've got the ground for it. But while you're building your fortress against what's coming, remember this: know your neighbor's face. Learn their story. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't gonna be you alone against it. It'll be all of us or none.",
            "In the old world before the old world there was a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. He walked out of his palace one day and never went back. Found something in himself that wasnt there before. Something that burned like a coal in the deepest part of night. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion he built stands different. Changed. In Sri Lanka they cut the water every year. Some ceremony. Monks in their robes like old ghosts moving through the current. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down to the marrow of what they believe. What they think will save them.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Like a sickness. Some meant harm and others didnt care either way but the changes came all the same. Inside the walls of their temples the monks watched it happen. Outside the merchants and farmers and all manner of men watched too. Some fought it. Others didnt.\n\nAt the heart of it all three things. Buddha himself. The Dhamma which is their holy word written in three parts. The Sangha which is their church if you could call it that. The books tell em what they need to know. How to live. What rules to follow. What lies behind the veil of the world. They say theres no soul. Say life is suffering. Say nothing lasts. Round and round they go dying and being born again until they figure it out. Until they shake off want and hate and being blind to what is real.\n\nThe monks got their rules and the common folk got theirs. Five things they cant do. Cant kill. Cant lie. Cant steal. Cant do wrong with their bodies. Cant poison their minds with drink or worse things. But at the bottom of it all four truths like old stones in a dry riverbed. Life is pain. Want causes pain. Pain can end. Theres a way out if youre strong enough to take it."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

He gathered evidence like a man gathering firewood, piece by piece, building his case with cold logic and colder reason. Five proofs he laid out like stones in a path: change, cause, necessity, perfection, and order. Each one leading to God like tracks in the sand lead to the sea. He would say you need no faith when the truth stands before you plain as day. That God can be proven like theorems are proven, with hard facts and harder logic.\n\nYet neither man's path leads all the way home. They are like blind men touching different parts of the same vast beast, each describing only what their hands can reach. One feels the trunk, the other the tusk, but neither sees the whole. The truth of God, if there be such a truth, lies somewhere beyond both faith and reason, in that twilight realm where both paths end and something else begins.",
            "Words lay like dead things on the page and the way a writer might string them together to make meaning was a thing beyond knowing. But Fitzgerald he knew something of this and in his book about the man Gatsby he worked at it like a craftsman might work metal or wood, bending and shaping until the thing took form. He used words in ways they weren't meant to be used, pairing them wrong like mismatched horses in a team, but somehow they pulled true. And he took colors and made them mean things they had no business meaning, gold and green and white and gray and red, all of them carrying weight like pack animals bearing loads too heavy for their frames.\n\nThe white and gray they spoke of sameness, of things worn smooth by time and use. White being the color of money and privilege, gray being what white becomes when hope dies. You could see it in how he wrote it. Everywhere white clothes like banners of surrender. Daisy and Jordan floating in white like ghosts. Nick in his white flannels and Tom in his white shirt and Catherine powdered white as bone. Only at Gatsby's did the colors rage wild and primary like something torn loose from its moorings. The rest was all white chasms in the city and gray names written in gray books and white buildings lined up like headstones. A white girlhood that might never have happened at all. Gray cars and gray land in that valley where ashes fell like snow that never melted.\n\nHe used these colors like a man might use a knife, cutting meaning into things. When Daisy came back she was all in white, driving a white car, and you could see then what she was - just another piece in a game being played out. Not a woman at all but a thing to be possessed, wrapped in gray fur like something already dead. She moved through the story like a sleepwalker, all in white, never touching the ground, never leaving footprints. Just another ghost in Gatsby's haunted house.",
            "The county lay before them like some vast promise, the mild air carrying whispers of citrus and tomato vines stretching endless toward the horizon. Fields there were, and orchards, the fruit hanging heavy and low, peaches and lemons both, and berries dark as blood in the morning sun. Men and women worked these fields without the poisons of their fathers, their hands calloused testaments to labors ancient and true. The waiting lists for such pure food grew long as scripture, the people hungry for eggs still warm from their laying, milk white as God's own blessing.\n\nThey came to walk these lands, these pilgrims, to witness the workings of soil and seed. To watch birds wheel overhead in formations old as time. The government men came too with their papers and promises, speaking of programs and benefits, but the land cared nothing for such things. It gave forth its bounty or it did not.\n\nThe price was steep. Without the chemicals that had scoured the earth in years past, the work grew harder. Weeds pushed through like memories of Eden, insects came in biblical swarms. The small farmers watched their larger brothers with their machines and their poisons, knowing they could never match such efficiency. Yet they persisted. They planted cover crops in the wisdom of their grandfathers, moved their cattle in patterns like old ceremonies, fought back the invasive species that came like thieves in the night.\n\nNear Potrero they found land. One hundred and sixty acres where chaparral met grassland, where oak trees stood sentinel as dark prophets. The Cleveland Forest pressed against it like a ancient wall. Here the creatures dwelt that man had nearly destroyed - the kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, butterflies nameless and rare as answered prayers. The burrowing owl watched from its underground cathedral, its future uncertain as all futures must be.\n\nBefore the ranchers came with their cattle and their axes, before they felled the trees for cordwood, the Indians had walked these hills. Their ghosts still moved through the oak shadows, their footsteps quiet as falling leaves. The homesteaders came after, their patent on the land a piece of paper that meant everything and nothing. They grazed their cattle and cut their wood and were in turn forgotten.\n\nHe studied the property listings like a man reading auguries, searching for signs in the government programs that might make such a venture possible. Somewhere nearby another farm had found this balance, this covenant between profit and preservation. He thought perhaps he could do the same, though the path was dark and the outcome uncertain as all things must be in this world.",
            "Brothers carry bonds that run deeper than blood. Deep as stone. Deep as time itself. They look upon each other and see not just flesh and bone but mirrors of themselves, reflections cast back through the dark waters of time. In these waters swim love and pride and cruelty and things without names, ancient things that have no words in any tongue of man.\n\nThe boy called Doodle came into this world broke and bent, his heart weak as a sparrow's. His brother watched him, studied him like some strange creature pulled from the depths, wondering if he'd draw breath come morning. Some nights he'd stand over the cradle thinking dark thoughts, his small hands hovering above the pillow like pale spiders. But then Doodle smiled and something in his brother's heart cracked open like an egg.\n\nPride's a terrible thing. It burns in the blood like poison. The brother had dreamed of someone to race through the pinewoods, to climb the old vines that hung like gallows rope in Woman Swamp, to swim the black waters of Horsehead Landing. But Doodle could barely crawl. Could barely stand. His legs thin as twigs, his chest rising and falling with each labored breath.\n\nThey moved through that green country like pilgrims in some ancient fable. The brother leading, Doodle following, their footprints marking the red clay like stigmata. Above them the pines stood sentinel, their branches reaching toward a sky gone gray as gunmetal. The ibis came later, red as blood, red as sin, falling from that same sky like some divine omen. But by then it was too late. Pride had done its work. The storm had come. And in its wake only one brother remained to tell the tale.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing simple. It works in ways we cannot know and cannot tell. Time was when men thought it no more than marks pressed into wax or words scratched onto dried reeds from the river. Then they said it was like them books that gathered dust in libraries. Now they say its like them machines that hum and click and speak in numbers. But all these things is just words and words aint truth.\n\nThe way the mind takes in the world is like this. Light falls on the eye and sound moves through the air and the flesh feels what it touches and all these things become something else. Something that aint quite real no more but aint quite dream neither. The mind takes these things and works em over. Sometimes it works from the bottom up like when you're looking at something you aint never seen before. Other times it works from what it already knows, like when you seen something before and your mind already knows what its fixing to see. Like looking at a black square drawn on white paper. Your eyes see the edges first, where black meets white, but your mind already knows what its gonna be before your eyes is done looking.\n\nThe mind decides what's worth paying mind to and what aint. Like how you can walk across grass and never see each blade even though your eyes take em all in, or how you can hear your name called out in a crowd even when theres a hundred other voices speaking. The mind sifts through it all like a prospector panning for gold.\n\nEverything that goes into the mind has got to be stored somewhere. There's different kinds of storing, like how you can remember something just happened or something from long ago. First the mind has to take it in, like how words can be remembered for how they look wrote down or how they sound spoke or what they mean in the deep dark of your thoughts. Some men who study animals say the quick memories that last about twenty seconds is like electricity running round and round through the brain, while the old memories is stored in the very meat of the mind itself, in them little bits they call proteins.\n\nThey got different ways of thinking bout how all this knowledge is put together in there. Some say its like a web where everything's connected to everything else that's like it. Like how chair connects to table connects to wood and on and on until everything in the world is tied together in ways we cant see but the mind knows. But that's just another story we tell ourselves in the dark.",
            "They called it a crisis but it was more like a slow death. The kind that creeps up on you in the night when you're sleeping warm in your bed dreaming of better days. In 2007 the country fell. Not with cannon fire or trumpet blast but with the quiet clicking of computers and the rustling of papers in tall glass buildings where men in suits watched numbers fall like dead leaves in autumn.\n\nThe streets grew empty. Houses stood like tombstones with their windows dark and their doors locked against owners who would never return. Men who once wore suits now carried cardboard signs at intersections. Their eyes vacant. Their hands trembling. Everything that was solid turned to ash.\n\nIt started in the time of Clinton. A president who wanted more years in his white house like a king who cant let go his crown. He loosened the chains that held the banks in check. Let them run wild and free like rabid dogs through the streets of commerce. A man named Holmes wrote about it in the paper. Saw it coming like a man can see storm clouds gathering on a distant horizon. But no one listened. No one ever listens until the rain starts falling.\n\nThey made new kinds of money. Paper promises wrapped in more paper promises. Adjustable rates that adjusted only upward like a hangmans noose drawing ever tighter. CDOs they called them. Complex names for simple greed. The banks grew fat on these paper promises. Built towers of glass and steel that reached toward heaven like the tower of Babel. And like Babel they fell.\n\nWhen it all came apart it came apart fast. Five great houses of money watched their empires crumble. Four point one trillion dollars. Numbers so big they lose all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in the desert. Bear Stearns fell first. Then Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers died in the night. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed. Broken. Transformed into something else entirely. Something lesser.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Names that sound like characters from a childrens story but there was nothing innocent about them. Five trillion in debt. A number that would make God himself weep. The government took them in the end. Like putting down a rabid dog. It had to be done but nobody wanted to watch.\n\nThis is how empires fall. Not with a bang but with the quiet scratch of a pen on paper. With the soft whisper of money changing hands in dark rooms. With promises made that can never be kept. This is how the world ends. Not all at once but piece by piece until theres nothing left but dust and memories and the long dark road ahead.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like birds fallen from winter trees. No life in them. No breath. Just black marks that told of things that never were and never would be. The writer knew this truth but could not help herself from piling more words atop the others like a funeral pyre waiting for flame.\n\nShe'd been taught the old ways. Show dont tell they'd said. As if words could do anything but tell. As if showing wasnt just another kind of lying. But she wrote on anyway, filling pages with histories that never happened to people who never lived. Telling of marriages and murders and meetings in the night. Two lines of dialogue was all she gave them. Two lines to speak their piece before the darkness took them.\n\nThe husband died on page four. Shot through the heart though no one saw it happen. Just words on a page saying he was dead and she was alone and that was that. No time spent watching him move through the world. No chance to know the weight of his presence or the sound of his breath in the dark. Just gone. Like they all go in the end.\n\nThe writer knew better. Knew you had to give them more. Had to put meat on them bones. Had to make them real enough to mourn. But knowing dont make the doing any easier. Sometimes the words come fast and desperate like theyre running from something. Sometimes you just want to get it all down before it slips away. Before the darkness comes.\n\nLike that fellow at the gas station. Ex Air Force they said. Two wives. No kids. Liked to fish. Had dreams about owning the place someday. Ate eggs benedict that morning though God knows where he found hollandaise sauce in this world. All of it true maybe. All of it lies probably. But what difference did it make? He was just words on a page. Just another ghost in a world full of ghosts. Just another story that never got told right.",
            "He watched the news come through the glass eye, the morning light harsh and cold in Columbus. First came word of evil done in Ashley, a man called Hostettler who'd taken blade to wife, the darkness in his eyes staring out from the booking photo like some ancient thing dredged up from below. They gave it two minutes. No more. Just enough to tell of multiple wounds and iron bars that waited.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen summers old and now laid low by gunshot in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The story passed quick as wind through dead grass, like so many tales of the darker folk who fell victim in this godless time. White faces lingered longer on the screen, their stories told and retold until they became legend.\n\nNews of a bullet hole in the flying machine they called Med-Flight. Twenty-two caliber from a rifle, they said. Money offered for the shooter's name, five thousand dollars to break the silence that held his identity like a tomb.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder promised for the afternoon, temperatures hovering in the eighties like restless ghosts. Brief words meant to keep eyes fixed to the screen, bait for the commercial break.\n\nThen robbery at the UDF on Clime Road. They spoke of the thief's blackness like it was a thing you could touch, described his dark skin and hood as if painting some nightmare creature. Six foot tall and lean as a winter wolf. They dwelt on his color like men obsessed with darkness.\n\nLast came word of Rodriguez, the drug lord from Texas. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years, as if counting each month might make the sentence heavier. They named him Hispanic though it mattered not at all to the weight of his crimes or the years that waited to swallow him.\n\nThrough it all the news anchor sat pristine and distant as a priest, passing judgment on the day's sins while outside the real world turned, uncaring and vast beneath an indifferent sky.",
            "He studied the numbers laid out before him like bones in the sand, each figure telling its own tale of worth and loss in the vast wasteland of the market. ETF, they called it. Exchange traded fund. A thing that moved like a serpent through the exchanges, tracking indices and commodities with the cold precision of a predator. Not unlike the mutual funds of old but leaner, meaner, more adapted to survive in these harsh financial climes.\n\nThe boy looked at the figures. What do they mean Papa, he said.\n\nThey mean survival son. A way to spread our chances across the wasteland. Like having many arrows instead of one.\n\nThe numbers showed the truth of it. Ten holdings making up near sixty-four percent of the whole thing. Each one carrying its own weight like pack animals in a caravan across the desert of uncertainty. UnitedHealth Group. CVS Health Corp. Elevance Health. Their percentages written in blood-red ink against the stark white paper.\n\nHe'd done the calculations in the dim light of evening, figures scratched out with a pencil worn nearly to the nub. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, six point eleven percent higher, like a child outgrowing its father. The beta lower by point twelve, as if the offspring had learned to move more cautiously through the financial wilderness.\n\nBut numbers could lie. He knew this like he knew the sound of his own breathing in the dark. Statistical significance hung over the data like a shroud, demanding to be acknowledged. Standard deviations lined up like sentries, each one guarding its own truth about risk and return.\n\nThe market is no country for old men, he thought. It gives no quarter and asks none in return. Each transaction leaving its mark like the fossilized footprints of ancient creatures in stone.\n\nThey sat there in the gathering gloom, father and son, studying the figures as if reading an ancient text that might reveal the secrets of survival in this harsh financial world. The boy looked up at him.\n\nWill it protect us, he said.\n\nYes. If anything can.\n\nBut you're not sure.\n\nNo. I'm not sure. Nothing is sure anymore.\n\nThe numbers stared back at them, cold and unblinking as the eyes of the dead.",
            "The numbers fell off like dead leaves in that third month. Just fell away. You could study that Figure 17 til your eyes went dim and still not know the why of it. Winter came hard to them New England grounds like it always did, cold and merciless, and them bicycle riders and walkers just disappeared into whatever shelter they could find. December it was. End of term with its burdens of papers and grades weighing down on everyone like stones. Maybe that commuter log just got lost in the shuffle of things, like so many papers do.\n\nThe holidays came too. Always do. Campus emptied out like a dead town, buildings standing dark and silent against the gray sky. When January dragged itself in, bringing them students and teachers back, weren't many filling out them logs. February was worse. Numbers so low you could count em on one hand. Might be that first fire of excitement just burned itself out, way fires do when there aint nothing left to feed em.\n\nWe tried something then. Called it the Carpool Challenge Week. March it was. Like throwing fresh wood on dying embers, trying to bring that flame back. Worked some. Numbers came up, but they was different somehow. Weaker.\n\nThing about people is they love their cars. Love em like kin. Its in the blood of this country, deep as original sin. We tried to lure em away with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and such. Books too. Even them big store chains. But maybe we should've gone bigger. Bicycle maybe. One of them hybrid cars even. Electric one perhaps. Something to make em sit up and take notice.\n\nThem first prizes worked fine at the start. People's eyes would light up at the mention of em. But they was like giving pennies to a man who needed dollars. If we'd have brought out something bigger in December, maybe one of them bicycles, then come January dropped the news about a car - hybrid or electric, don't matter which - well, might've kept em interested. Might've kept em coming back. Instead of watching em drift away like smoke in that winter wind.",
            "I set to watching them old Edison pictures, them trick films from the turn of the century, fifteen of them laid out before me like cards in some devil's game spanning 1895 to 1901. Strange illusions wrought in silver and light, crafted by men who knew the dark art of cutting and splicing celluloid dreams. They was mostly bound by rules old as theatre itself, rules that grew from the ground like weeds through concrete, choking out any notion of something different.\n\nThey kept their pictures in boxes made of sets and stages, all shot straight on like God himself was watching from the cheap seats. Camera bolted down like it was afraid to move. Everything far off or middling far, never close enough to see a man's soul in his eyes. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. Except when it wasnt.\n\nThe pictures lived in rooms built special for them, rooms with invisible walls facing forward like church pews. Camera didnt follow nothing. It stood there dead still like a hanging judge, watching. This way of doing came down from theatre folk and carnival men who knew about fooling eyes. Characters moved sideways like crabs, never coming forward, never going back. Take that picture Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel. Josh and them others, they shuffle side to side like theyre afraid of something in the deep dark behind the lens.\n\nThey shot everything from far off, sometimes a little closer but never close enough to count teeth. Never saw nobody's eyes up close in them days. Theatre folk taught them that too, keeping everything in view all at once like God intended. Actors stayed back where they belonged, away from the glass eye watching them.\n\nMost times one shot was all there was, one minute of magic before the light died. Wasnt much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and switches, people appearing and vanishing like smoke in wind. But them shots wasnt always what they seemed. Take that old picture of Mary Queen of Scots getting her head cut off. Look close enough and youll see where they stitched the death together, like a butcher hiding the seam in meat.",
            "The Gothic tale aint new and it aint old neither. It's both and that's what Ian Watt called it in his book about such things. Some folks praised it and others cursed it and said it was hollow inside like an old dried gourd left too long in the field. But it had power in it. The kind that makes men shiver and think about what's beyond the dark.\n\nThe first of these tales came from Horace Walpole who wrote about a castle and things that happened there. He took old things and new things and mixed them together like a man might mix water and whiskey, knowing neither one alone would do what he needed. The story he made was full of old stone and older shadows, full of things from medieval times when men built great towers that reached up toward God like the fingers of dead men reaching through dirt.\n\nIn them days the word gothic meant different things to different folk. Some thought it meant barbarians and others thought it meant them pointed arches in old churches where the light comes down in dusty beams like God's own fingers touching earth. Most folk thought it was something dead and gone, like bones bleaching in the sun. But Walpole, he took that dead thing and breathed life into it, made it walk again.\n\nThe heart of these tales was something called chivalry. Not the kind where men open doors for women but the old kind, where knights rode out into the dark carrying steel and faith like twin flames against the night. Walpole saw his own time was missing something. Something important that had gotten lost like a coin dropped in tall grass. He was living in troubled times when men's hearts had gone cold and their honor had dried up like creek beds in summer.\n\nIn his tale there's a man called Frederic who carries the old ways in him like embers in ash. Before you even meet him you know what he is. A prince who's suffered and bled and been thought dead at the hands of heathens. He's what knights was supposed to be, though Walpole made him larger than life, like a shadow cast by candlelight that stretches tall against a wall.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to finished goods it winds its way across the land leaving tracks of commerce in its wake. Oliver found it first back in 82, gave it a name though it had existed long before any man thought to call it such. Six parts to the beast: the making and the getting, the keeping and the placing, the moving and the knowing. All of it bound together like vertebrae in some ancient creature's spine.\n\nThe making comes first. Always has. Always will. Must know what's needed fore you can birth it into being. The market speaks if you know how to listen, tells you what folk hunger for in their bones. Managers stand like prophets reading signs in the wind, counting volume and quality like priests counting sacrificial lambs. Choose wrong and the whole thing falls to dust and ash. Seen it before in them big box stores where I done my time. Walmart. Target. Each one with their own scripture writ down in manuals thick as bibles, telling how every little thing ought be done from the way a man wears his clothes to how the trucks get emptied of their guts.\n\nThe getting comes next. Strategic they call it, like generals planning war. Deciding what each place can do best, what parts to keep close and what to send out to others. Sometimes you got to spread the work around, let other outfits take their piece. They call it velocity when they do that, though it ain't about speed so much as it's about being nimble while keeping the coin in your pocket. Like a man trying to dance quick without spilling his whiskey.\n\nEach facility stands like its own fortress. Got its own soldiers with their own weapons, each one knowing their part in the greater war of commerce. Management looks down from high walls deciding where the strength lies, where the weakness shows. Sometimes they send the work away, let other armies fight them battles. All of it moving like blood through veins, keeping the great beast alive.",
            "The books of that age bore the weight of detail like ornate Victorian mansions, all finery and aristocratic airs. But there were two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These carried something else in them. Something raw. Something that crept through the pages like a night-thing, unnamed and watchful. Mystery lived in their bones and the peculiar haunted their margins and this strangeness gave their people flesh and blood and hearts that beat true.\n\nThere was a passage where the boy Oliver walked in darkness. He moved between Sikes and Crackit like a ghost might walk between two demons arguing in hell. Their voices came to him across some vast distance though they stood at his shoulders. Then gunfire split the night and screaming rose up like birds scattered from a field. Lights bloomed in the dark. Pain lived in him then, deep and constant as breathing. Some unseen hand bore him away through this fever-dream of blood and noise and he could not fight it. Could not even try.\n\nThese nightmares they wrote into their books served different purposes but all showed the truth that lived beneath. In Oliver's tale they revealed what lay coiled in his heart, what ate at him in the dark hours, what whispered to him about the true nature of things. When they shot the boy and he relived it later it came back like a tide of darkness. No control did he have then. No power over his own destiny. The pain had made its home in him by then, wed to fear rather than shock. And through it all ran the question of whose will had brought him to this place, for surely it was not his own. The old jew Fagin had begun his work by then, breaking the boy piece by piece until despair became as natural as breathing. Even with death at his heels Oliver could not fight. Could not even try to save himself.\n\nThe day that followed was no day at all but merely night's brief absence. Then true night came again, somehow endless in its terrible silence yet fleeting in its hours, as if time itself had gone mad in the darkness.",
            "There was a time I worked with the young ones, after their schooling was done for the day. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy named Adrian, dark eyes and quiet like they sometimes are. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with the way he read. Letters all scattered in his mind like windblown leaves. Some he knew true and others might as well have been marks made by birds in the dust.\n\nHe spoke the English good enough. Clean and clear like any American child. Latino blood in him sure but you'd never know it from his speech. We worked at it, him and me, day after day until his mother came. It was during a field trip day and I was watching the ones left behind. She came in speaking no English at all. Just Spanish words falling soft like rain. My own Spanish was poor, broken things really, but we made do. And then I knew. Knew it like you know the coming of winter. The boy could read fine enough. Just not in English. The letters were foreign to him like tracks in the snow.\n\nThe language wall stands high in these schools. Higher in California than most places. Sometimes you cant even see it until youre right up on it. Even those that speak the English perfect as morning light, reading it can be like crossing a river in flood. Everyone knows this truth but knowing aint fixing.\n\nFor Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him the letters. Show him the sounds they make. But for the others, the ones who barely know English at all, theres no simple answer. Dual language. Immersion. Special teachers. ESL. None of these alone will do it. You need them all together like fingers making a fist.\n\nThe dual language way, thats something worth considering. Not just for the Spanish speakers but all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folk fear it. Say its wasteful. Say it wont help the majority. But thats not true. Make it the rule instead of the exception and watch them all rise. Dont need every teacher speaking both tongues. That aint realistic. But having some that do, special helpers who know both worlds, that might be the way. Might be the only way.",
            "They tell you when youre small that theres something bigger than you are. Something you cant know with your mind. Some go to wooden buildings with crosses nailed to the walls and some go elsewhere and some just look inside themselves til their eyes go dark with looking. Most take what their people gave them like a worn coat passed down. Others spit on it all and say theres nothing but what they can hold in their own two hands. We take up one way of seeing then trade it for another like old coins we found in the dirt. No matter. We all walk that same road looking for that thing bigger than ourselves. Looking for some light in all that dark to lead us home.\n\nPapa set in that old chair on the porch, rain coming down hard on the tin roof overhead. Sound like gravel in a metal drum. We smoked together and watched the rain drown them flowers along the porch edge where the gutters spilled. Asked him what bird he liked best and he said Cardinal and then he just stared out into that rain. Looking and not looking. Clothes hanging off him like someone elses skin. Hair thin now where it used to be thick. He wouldnt look at me and I couldnt speak the words that needed speaking. Words about missing and about loss. Speaking them would make the loss more real somehow. More final. I moved my chair closer to his. Hugged him once. Then we just watched that June rain come down in the growing dark.\n\nHe died in December. Five days after I turned twentytwo. They gave him radiation and poison to fight the thing growing inside him but it just made him suffer longer. I lay in bed nights asking what sort of God would do such a thing. No prayers came. If there was a God he'd stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didnt watch him go. Didnt want to see the life that made my life drain away like water in sand. Wanted to remember him living not dying. Known him better than any of them anyway. Known he wouldnt want his boy watching death take him. So I curled up in my bed like some hurt animal and waited three days for word.\n\nWord never came.",
            "The man they called John Taylor of Caroline walked the fields of his plantation with purpose, knowing in his bones what the land could teach about freedom and governance. He was a farmer first and always would be, though the affairs of men had pulled him brief into their politics. The soil spoke to him of sovereignty and justice and the rights of men to work the earth as they saw fit.\n\nHe saw America raw and new like fresh-plowed ground, unencumbered by the dead weight of tradition that plagued the old world. Here was earth waiting to be seeded with self-governance. He knew about rights. Natural rights. How they tangled together like roots in rich soil, one failing and all failing, withering under the boot of government overreach. These were things no man should touch.\n\nThe state of nature, some called it. Taylor knew better. Knew how the strong and cunning would always prey upon the weak without the structures of civilization to bind them. But civilization itself was a double-edged blade.\n\nHe believed men carried both light and dark within them, good principles and bad bound together like wheat and chaff. Good principles protected what a man owned, nurtured the land, kept the money-changers at bay. Self-interest drove all men, he knew, but it turned poison when it led to parasitic sub-societies feeding off the public good.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time he called for strict adherence to the Constitution, wanted federal power bound tight as a starving dog. He'd seen how bloated government bred despotism like flies on carrion. But simple reading of law wasn't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who wrote it. The Declaration, that was the true charter. It spoke of sovereign states, not one nation bound in iron chains of central control.\n\nHe knew these things bone-deep, like he knew the feel of soil crumbling between his fingers. The truth of it was in the land itself, in the sweat and toil of honest work. Everything else was just words floating away on the wind.",
            "He stood there watchin the brown mass in the water below. Silent. Studying it with a detachment that came from years of such work. Thoughts like autumn leaves blown across an empty lot, there and gone again. His mind moved like water over stone, smooth and without purchase.\n\nHe remembered the art book. Some woman had give it to him years ago when he was still dreamin of bein an artist. Said it would teach him bout seein things proper. How to frame em up in your mind. Make em simpler. But there wasnt nothin simple about what he was lookin at now. No frame could contain it. Just stood there like a man before some terrible altar, his green tie hangin down like a hanged mans tongue.\n\nIf them old painters had their colors then this here was his. His testimony. His offering to whatever god watched over such things. Brown and perfect in its way. Like some cosmic joke played out in porcelain.\n\nHis hand found the handle. Pulled it. Watched the water swirl and eddy, clear as mountain stream water. The mass broke apart some but wouldnt go. Like it had made some covenant with the bowl. He flushed again. And again. Each time watchin the water rise and fall like the breath of some sleepin beast.\n\nFinally he reached for the paper. Started wrappin his hand like them ancient peoples wrapped their dead. Layer after layer till his hand was swaddled in white. A priest preparin for some unholy sacrament. He bent at the waist, his arm descendin slow into them cool waters like a man reachin down into hell itself to shake hands with the devil.\n\nThe fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Silent witnesses to this ritual played out in a Rite Aid bathroom on some nameless Tuesday in a world that had long since stopped carin about such things. About the men who cleaned up after it. About anything at all.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers but the dead speak nothing of their passing. The National Institutes say the young brain aint ready, like green wood that wont take a proper shape no matter how you work it. Inexperience kills them sure as any bullet. Their vehicles roll and speed and leave the road like wild things seeking their own destruction.\n\nWhen they gather they die together. Like moths to flame. The California men who study such things showed it plain as day in their charts and papers. Numbers that tell of dead children stacked like cordwood.\n\nThe state men made their laws. Papers that say when the young ones can drive and who they can carry. As if paper could stop death. But these are just words written in offices by men who've forgotten what it was to be young and wild and immortal.\n\nEven eighteen's too young says the doctor Zuckerman who studies such things. They seek the thrill like animals seeking water in drought, he says. They cant help themselves no more than a wolf can help howling at the moon. Wait till the blood cools, he says. Wait till they aint so ready to die.\n\nMore are coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they was reaching for loaded guns. By 2010 theyll flood the roads like water breaking through a dam. Death rides shotgun with them all.\n\nThe fix aint hard to see though men make it seem so. Keep them learning in their schools but keep them off the roads till eighteen's past. Let them practice with their elders watching. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more with someone who knows death's way. Make it the same in every state cause death dont care about state lines.\n\nSome will say this aint new thinking. And they'd be right. Truth rarely is. But the dead dont care about new or old. They just stay dead all the same.",
            "The boy looked up at him and asked what was wrong with people who couldn't hear right. Not deaf folk, he said, but them that hear wrong somehow. The man studied the ashen sky before speaking.\n\nThey call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, he said. CAPD. Where your ears work fine but your brain cant make sense of what it hears. Like trying to read tracks in the sand after the wind's got to them.\n\nThe boy thought about this. But they can hear?\n\nYes, the man said. They hear but the sounds get twisted somehow. Like looking through dirty glass. Everything's there but nothing's clear.\n\nThey sat watching the dead leaves scatter across the broken parking lot. The man remembered doctors from before. Men in white coats with clipboards who'd study children like they were reading maps to some foreign country. Testing them. Making them listen to sounds and words that came through headphones like distant echoes. Started back in the fifties, he said. Italian doctors. They'd put different words in each ear and watch what happened.\n\nHow do you know if someone has it?\n\nSometimes they cant tell where sounds come from. Like they're lost in space. Sometimes words get jumbled up. Or they cant hear someone talking if there's other noise. Like their brain cant sort out what's important.\n\nThe boy picked up a stick and drew in the dust. What happens to them?\n\nThey need help, the man said. Used to be teachers would know what to do. Special ways of teaching. Special places to sit in class. But that was before. Before all this.\n\nHe gestured at the wasteland around them. The boy nodded, understanding more than he should have to. They sat in silence for a while, listening to the wind move through the dead city.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he was sixteen and afraid and his eyes darted like small animals in a trap. He'd fled from them that raised him, them that should have loved him but didn't. I watched him there and knew what I had to do.\n\nYears before I'd walked the halls of learning seeking knowledge of the mind and its workings. Studied the way folk cope with the darkness in them or flee from it or deny it altogether. Got my papers in Psychology but still the path ahead was dark and unknown like a road at night with no stars to guide by.\n\nThe next day I went to where his people lived. The police were there already, standing in the yard like sentinels in blue. I told them what I knew, told them of my learning in the ways of the mind. They bid me speak to the parents, said the law's hands were tied in such matters. The mother and father spoke in circles, nervous words about their boy being manipulative, about simple disputes made large. But their eyes told different tales. I knew then what I must become.\n\nJustice is a thing we speak of but seldom see. We claim to value the singular soul but we make all souls alike, press them into shapes acceptable to the many. In my younger days I raged against this with wild-colored hair and metal in my flesh and clothes that spoke my truth. Stood with those that society cast aside - the different ones, the ones that loved different from the rest. Fought the old hatreds wherever I found them.\n\nNow I aim to help the lost ones, the broken ones. To work with those cast aside by their own blood. My values are hewn from stone: service to others, respect for their dignity, truth in all dealings. These aren't just words but the very marrow of who I am. The path ahead is clear now, like a road at dawn with the sun rising blood-red in the east. I'll walk it and help who I can along the way.",
            "He set the papers down before him and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and the wanting of it. The darkness that comes unbidden or not at all. He knew these things. The old doctors with their studies and their microscopes looking for answers in the brains of mice while all around them the world burned away to ash.\n\nThey called it insomnia but that word was just a marker for something deeper and more terrible. Something that lived in the blood and bones of men. In their very cells. The hypothalamus with its secret languages of sleep and waking. Neurons firing or not firing. The terrible democracy of consciousness that gave no quarter and took no prisoners.\n\nHe thought about the mice in their cages. The scientists watching them through glass walls while strange chemicals coursed through their blood. GABAB receptors. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice slept or didn't sleep and men wrote down numbers in ledgers and thought they understood something about the night.\n\nBut there were other truths. Darker ones. The kind that lived in the spaces between people. In their histories and their bloodlines. In the weight of generations. Sleep disorders they called them. As if disorder wasnt the natural state of things. As if order was something more than a temporary rebellion against chaos.\n\nThe sociocultural model. The biological model. Words that tried to explain why some men slept while others lay awake counting their breaths in the dark. But they were just words. The truth was in the darkness itself. In the terrible silence between heartbeats. In the long hours before dawn when a man could feel the weight of all his ancestors pressing down on him like stones.\n\nHe thought about the people who couldn't sleep. How they moved through the world like ghosts. How their days bled into their nights until time itself became meaningless. School. Work. The rituals of the living. All of it just shadows on the wall of a cave that got deeper and darker with each passing hour.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. Time moves like a slow river through the valley of days. When I first come here they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of everything where the wind blows cold and merciless across empty fields. Beyond lay only the stadium and the center they call Bryce Jordan, standing like ancient monuments to some forgotten civilization.\n\nThe walk from Stuart Hall to Willard building was a pilgrimage through wasteland, twenty-five minutes if the weather held, longer when the sky turned black and the rain came sideways like it does in State College. An old timer told me once how East Halls used to stand alone out there, separated from everything by dead ground that stretched on forever. Now they've filled it all in. Sports fields. New buildings risen up like concrete monoliths. The Creamery. Health services. Apartment blocks circled round like wagons against the night.\n\nThe campus grows like some mindless thing, devouring space, making distance where there was none before. But there's an answer to this vastness. The bicycle. Simple as scripture. Mechanical and true. Though the machine itself aint worth nothing without riders to push the pedals, and paths to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years away from it. Said he couldn't recollect why he ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, like he'd discovered some profound truth written in steel and rubber. And he wasnt wrong. Bowl of oatmeal and muscle gets you thirty miles. Maybe more.\n\nI live off campus now, far as any dorm. Got myself a bike. Best decision I ever made in this place. Thomas building's my daily destination. Twenty-five minute walk but five minutes riding if you're willing to push. Pollock Road's the straightest shot but it aint always favorable. Could walk, I suppose, if I was of a mind to waste time. But time's a currency I cant afford to spend. Thirty minutes extra each way. Two and a half hours gone each week, vanished like smoke in the wind. More when you count everything else. Time's too precious for that kind of waste.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words about the world that was to come. A world of machines and men who were no longer men. The book spoke of a controller who watched over all things like some dark god. In this world there was no love. No hatred neither. Just the endless consumption of things that meant nothing at all.\n\nThe people there were born into their stations like cattle bred for slaughter. Each one marked from birth to serve their purpose and nothing more. They called it conditioning but it was slavery plain and simple. The lower orders knew nothing of their chains. Kept docile with drugs and empty pleasures while those above them pulled the strings.\n\nHe thought about how the classes moved among each other like ghosts. No true touching. No true knowing. The men spoke of women like they were things made of air and flesh and nothing more. Pneumatic was the word they used. As if the curves of a woman's body were something to be measured like tire pressure. The women no better. Speaking of their couplings like discussing the weather or what they had for breakfast.\n\nEach class stayed in its place like layers in a cake gone stale. The high born alphas and betas looking down from their towers while the others scurried below. All of them prisoners though most didnt know it. Kept in line with promises of happiness that was no happiness at all. Just pleasure without meaning. Without cost. Without pain.\n\nThe controller stood above it all like some dark spider in its web. Watching. Waiting. Feeding them all the same sweet poison that kept them docile and consuming and believing they were free when they were anything but. A machine built of flesh and bone and blood that ground on and on toward nothing at all except its own perpetuation.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the growing dark thinking about how the world was headed down that same road. How men were becoming less than men. How love was dying. How the things that made us human were being stripped away one by one until nothing would be left but the hollow shell of what we once were. And he knew that this was what the writer had seen coming all those years ago. This was what he had tried to warn us about. But who would listen. Who would care. Who would even understand.",
            "Four years past I sat in a room learning of Islam and its ways. The question hung heavy in the air like smoke, whether this faith carried violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, watching the world turn and darken since them towers fell. The papers and screens that once spoke with venom against the faithful now bend backwards in tolerance, as if afraid of their own shadow. Strange days indeed when a man called Barack Obama, with Islam running through his blood like a dark river, could reach for the highest seat in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale troubles me some. What they write of him and what history shows stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a dusty street. In my mind I see him as he was, sword in hand, forcing men to kneel and accept his truth or taste steel. Yet here in these pages he walks soft, humble as a child, drawing men to him like moths to flame. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, bearing his burden in silence while truth worked its way through men's hearts.\n\nThere's something that ain't right about how they mirror the Christ's works in Muhammad's deeds. They tell of him making meat and milk stretch beyond nature's bounds, feeding forty men where there was food for few. It reads false, like a man trying to wear another's skin. They diminish the true miracle of Jesus, stealing his glory to dress their prophet in borrowed light.\n\nThe stories they tell come handed down through too many mouths, like water poured from cup to cup until you can't trust what's left. This man told that man who heard from another - truth gets thin when stretched so far. They mean it as proof but it reads like smoke and mirrors, each telling making the tale more suspect.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is how they fashion him gentle and wise, a shepherd leading his flock with soft words and softer heart. But history speaks different. It speaks of blood and steel and conquest. Sometimes I wonder if the faithful today know the truth of it, or if they too believe in this phantom prophet, this ghost of gentleness that never was.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days upon the earth were cast aside like dead leaves in the wind that followed. If you were to stand upon some high place and look down across the vastness of time you'd see how the truth of it all just kept moving further and further away like some dream you cant quite remember when you wake. These days there's a knowing in people. A different kind of knowing that wasn't there before. The old ones who cling to what their fathers told them and their fathers before them still remain but they're getting fewer, like dying embers in a cold hearth.\n\nAmong them that call themselves Christian there's going to be an awakening. Like water rising slow and steady in some ancient well. They'll start peeling away at what men added to the words. Layer by layer. Year by year. Maybe it'll take generations but it'll come sure as night follows day. The clock of time spinning backwards until there aint nothing left but what he said. What he meant. Before the others came with their own ideas about God.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the white man it'll wash clean the churches but wont destroy them. They'll still stand like weathered sentinels. But something strange will happen. All them differences between believers will start fading away like footprints in the sand when the tide comes in. History's got a way of turning back on itself. Like how Rome went from killing Christians to bowing before their cross. Or how this country went from keeping men in chains to letting them lead.\n\nYou go back far enough and there was just the Jews. That's where it all started. Before Christ walked the earth they had their one God and their holy books and their laws handed down since Moses' time. Back when Rome took Jerusalem in the year 63 before Christ the Jews weren't of one mind neither. They had their divisions. Sadducees. Pharisees. Essenes. Zealots. And then there was just the common folk, carrying their beliefs like stones in their pockets, wearing them smooth with worry and wonder.",
            "They was greed in them and it was a thing that could not be denied nor cast out. Like some darkness that dwelled in the heart of man since time was time. The Jungle showed this truth plain as day. Showed it in the way men conducted their affairs and in the way they turned their eyes from the suffering of others like it was nothing to them at all.\n\nThe factory men stood highest among these. Lords of their concrete kingdoms rising black against the sky, smoke pouring forth like the breath of some industrial beast. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing against the heavens, smoke streaming endless to the edge of the world as if God himself had blessed their venture. But there was no blessing in it. Only the slow poisoning of everything that drew breath.\n\nThey cared nothing for the workers that made their fortunes. Nothing for the men and women broken on the wheels of progress. The whole of Packingtown was nothing but a cauldron of hate and desperation where a man's worth was measured against a dollar and found wanting. They'd lay off hundreds without warning, casting them into the streets like so much offal. No law stood between the workers and their masters in them days. No protection from the speed-ups and the dangerous machines and the bone-grinding labor that left men dead before their time.\n\nThe people who lived and died there had no choice but to endure. Like chattel they was, bound to the factories by hunger and desperation. Foreign folks mostly, hanging by a thread over starvation's abyss, their fates tied to the whims of men no better than slave drivers of old. And like slavery it bred a particular kind of darkness in the soul. A corruption that spread through them streets like a disease, touching everything it encountered. Making monsters of men who might otherwise have been decent folk.\n\nThem factory owners stood atop it all like kings of old, counting their money while below them the masses suffered. They breathed different air than the working folk. Ate different food. Their children played in parks while the children of the workers played in gutters filled with offal and blood from the killing floors. That was the way of it. The natural order they'd created, as merciless as nature herself.",
            "In the darkened corridors of literary history there was a poem called Dream-land and Poe had writ it and called it among his finest works. The word Thulé lay buried in its verses like some ancient rune, appearing twice as though summoned from older tongues. Mabbott traced it back to Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, an isle north of Britain where the known world gave way to darkness and myth. But there were other wells from which such waters might have sprung.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like cold iron striking flame in the darkness of his thoughts. Goethe chief among them, his Faust a thing of terrible beauty published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the last in the year of his death, 1832. Within that second part lay \"The King of Thulé\" like a dark jewel. It told of a king whose queen had passed leaving him naught but a goblet and his grief. He drank deep of both till at last he cast the cup into the sea and followed after, his eyes closing on the world forever.\n\nThe shadows between these works ran deep as wells. Dream-land and The King of Thulé stood as mirror-dark reflections, each echoing loss and loneliness and the color leaching out of all things. The speaker in Dream-land walked as though he'd stepped into Goethe's world itself, seeing what that ancient king had seen, feeling what he had felt in those last moments on the cliff's edge.\n\nGoethe's name carried weight that even Poe could not ignore. When asked of Tennyson, Poe spoke of both men in the same breath, their words carrying across oceans and years in endless adaptations and tellings. The darkness in their verses called to his own, and in Dream-land that darkness found its echo, twice-told and terrible in its beauty.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and obligations but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that October evening eating his dinner while the applesauce lay spilled across the cold linoleum like some pale viscous blood. First came Wayne telling him of the danger and then Haddigan but he paid them no mind. The food was warm in his mouth and he had no time for such things. No time at all.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five walking the fluorescent aisles like a pilgrim in some retail wasteland. She didnt see the spill. How could she. The floor was slick and treacherous and she went down hard onto the tiles, her spine cracking like green wood in winter. Behind the security cameras watched with their dead glass eyes recording everything and nothing.\n\nThere had been others before her. Five souls who'd fallen in that same store that year alone. Their bodies hitting the floor like sacks of wet cement. Each time the manager had known. Each time he had chosen to look away. The law called it conscious disregard but it was something older than that. Something primitive and dark that lived in the spaces between duty and indifference.\n\nIn California the statutes spoke of punitive damages for acts committed with oppression fraud or malice. Cold words for cold deeds. The courts had ruled on such things before. They knew malice when they saw it. Knew it in the willful turning away from consequence. Knew it in the deliberate blindness to the rights of others. The manager had seen the danger coming like storm clouds on the horizon but he had chosen to let it come. Let whatever would happen happen.\n\nThe judge would have to look at it now. Would have to weigh the despicable nature of it. Six people fallen. Six bodies broken on his watch. The manager sitting in his office that evening spooning food into his mouth while danger waited in the aisles like some patient predator. No. This wasnt something that could be dismissed with the wave of a gavel. The malice lay there as plain as the spilled applesauce on the store floor. As plain as the broken woman who now sought her justice.",
            "The wanting had been there since she was fourteen. A hollow thing that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone now and still it gnawed at her like some dark beast crouched in the chambers of her heart. Not a thing she needed but someone. The boys came and went like pale ghosts. Their awkward advances met with silence. She studied herself in the mirror nights, questioning what darkness lay within that made her this way. No answers came.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her mother and father walked soft through the rooms like spirits themselves, rarely raising voices against each other or their daughter save when she blazed forth with that wild fire that burned in her. A fire they hadnt known the source of. She carried it like a torch through the world and folk were drawn to its light.\n\nBut this day the quiet broke. A scream tore through the morning air from the kitchen where her mother stood. The girl ran. Mama she called. Mama what is it. Her mother lay twisted on the tile floor making small animal sounds of pain. The girl knelt beside her and laid hands on her mothers shoulder. Hospital the mother said through gritted teeth. The girl gathered her up like a child, grateful for the strength in her arms, and carried her through the door to the waiting car.\n\nThe hospital reeked of spirits and sick folk and death but she paid it no mind. Carried her mother through the sliding doors calling out for help in a voice that echoed off the sterile walls. White coats descended like vultures. They took her mother away on a rolling bed and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry wasps.\n\nLater they told her how her mother had fallen reaching for some old pottery piece high up in the kitchen cabinets. As if such things mattered now. As if anything mattered but the soft rise and fall of her mothers chest in the hospital bed. The girl sat vigil through the night watching. Watching and waiting while outside the window the world spun on uncaring through the dark.",
            "They sought to know of hearts and their failings and of the old ways of eating that might keep a man from the darkness that comes with disease. The Mediterranean way they called it though it wasnt really about the sea at all but about the things that grew from the earth and the creatures that swam in those waters. The old people who lived there knew things about food that the modern world had forgotten. They ate the fruits of trees and grains from the field and fish from the waters and they drank wine in moderation as men have done since time out of mind.\n\nThey watched seventy four thousand women for twenty years. Nurses they were all of them. Each two years time they would write down what they ate and what they drank and the watchers would give them numbers based on how close they kept to the old ways. The women grew older. Some sickened and died. Some had their hearts give out and some had their minds stolen by clots in their brains that came silent and terrible in the night.\n\nThe watchers kept their vigil through all those years marking down in their books when one would fall. They checked the death papers and the hospital records and sometimes even the cut flesh itself to be certain of what had taken each one. When they could not be certain they marked it probable and kept counting anyway for that was all they could do.\n\nThey found that those who kept closest to the old ways were less likely to be taken. The numbers showed it clear as day. Of those who ate as their ancestors had eaten only seventy one of every hundred suffered what the others did. The rest were spared though no one could say why exactly. Perhaps it was the earth itself protecting those who still remembered how to eat of it properly. Perhaps it was something else entirely. Something older. Something that had been waiting in the blood since before men knew how to write such things down.\n\nThe numbers told their story but numbers are just shadows on paper and paper burns and shadows fade and in the end all that remains is what was and what wasnt and the long dark road between the two.",
            "The sign said Hitler lived in Burma and the girl held it overhead like some proclamation of doom. She stood alone on that corner in the gray morning light, the cardboard sign stark against the pallid sky. The words were writ in black marker, crude and prophetic.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of old temples and new terrors where men in olive drab had seized power years past, their rifles still warm from the taking. The monks came first in their robes color of flame and sunset. Saffron Revolution, they named it. As if revolution could be distilled to mere color. The people followed after, drawn to the monks like moths to fire until the streets filled with their prayers and their rage.\n\nThe junta watched and waited. Patient as serpents. Then they struck. They came in the night for the monasteries, boots on ancient stone, rifle butts splintering temple doors that had stood centuries. They gathered the foreign press like cattle, herded them into cells. One Japanese man lay dead in the street, his camera still clicking its last frames as his blood spread black on the pavement. Thirteen dead said the papers. But the colonel who fled spoke of thousands. Bodies stacked like cordwood in the jungle. The earth drinks deep of such offerings.\n\nIt was nothing new under the sun. Since men first built walls they sought to rule what lay within them. Roman emperors crowned themselves with divinity. Japanese kings claimed celestial birth. Even now our leader takes counsel from prophets of folly, their words carried on wires across the continent like the muttering of ghosts.\n\nThe dead keep their own accounts. In China they gathered in the square that June, students and workers crying freedom into the dawn until the tanks came grinding through the night. Two hundred said the state. Three thousand said the truth. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, neighbor against neighbor until the streets ran red. And before them all came Hitler with his camps and his chambers and his dream of racial purity bought with smoke and ash.\n\nThe girl stood holding her sign. The wind moved her hair. Above, the sky threatened rain. Some truths cant be buried, no matter how deep you dig the grave.",
            "He sat at that piano like a man possessed of something darker than mere talent. The legacy of Duke Ellington aint just in the years he spent making that music but in how he shaped and molded them players like clay in his hands. His own playing was quiet. Subtle. Like whispers in the night. But when he wrote them pieces they came out rich and complex as blood, each one crafted special for them men who played em.\n\nHe knew what each man could do. Knew it deep in his bones. Built frameworks where they could blow free as birds but then hed write these tight orchestrated parts that called on what was particular to each player. Something in their soul that needed telling. The whole orchestra had a sound like nothing else in this world. Original. Pure. Each piece different but carrying that same blood through its veins.\n\nTake that Creole Love Call. Voice used like any other instrument might be. No words to get in the way of what needed saying. Six parts to it like this:\n\nFirst theres that call and response tween voice and reeds. Smooth at first then turning rough like old leather. Then comes a muted trumpet crying out blue notes that'd break your heart. High clarinet floating over piano next, then the whole band taking up that first theme again. Fifth part building like a storm with them reeds calling high and brass answering like thunder. Last part going back to where it started, voice turning to something else entirely. Something that growled like some night creature. Brief ending like a whispered goodbye.\n\nHot and Bothered came later. Miley on that muted trumpet speaking back and forth with Baby Cox's voice, neither one quite human nor quite instrument but something in between. It Don't Mean a Thing brought Nanton in, man they called Tricky Sam, working that trombone like it was speaking in tongues.\n\nThis was the sound of something being born in American music. Something that hadnt been there before and wouldnt never be there quite the same way again. Dark and beautiful and terrible all at once. Like watching the sun go down on the last day of the world.",
            "He sat there studying the shell like some ancient thing pulled from the earth's deep memory. The whorl of it spiraling through time and space like the thoughts of dead men. Like the thoughts of God himself. The columella running through its heart like a spine, each turn marking the passage of time in calcium and death. He knew there were laws to such things. Mathematical certainties that men like Thompson had tried to capture with numbers and equations back in 1917 though they might as well have been trying to measure the soul.\n\nThe shell lay there in the pale light. Its aperture gazing up like some blind eye, each whorl growing larger as it spiraled outward from that first beginning, that point where life had started its slow accretion of being. The sutures between each turn marked clear as property lines on some dead man's map. Body whorl fat and final like the period at the end of a death sentence.\n\nHe turned it in his hands. Apical view showing the spiral from above, then basal, then apertural with its opening like a mouth frozen mid-speech. Could count the whorls if you knew how. Draw a line through its heart and follow the spiral out, marking quarter turns like time on some cosmic clock.\n\nThe trajectory of it all could be mapped. Could be measured and marked with numbers that meant something to men who believed such things could be contained in mathematics. But he knew better. Knew that evolution moved like water over stone, wearing away at the edges of possibility until something new emerged from the darkness. Like those Prunum shells they studied with their X-rays and computers, trying to divine the boundaries of what could be from what was.\n\nThe shell sat heavy in his hand. Each whorl a perfect geometric progression through space, each turn following laws old as stone. Laws that men like Stone tried to capture in programs like CerioShell, thinking they could model life's possibilities like architects planning cities. But the truth was in the shell itself. In the cold calcium spiral that had once housed life, now empty as a desert church.\n\nHe set it down gentle as laying a child to rest. The mathematics of it all meant nothing really. Just men trying to measure the immeasurable, to contain the infinite in finite terms. The shell would keep its secrets. Would stay mute as bone while men scratched equations in the dust, trying to understand why life moves as it does through the long dark of time.",
            "They sat there in the dim light of the office studying the numbers on the page. Numbers that told of death. Of children lost. Of mothers gone. Indonesia. A place far off where the sun rose first and where death stalked the villages and towns like some dark specter that would not rest.\n\nTen years gone and nothing changed. The dying went on. While some things got better like water and ways to keep clean the children kept dying and the mothers too. Too many to count. Too many to bear. He looked at the paper again. The reasons written there in black ink that told nothing of the truth of it.\n\nSeventy-two percent they said. Birth helpers there to catch the babies as they came into the world. But these weren't doctors. Just women who knew the old ways. When the blood came they could do nothing but watch it flow. Watch the mothers slip away into that dark country from which no traveler returns.\n\nIn the cities things were better. Seven births cut from the belly for every hundred. In the country only two. The numbers told their own story. The rich lived. The poor died. Twenty-seven percent difference between them that had and them that didn't. Money bought life. Always had.\n\nHe thought about the programs they wanted to build. Vertical they called them. Like towers reaching up into nothing. But you couldn't build towers without foundations and the foundations weren't there. The system was broken. Had always been broken. Would stay broken until someone fixed it proper.\n\nThey'd seen it before. Money flowing like water into one thing. AIDS they called it. Death by another name. While the family planning dried up and blew away like dust in the wind. People followed the money. Always had. Always would. Made more paperwork. More forms. More ways to count the dead.\n\nThe numbers stared back at him from the page. Cold. Implacable. Like the eyes of something that lived in the deep dark places of the earth. Something that fed on suffering. On death. On the tears of mothers holding their dead children. He folded the paper and put it away. Some things you couldn't fix with numbers. Some things you couldn't fix at all.",
            "The dark waters of popular music run deep and cold now, deeper than any man could count in years. A hundred winters have passed and still the genres multiply like vermin in the night, breeding new forms that crawl forth into the light. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, each one spawning bastard children of their own, sub-genres writhing beneath sub-genres until the names mean nothing at all.\n\nBut it was Heavy Metal that grew the blackest roots, spreading like some malignant vine through forty years of American soil. They say it speaks in tongues of darkness, voices that carry pain and rage and something older still. Something that was there before the music, before the instruments, before the men who played them.\n\nThe metal came like a storm in the night and when it passed nothing was the same. Men took what they found in its wake and forged new sounds, hammered them into shapes that had no names. Now the metal runs in so many streams that no man can say where one ends and another begins. To know the truth of it you got to go back to the source, back to where it first came bubbling up from the ground like black oil.\n\nMetal carries darkness in its bones. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the strings, more blood in the throat of every singer. These weren't no primitive howlers neither. These were craftsmen who knew their tools like a hunter knows his rifle. And there were drugs too, oh yes. Mid-seventies saw a flood of chemicals that turned men's minds inside out, made them see things that weren't there and hear music that hadn't existed before. They blamed it on the drugs but the darkness was in them all along, waiting.\n\nThe old music had been afraid to look into that darkness. But metal stared right into it, reached in and pulled out something raw and bleeding. Like them old Romantic composers who wrote about death and devils, only now it came through amplifiers tall as men, through speakers that could shatter glass. Even the Beatles caught that fever. Their song Helter Skelter came crawling out like something born in a cave, all teeth and hunger. They'd heard what the Stones were doing and wanted to prove they could swim in those same black waters. They did too, though some say that's where the trouble started.",
            "He came before them all, before them dreampainters with their wild visions, Henri Rousseau crafting his own dreams both in sleep and wake. The Dream they called it, made in 1910, showing a woman laid bare in wonderment at some savage paradise, but it was Rousseau's own dreaming too that lived there on that canvas. Recognition he sought, acceptance from them that made art and them that loved it, but the path to such things was dark and winding and full of thorns.\n\nThe Dream stood testament to his struggle, that war between conforming to what others wanted and walking alone down his own dark road. Born in Laval in 1844 to a tinsmith who had some money but not much else. No schooling in art did he receive, worked forty years as a gabelou collecting coins at the town gates though they called him douanier like he was something more than he was. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground, leaving him with just Julia and a grief that sat in his chest like a stone. Painting became his refuge, his escape from the darkness that surrounded him.\n\nHe wasnt like them other painters who made pretty pictures of peasants with their romantic notions. He was of the folk and painted like the folk, carrying their hopes in his hands like water. His wanting to be accepted by them art folk was a thing you could understand if you looked at it right. No education had he in the ways of painting and was old when he started, working alongside them that had made names for themselves already.\n\nMatisse was rising then, when Rousseau finally got some notice. Gordon wrote in his book about modern French painters that these two men were different as night and day. Matisse feared painting like others painted while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make pictures so proper and right that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy for men like him, men who carry dreams in their pockets like copper pennies, hoping someday they might turn to gold.",
            "He sat there thinking on them that came before, them that spoke of truth and beauty being bound together like twins in the womb. Couldn't say why exactly but he reckoned there was something to it. Old Keats had written it down plain as day on some Greek pot, said beauty was truth and truth was beauty and that was all any man needed to know in this world. Most things a man learns come from books or hard living but these things, these notions of right and wrong and what makes something fine to look at, they come from somewhere deeper. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how folk try to explain these things, breaking them down into little pieces like a butcher with a carcass. They'd take apart a painting or a deed and name all its parts but never get to the heart of it. Like that painting of the woman with the strange smile. People talked about light and shadow and history but none of that told you why it made your chest tight to look at it. Most times when you asked someone why they loved some piece of art they'd just say there was something about it, something they couldn't put their finger on. Like trying to describe the taste of water.\n\nO'Connor, she knew. Said some things couldn't be told straight out, had to come sideways through a story. No matter how many words you used there was always something left over, something that wouldn't get caught in the net of language. Same with knowing right from wrong. That Austrian fella Wittgenstein said you couldn't even speak it proper, said it was beyond words altogether.\n\nThe connection twixt the two, between what's right and what's beautiful, it lived in that space beyond words. Hit you in a place you couldn't point to, like a ghost touching your heart. Books though, they was different. McKean had it right when he said books was special cause they carried the weight of living in them. Values, he called them. Said that's what made books matter, cause they showed us how to be human in a world that sometimes forgot what that meant.\n\nSitting there in the growing dark he thought on all this. Thought about how some truths was like smoke, visible but impossible to hold. How beauty and goodness was tied together like a knot that couldn't be undone. And maybe that's all any man needed to know.",
            "The land stretches vast and cold beneath a gray sky that hangs like a burial shroud from München to the dark waters of Kiel. A country now but once it was nothing but blood and soil and the ghosts of ancient tribes that walked these grounds. The culture moves like a river through the heart of it all, from Köln where the Rhine cuts deep to Dresden where the Elbe winds slow and methodical through stone.\n\nThey called it Germania once. The old ones did. The name itself lost to time and the whispers of dead scholars who argued its meaning in candlelit rooms now turned to dust. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians, how they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Caesar knew them too. Called them Germanus in his writings, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Roman boots. Some say the word meant neighbor in the tongue of the Gauls. Others speak of spears called ger, or the battle cry that split the air like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote more. His words scratched onto parchment in 98 AD telling of a people pure as winter snow, untouched by the blood of others. Who would come here, he asked, to this wild land of bitter skies and darker hearts? Only those born to it. Only those who knew nothing else.\n\nThe Romans came though. Came and went like storms across the land, taking what they could carry, leading men to die in foreign soil. But they always returned to their marble columns and paved roads, leaving Germania to those who knew its ways. The tribes lived on the edge of empire, trading forest gold and warrior blood, serving in legions not their own while the years turned slow as millstones grinding all to dust.",
            "The play stretched out before him like some vast tapestry of deception and truth woven together in threads of gold and shadow. He watched it unfold in his mind, the way disguise worked its dark magick through the characters like a slow poison or a balm depending on how you held it to the light. Truth was they all wore masks. Every last one of them. And underneath those masks lay other masks still, peeling away layer by layer until what remained was either salvation or damnation.\n\nHe thought about Viola mostly. How she'd shed her woman's skin like a snake in winter, taking on man's flesh not out of want but necessity. The foreign shore had teeth and she knew it. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she'd said, voice already changing like the tide, \"Where lie my maiden weeds.\" Protection, yes. But protection carries its own price.\n\nThe deception worked its way through the story like a dark river cutting through stone. It isolated her from the women, left her adrift in a sea of complications. Olivia's love came at her sideways, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" Words thrown like stones across still water. And Orsino with his thousand declarations, never knowing the truth that stood before him in borrowed clothes: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nHe considered how the modern eye might see it different. How deception sometimes forces truth from its hiding place like smoke from a burrow. Olivia's desire for Cesario might mean something deeper, something hidden beneath the surface like old bones in river mud. But more likely it spoke to the foolishness of those who judge by the shell and not the meat within. When Sebastian appeared she transferred her love quick as summer lightning, and Cesario became sister instead of lover: \"A sister, you are she.\" Simple as that. Clean as a knife cut.\n\nThe truth was masks served their purpose until they didn't. Then they had to fall away like dead skin or they'd grow into the flesh permanent-like, and a person would forget what lay beneath. That was the real danger. Not the wearing but the forgetting.",
            "They called it German rule but there wasnt nothing German about the dead. The Ovaherero. The Nama. Names like cold stones in the mouth. Dust and bones scattered in that hardscrabble land where the empire had come and gone like some dark caravan bearing death in its wagons. But empires aint built on simple things and this was no different. Each colony carved from earth and blood had its own way. Its own truth.\n\nIn the east they found them reading. Africans with books in their hands like relics from some forgotten time. The British who came after spoke of it. How the Germans had built schools there. How they had taught them. But in the southwest there was nothing. Just mission houses scattered like broken teeth in a dead mans skull where the churches did what they could with what little they had. The Germans built fine schools there too but they werent for the natives. No. They were for the white children. The settlers children. Their bloodline preserved in brick and mortar while the African children watched from beyond the fence where their futures lay scattered in the dust like spent cartridges.\n\nHe thought about the numbers sometimes. Fifteen thousand whites in the southwest by 1913. More than anywhere else in their African holdings. The climate drew them like flies to meat. Not gentle but livable. Desert stretched its fingers across the land but a man could survive there. Could build something. But what they built was a wall. A wall between knowing and not knowing. Between reading and not reading. Between being and not being.\n\nThe books told it different ways. Most in German text, written when the empire still breathed. Later the English came with their own tellings. Their own comparisons. Cohen wrote of it. How the settlers made the difference. How their presence shaped everything like wind shapes stone. But there was more to it than that. There always is. Dark truths buried in darker soil. Waiting.\n\nIn the east they learned. In the west they didnt. Simple as that but nothing is simple. Nothing at all.",
            "They called it fifty-seven years. From eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three the blood flowed between them like some ancient biblical curse. Two nations locked in their death dance across the desert wastes. America and Mexico. Each carrying their own god in their teeth like mad dogs.\n\nThe war came in forty-six. American boots marking time across Mexican soil while the desert sun watched indifferent and cruel. When it was done Texas lay in American hands and with it the great southwestern wastes. But the blood didnt stop there. It wouldnt stop for years yet.\n\nThey were different peoples carrying different gods. The Americans with their protestant prayers and the Mexicans with their Catholic saints. Like old world hatreds carried across the sea in the holds of wooden ships. The English and Spanish had passed down their ancient feuds like some dark inheritance and now their children played out those old wars in new lands.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed proper in those years. Border raids and frontier justice dealing death in small measures. Bandits and outlaws moving like wraiths across the invisible lines men had drawn in the sand. Lines meant nothing to them. They killed and stole and vanished back across the border leaving nothing but ash and bone behind.\n\nThe rivalry died slow like everything else in that hard country. Mexico grew dependent on American gold and the American dream changed from land to commerce. Some things dont die clean. They linger like ghosts haunting the margins of ledger books and trade agreements. The desert remembers though. Every drop of blood spilled there marks the sand forever and the wind carries the memories of dead men in its teeth.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most things that take you down but swift and merciless as a hangman's drop. I didn't even know such afflictions existed in the world.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety, the kind that never came in childhood. They'd tell you nursing was sure as sunrise. People getting sick and dying, that's what people do. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the sick and dying. Like making a deal with death himself.\n\nNow here I was. Forty-six years gone from birth, alone in the world save for my affliction, bank account empty as a desert well. Fifteen years living off the government's mercy and everything I ever called mine has turned to dust. Each dawn brings its own war against fear and worthlessness. Nothing certain anymore except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth that stands like bedrock: without my blood kin and the few true souls who stayed, I'd have been carried off by the dark waters long ago. When disaster comes it strips you bare, leaves you naked as a newborn in the cold world.\n\nLife's got its ambush points. No map shows where they lay waiting. You can fill your storehouse to the rafters but some storms are too big for one soul to weather alone.\n\nThese days folks talk about standing alone against the world, like them pioneers who crossed the mountains west. But that ain't the truth of it. What kept them wagon trains rolling wasn't the strength of one man but the bonds between many. Compassion and respect, the sharing of what little they had. Nobody crossed them mountains alone.\n\nSo yes, keep your disaster kit. Stack your canned goods and matches. Lay in water tablets and medical supplies like you're preparing for the end times. Plant your garden if you've got the ground for it. But while you're building your fortress against what's coming, remember this: know your neighbor's face. Learn their story. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't gonna be you alone against it. It'll be all of us or none.",
            "In the old world before the old world there was a prince. They called him Buddha later but that wasnt his name then. He walked out of his palace one day and never went back. Found something in himself that wasnt there before. Something that burned like a coal in the deepest part of night. Twenty five hundred years gone now and the religion he built stands different. Changed. In Sri Lanka they cut the water every year. Some ceremony. Monks in their robes like old ghosts moving through the current. Buddha never spoke of such things but there it is all the same. The changes run deeper than ceremony. Run down to the marrow of what they believe. What they think will save them.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Like a sickness. Some meant harm and others didnt care either way but the changes came all the same. Inside the walls of their temples the monks watched it happen. Outside the merchants and farmers and all manner of men watched too. Some fought it. Others didnt.\n\nAt the heart of it all three things. Buddha himself. The Dhamma which is their holy word written in three parts. The Sangha which is their church if you could call it that. The books tell em what they need to know. How to live. What rules to follow. What lies behind the veil of the world. They say theres no soul. Say life is suffering. Say nothing lasts. Round and round they go dying and being born again until they figure it out. Until they shake off want and hate and being blind to what is real.\n\nThe monks got their rules and the common folk got theirs. Five things they cant do. Cant kill. Cant lie. Cant steal. Cant do wrong with their bodies. Cant poison their minds with drink or worse things. But at the bottom of it all four truths like old stones in a dry riverbed. Life is pain. Want causes pain. Pain can end. Theres a way out if youre strong enough to take it."
