            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Two men arguing the same truth and we got to parse em out and see which stands truest but we cant spend time wondering on different gods or spirits or whatever demons men conjure in the dark.

            "The words lay there like bones bleached in the sun, each one carrying its own weight of meaning.

They was uniformity. White being what the rich folk wrapped themselves in, gray being what was left when the white wore down. He laid this meaning down early, careful like a man laying traps.

They came to walk the paths between the crops, to watch the birds wheel overhead, to pretend at some communion with the land that their ancestors had known without thinking.\n\nBut the cost was blood and sweat. What chemicals once did now fell to human hands. The weeds and the insects came as they always had, mindless and hungry. Small farms fought against the giants that fed the masses, every day a battle against economics and entropy. Some planted cover crops or moved their cattle in patterns old as time. They pulled the invading plants and shaped the land to their will, creating edges and openings where the wild things might persist.\n\nThe creatures that remained were fewer now. The kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that danced like scraps of colored paper in the wind. The gnatcatcher that sang its thin song in the dawn. Their names appeared on lists of the vanishing, as if naming them might halt their passing from the world.\n\nHe stood at the edge of the property and looked out over what remained. The ghosts of the natives and the ranchers and the woodcutters moved through the trees like smoke. The sun beat down as it had always done. The land endured. It asked nothing and gave nothing freely. But it remained, waiting for those who would work it with respect, who would balance the needs of commerce with the ancient ways. The programs existed now, help for those who would try. But in the end it came down to the same thing it always had. A person. The land. And what might grow between them.",
            "Brothers carry a bond between them that aint nothing else like it in this world. Something raw and ancient like old stone. Something that cant be broke nor bent nor changed. Inside that bond there's love sure enough but pride too and jealousy and meanness and cruelty all mixed up together like ash and blood. Brothers know each other in ways nobody else could know. When they look at each other they're seein themselves reflected back like in some dark mirror. And when the world turns mean and violent that's when you see what kind of bond it truly is. Good or evil it dont matter. The truth of it comes out like something pulled from deep water, dripping and cold.\n\nThe consequences of them feelings between brothers they carry a terrible weight. Like stones in your pockets dragging you down into the dark. When you look your brother in the eye and see yourself staring back its like looking into your own soul laid bare. Not how others might see you but how you truly are in the deepest part of yourself. Your true nature shows itself in what you do and what comes after.\n\nIn this story called The Scarlet Ibis there's two brothers walking this path together. They move through a world thats green and wet and alive with things dying. These boys they set out on a journey that aint going nowhere good. Pride and disappointment clash like thunder and when its done only one of them is left breathing the air of this world. You see it all through the eyes of the older brother watching his crippled younger brother called Doodle and how he sees the world around him. Everything he does comes from that seeing.\n\nThe older brother he's eaten up with pride like some kind of poison. From the first time he takes that broken little brother of his outside till their last terrible day together he's carrying this resentment inside him like a hot coal. He wanted him a brother could do all the things boys do. Running and climbing and swimming. Racing through the swamp and sitting up in the highest branches of the pine trees. But Doodle he was born with a heart that wasnt no good. Doctors said he probably wouldnt live and if he did he'd never do none of them things his brother dreamed about.\n\nThat knowledge it sat in the older boy's gut like something rotten. He even thought about killing that baby. Smothering him with a pillow while everyone else was sleeping. What kind of darkness lives in a child to think such things. But then that baby smiled at him and something in that smile melted whatever meanness was in his heart. Maybe he never really meant to do it. Maybe there was love there all along just waiting to show itself.",
            "The human mind aint nothing but a dark and terrible machine grinding away in the skull of every man woman and child that ever drew breath on this earth. In them old times they reckoned it was like marks on wax or words writ on paper but now they speak of it like them computers humming in their glass towers. All of it wrong somehow. Wrong in ways that cant be named.\n\nThe world comes at you raw and bleeding. Light and sound and the feel of things all turned to lightning in the flesh and bone. The mind takes these things and works them over like some demented craftsman. Bottom up they call it when the pieces come together slow, a black box rising from white paper like some geometric specter. Top down when the knowing comes fast and sure like a knife. The box is there or maybe it aint. Maybe its a hole cut into the white like a window into nothing.\n\nSomething in there decides what matters. Like a demon sorting souls. The grass beneath your feet processed but forgotten, unnamed and unremembered, but your name floating across a crowded room catches like a fishhook in the meat of your brain. The processing goes on and on, circles within circles, wheels turning in the dark.\n\nMemory is a kind of violence done to time. Sensory memory, working memory, long term memory, each one a different kind of wound. Words get carved three ways - the shape of them like dead things on paper, the sound like ghost voices in empty rooms, and the meaning like some terrible truth you cant forget. They say working memory is electricity running through the brain like lightning trapped in a bottle, twenty seconds worth of thunder. Long term memory lives in the protein and the bone, written in a language older than words.\n\nThe knowing gets stored like a spiders web, everything connected to everything else. Chair to table to wood to tree to forest to fire to ash and back again. Each thought bound to the next with threads fine as silk and strong as steel wire. This is what they call the semantic network but its older than that. Older than words or numbers or anything with a name. Old as thinking itself. Old as pain.",
            "The money died in 2007. It died slow and it died hard and when it was done dying there wasnt much left of anything at all. The houses stood empty and the banks stood empty too and men walked the streets with cardboard signs telling of their hunger. They had no work and no home to return to and the signs they carried grew wet in the rain until the words ran like tears down the cardboard faces.\n\nHe remembered how it started. Back in the time of Clinton. Back when men thought they could make something from nothing and the nothing would sustain them forever. They wrote papers saying poor folk could buy houses they couldn't afford and the papers got passed around like bibles in a church. Each man taking his share of the collection plate. Each man blessing what ought not be blessed.\n\nThe houses they built were like a fever dream. Rows of them standing naked in the sun with their windows like blind eyes looking out on streets where no children played. They made paper from these houses. Paper that promised wealth beyond counting. Paper that promised safety. They called these papers by names that no common man could understand. CDOs and CDSs. Like runes scratched in the dirt by witch doctors. Like curses written in the blood of the economy itself.\n\nWhen it all fell it fell hard. Like a hanged man at the end of his rope. The banks that had stood like granite temples fell into dust. Bear Stearns. Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers. Names that had meant power now meant nothing at all. Four trillion in debt. Numbers so big they lost all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in a desert. Like measuring the depth of a bottomless pit.\n\nThe government came in at the end. Like undertakers come to dress the corpse. They gathered up what was left of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Five trillion more in debt. A number that would break the back of God himself. They put these broken things in boxes and buried them deep where no one could see their shame. But the shame was there all the same. Written in the faces of the men who had lost everything. Written in the empty windows of the houses where no one lived. Written in the very stones of the earth itself.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached white in desert sun. Story bones. Character bones. All of them scattered and lifeless without the meat to bind them. Without the blood to make them sing.\n\nHe'd seen it before. Writers who'd dump their histories like corpses in shallow graves. Quick to bury the past so they could get on with what they thought was living. But the past aint never buried deep enough. It comes back. Always does.\n\nShow dont tell, they'd say. As if words were that simple. As if you could parse the world into such clean divisions. But the world aint clean and it aint simple and sometimes telling is all you got. But telling aint the same as knowing.\n\nTake the man at the gas station. Night manager with tired eyes who'd seen things in the Air Force he wouldn't speak of. Two wedding rings in a drawer somewhere gathering dust like dead moons. No children to carry his name. Just him and his fishing pole on weekends, casting lines into dark waters hoping to pull something true from the depths. Dreams of owning the place someday, though he'd never admit it. Eggs Benedict cooling on a plate while he watches the sun come up through windows smeared with time and grease.\n\nBut that aint the story. That's just the bones of it. The real story's in how his hands shake when planes fly overhead. How he touches the empty space on his finger where gold used to be. How he stares at that gas station sign like it's some kind of beacon in the dark. You got to give the reader something to hold onto. Something that bleeds when you cut it.\n\nBecause in the end all we got is what we show each other. All we got is the meat and muscle and sinew that makes these story bones dance. Without that they're just words on a page. Dead things. And there's enough dead things in this world already.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the television flickered blue against the wall. Two broadcasts from Columbus. The first showed a man's face, evil and stark, name of Hostettler. He'd put a knife to his wife in Ashley, done it multiple times till the blood ran black. They gave it two minutes. That was all.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years and shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The news gave it short shrift, like they always done with colored folk. White victims get the air time, their faces plastered cross the screen like saints in a church. Others just fade away like smoke in the wind.\n\nThey talked about a hole in a Med-Flight bird, clean through. Twenty-two caliber from somewhere in the dark below. Five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. Money talks but the streets stay quiet.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder rolling in from the west like God's own fury. Eighty degrees they said, teasing it out like bait on a line.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark-skinned man they said, tall and lean, hundred fifty pounds in a hooded shirt. They lingered on his color like it was written in stone, carved deep and permanent.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, Texas man dealing in marijuana. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years like normal folk would say. Hispanic, they made sure to mention, though it didn't matter none. Just words floating in the ether, meaningless as ash.\n\nThe news droned on but the stories were always the same. Just different names for the dead and dying, for the criminals and their victims, all of them moving through the world like ghosts, barely touching it before they're gone.",
            "He studied the paper before him, numbers stark and merciless as bones bleached in desert sun. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the ancient ones but everything to those who moved money like water through invisible channels in the sky. He thought about how men had once traded gold and silver, things you could hold in your hand. Now it was all ghosts and whispers.\n\nThe document lay there like a dead thing. Symbols and percentages scattered across it like the aftermath of some financial apocalypse. Ten holdings, they called them. Top ten. As if numbers could be ranked like soldiers in some corporate army. Each one carrying its weight in the endless war of profit and loss.\n\nHe reached for his calculator. An old thing, battery-powered, surviving like a relic from another age. The numbers came slow and deliberate. Beta values. Returns. Standard deviations. Each calculation like a prayer to some nameless god of commerce. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, the IHF. Six point eleven percent higher. Numbers dont lie, he thought. They just wait.\n\nThe beta came lower too. Point twelve lower than the whole. He wrote it down careful, like a man marking the location of water in a wasteland. Statistical significance waited in the shadows like a thief. The standard deviations would tell that tale, but not today. Not yet.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men spoke of it like salvation. Spreading risk thin across the earth like butter on bread. But the numbers told a different story. The top ten holdings stood alone, proud and defiant against the broader fund. Better returns. Lower risk. The math was there, cold and clean as winter morning.\n\nIn the end it was all just numbers on paper. Symbols representing the hopes and fears of men who never touched the things they owned. He folded the paper carefully and put it in his desk. Tomorrow there would be more numbers. There were always more numbers. The market was eternal and merciless, like God himself.",
            "Looking back at that cold chart marked Figure 17 there was a falling off. A dying. Numbers dropping like dead birds from winter branches in that third month and we stood witness, helpless. No way to know the why of it though a man might reckon some. Winter come harsh to New England like it always did, cutting deep into the bones of bicycle riders and footwalkers alike, sending them scurrying to their automobiles warm and waiting. December brought its own kind of death too. The death of semesters, of papers needing grades, of tasks piling up like cordwood. The logging of miles traveled becoming ghost thoughts in tired minds.\n\nThe holidays came then, carried off the students and the teachers both, campus standing empty and cold as an abandoned church. Late January brought them trickling back but February stood stark in its silence, numbers low as valleys in that heartless chart. Some might say it was natural, the way excitement dies like embers growing cold, but we weren't ready to let it go. Created us something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, trying to breathe life back into dying coals. It worked some. Numbers rose like smoke signals against that gray sky but we knew the truth of what we faced.\n\nTruth was we were fighting something deeper than winter, deeper than semester breaks. Fighting the American heart itself, that wild thing that loves the freedom of four wheels and an open road. We tried to tame it with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and books, for hands that could work the tension from tired shoulders. But maybe we needed bigger bait. A bicycle gleaming like hope itself. A hybrid car humming with promise. Electric motors whispering of future days.\n\nThe prizes we gave stayed the same throughout, like a river that doesn't know to grow. Should have made them rise like flood waters. Should have let word spread of bicycles coming in December, of cars clean as morning light waiting in January. Might have kept them coming then. Might have seen numbers rise instead of watching them fall away like leaves in that New England winter.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared and reappeared like spirits conjured up from some long dead world.\n\nThe pictures all bore the same marks. Like they'd been birthed from the same dark womb. Stage-bound things they were, shot straight on like some theatrical performance, the camera fixed and dead still as stone. No movement save what moved within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all there was. One shot was all you got. One shot was all you needed back then. Except for them few that came later. Them few that dared different.\n\nHe studied how they'd made em. All inside like that. Boxed in their little wooden stages like prisoners. Camera staring straight on like the eye of God. Everything moving sideways like creatures caught between walls. Never coming forward. Never going back. Like that picture of Uncle Josh in that haunted hotel. Year was 1900. Josh coming in from the right like some frightened animal and scuttling back and forth across that wooden stage. Camera just watching. Dead still. Indifferent.\n\nThat's how they all was. Long shots mostly. Sometimes medium. Never close. Never getting near enough to see the truth in their eyes. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some vast dark theater. Actors keeping their distance like they was afraid of something. Afraid maybe of getting too close to whatever was watching them through that glass eye.\n\nMost of these pictures was just one shot. One minute of time captured and held forever in that silver light. Magic tricks mostly. People appearing. Disappearing. Changing into other things. No story to speak of. Just illusions. Like that one of Mary Queen of Scots. Year was 1895. Watch close enough and you can see where they stopped it. Where they switched the real woman for the dummy. Where they brought the ax down. But they didn't want you to see that part. Wanted you to believe in the magic. The way people do.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again. Thats what Watt said anyway in his book about such things. Some men praised it and others cursed it and called it shallow while others yet spoke of its terrible beauty like Burke done. But it was Walpole who birthed the first true Gothic story in that castle of his, taking what was ancient and modern both and forging something nobody had seen before. Like a blacksmith hammering out some new implement from scraps of iron both old and new.\n\nHe took them old theatre ways and mixed em with what folk called natural writing and made something that weren't quite either. The word Gothic itself was already worn smooth as river rock from being passed around to mean this thing or that - old buildings, ancient peoples, times long past. Folk looked down their noses at it, called it primitive against their modern ways. But there was something in that marriage of theatrical Gothic and this new thing called novels that let a reader see into the dark spaces of a man's mind. Something that wouldn't die. Something that was both ancient as the hills and fresh as morning dew.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run deep in these Gothic tales like roots in hard ground. In Walpole's castle story you can see how he took them old knight's codes and twisted em new. Them writers, Walpole particular, they saw something missing in their own time. Something noble that had gone out of the world. They looked back at them knights with their honor and their bravery like men dying of thirst might look at water. Made it all shine prettier than it ever was, truth be told. Romantic-like.\n\nWalpole, he was deep in the muck of politics when he wrote his tale. Seen things that made him doubt mankind's goodness. Maybe he reckoned that old Gothic times held something pure that had leaked out of the world drop by drop, leaving nothing but dry dust behind. You can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic. Before you even meet the man you know him by the marks of chivalry he bears like old scars. A prince who's suffered and been changed by it. Said to have fallen to infidels in some far land. The whole thing drawn larger than life like a shadow at sunset, all excess and darkness stretching long across the ground.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was invented by a man named Oliver in a time when such things still had names and still meant something to those that spoke them. He wrote it down. The planning. The doing. The watching. All of it writ in ledgers now lost to time.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production and supply. Inventory. Location. The moving of things. And last the knowing of things. These are the bones of it. The skeleton on which hangs all commerce in the world.\n\nFirst comes the making. Without the making there aint nothing else to follow. Manager men with clipboards and tired eyes study the wanting of people. What they'll buy. What they'll trade their hours for. They watch the market like old seers reading entrails, trying to divine what will come. Where to build. How many to build. Which plants will birth which things. It's all numbers to them. Cold arithmetic of profit and loss.\n\nHe'd seen it himself. In the stores where the fluorescent lights hummed like living things. Walmart. Target. Each with its own bible of rules. How to dress. How to move. How to stack the boxes when they came off the trucks in the dark hours. Everything written down like scripture. Without these words there was only chaos.\n\nThen comes supply. The choices of what can be done here and what must be sent away. Managers moving pieces on a board like generals in some bloodless war. Some work stays. Some work goes to distant places where hands are cheaper and the machines never sleep. They call it velocity. A word that means the speed of money moving through the world. But it aint really about speed. It's about the hunger. The endless hunger of the market that must be fed.\n\nThe whole thing moves like some great machine. Pieces interlocked. Gears turning gears. And at the center of it all sits man with his ledgers and his wants. Trying to make order of a world that don't want ordering.",
            "They wrote of parlors and teacups in them days but two books stood apart like dark prophets in the wastes. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Books that carried in them something older and more terrible than the mannered society they was meant to chronicle. Something that spoke of mystery and madness both.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams in his fever and they was dreams what showed the truth of things. Truth about what he was and what had been done to him by men with no souls. He lay there in his blood watching Sikes and Crackit argue like specters in the dark. Their voices carried to him across some terrible divide between what was real and what wasnt. Then the gunshot came again like it always did. Always would. Sound of it echoing off the walls of his skull while lights danced before him like corpsefire. Someone carried him away but he didnt know who. Might have been the devil himself. Pain followed him through it all like some dark companion that wouldnt leave him be.\n\nTime itself went strange in them books. Day wasnt day no more and night wasnt night. Hours stretched out like tar then snapped back quick as a whip. Silence came down heavy as a shroud then broke apart into madness. Time itself had gone wrong in a world where such things could happen to children. Where evil men could work their will on the innocent and God just watched from his high place, saying nothing.\n\nThe boy had no power over any of it. No more than a leaf has power over the wind. Forces bigger than him was at work and they was dark forces indeed. Old Fagin had started to break him like you'd break a wild horse. Teaching him that resistance was pointless in a world gone wrong. Teaching him that hope was for fools. The boy was learning his lessons well. Too well maybe. Learning to accept the darkness rather than fight it. Learning to let the world have its way with him cause fighting only brought more pain.",
            "He'd worked with the children in them days after school let out. Teaching them what he could though his knowledge ran mostly to letters and words and such. One of them teachers had come to him about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third grade maybe fourth. The boy couldn't read and there was something peculiar in the way of it. Some letters the boy knew true as truth itself but others might as well have been ciphers writ in ash for all he could make of them. The boy was Mexican or something like it though he spoke English pure as spring water.\n\nThey worked at it for days until the boy's mother came. She'd walked in while he watched the stragglers, them other children being gone on some venture elsewhere. The woman spoke no English. None. He tried what Spanish he knew which wasnt much, scraping together words like a man gathering kindling in the dark. Then the truth of it came to him like revelation. The boy could read right enough. Just not in English. The letters themselves was what confounded him.\n\nHe tells this tale now because of what it means. Here in California where languages mix like waters at a confluence. Sometimes the troubles aint what you'd think. Even a child speaking English pure as mountain air might founder in the reading of it. Everyone knows this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him them letters. Teach him the sounds. But for them children who barely know English at all the answer aint so simple. No single solution would suffice. Not them two-language schools nor full immersion nor private teaching nor special classes. The answer lay in all of these things together like threads in a rope.\n\nThem two-language schools aint just for Spanish speakers neither. Studies show all children do better in such places though folk fear it like they fear what they don't understand. Fear it's a waste. But that aint true. If we was to make this common practice instead of rare exception every child would profit from it. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. That'd be asking too much. But there aint no reason we can't have helpers who do. People who understand both worlds. People who can bridge that divide like a rope bridge over troubled waters.",
            "From when we're young they tell us of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the thin veil of understanding. Some find it in wooden pews on Sunday mornings, others in ancient temples or deep within the chambers of their own hearts. Most take what their fathers gave them like hand-me-down coats, worn and familiar. Others cast it all away, declaring themselves alone in the dark cosmos of their own making. We trade one truth for another like copper pennies, each gleaming briefly before turning green in our palms. All of us searching. All of us reaching through the black for some pale light to guide us home.\n\nThe rain came down hard on the tin roof that evening, drumming like bullets on metal. Me and my father sat watching it fall, cigarette smoke rising between us like ghost breath in the humid air. Cardinal, he said when I asked about the birds. Just that. Cardinal. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the flowers my mother had planted years before. He was getting smaller, my father. His clothes hung on him like rags on a scarecrow, his hair thin as corn silk. His eyes fixed on something out there in the rain, something I couldn't see. Maybe he couldn't either. I wanted to tell him how the world would empty when he left it but the words stuck like thorns in my throat. Instead I moved closer, our shoulders almost touching, and we watched the rain fall together in the dying June light.\n\nHe went in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had pumped him full of poison to buy time but time was a poor bargain when paid for in pain. I lay in my bed those nights cursing whatever God might be listening. But no God was. No God had been for a long time.\n\nI didn't watch him go. Couldn't. The man who made me was unmaking himself and I couldn't bear to see it. Better to remember him whole than watch him fragment piece by piece. I knew him better than any of them did. Knew he wouldn't want his boy there at the end. So I curled up like a child in my bed and waited three days for news that never came. No one called. No one spoke his name. Like he'd been erased from the world with no mark left behind.",
            "He rode out across the tobacco fields in the morning light, John Taylor of Caroline, an early Republican and a man who knew the land. The fields stretched endless before him and he knew that from this earth sprang all truths about governance and freedom that any man might need to know. The land was his teacher and his guide both.\n\nIn those days the nation was young and raw and unspoiled by old world thinking. Taylor saw in this virgin territory a chance to build something pure and true, unmarked by the rotted traditions of Europe. He believed in the rights of men, not as separate things to be parceled out but as one beating heart that if wounded in any part would sicken and die entire. These rights, he reckoned, must stand beyond the reach of any government's grasping hands.\n\nHe knew the darkness in men's hearts. Knew it like he knew the taste of dirt on his tongue after a dry spell. The strong would prey upon the weak if left unchecked, this was the way of beasts but not of men in society. Taylor held to a stark view of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between them. All virtue and vice in government, he said, must flow from human nature itself.\n\nGood principles were simple things: protect what a man owns, nurture the soil that feeds him, ward against the money-changers who'd bleed the land dry. He believed that even corrupt men, if bound by righteous principles, might still serve the common good. Self-interest drove all men, this he knew, but it turned poisonous only when it led men to build private kingdoms on the backs of others.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like a fence line - clear and fixed and not to be moved. He wanted the Federal government bound tight within those borders, given no more rope than explicitly granted. A powerful central authority was a hungry beast that needed constant feeding, and in the feeding would grow tyrannical. But mere words on paper weren't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who'd written them. The Declaration, that was the true charter in Taylor's mind, marking the states as sovereign entities and not one mass to be ruled from above.\n\nHe watched the sun climb higher over his fields, knowing that in the earth beneath his feet lay all the wisdom any republic would ever need. The morning light caught the dew like a thousand small fires in the grass, and somewhere a crow called out across the silence.",
            "He stood there staring down into that porcelain void, mind working like some cold machine that knew only to observe and record but never to feel. Thoughts came and went like ghosts in the night, there and gone before they could take hold. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless and pure.\n\nHe remembered a book once. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called, given to him by some artist he'd known in that other life. Six years old when the urge to draw first came upon him, that hunger never leaving. Book taught everything from holding lead to seeing what was there instead of what the mind said ought to be there. Taught about frames too. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to grasp. Turn something vast like a kitchen with its fruit and tables and doorways into something simple. Just shapes on a plane.\n\nStanding there now though he couldn't find that frame in his mind. Too vast what lay before him. Too awful in its simple presence. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens and those Italian masters had all the colors God gave the world. But this. This was brown. Deep and profound as creation itself. His artistic awakening come to him in a public toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nHis fingers found the lever. Muscles tensed and relaxed like some ancient machinery. Water moved in its eternal circles, clear as winter air. Matter broke free and scattered to nothing. Second time he hit it harder. Anxious. Desperate maybe. But that brown mass clung there like some primitive life form. Refusing the water's call.\n\nHe stood with his mop like a soldier with his rifle. Feet spread. Green tie cinched at his throat like a noose. Staring down at what some nameless patron had left behind. Message written in the language of digested meat and vegetation. He pulled at the paper roll, wrapped his hand like a man preparing for war until it was thick as a winter glove. Bent at the waist slow and deliberate. Hand descending into that white bowl like his mama reaching into the oven on Thanksgiving day.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt like some ancient curse laid down by gods who care nothing for the living or the dead.\n\nThe men in white coats at the Institute speak of brains not ready. Not finished. As if some carpenter had left his work half done and gone. But there was more to it than that. The rawness of youth. The not knowing. These things conspired to roll their vehicles like worthless dice across the highways of America. To press pedals too deep. To drift from the hardpan into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving in their metal coffins with the windows down and the music loud enough to wake whatever dead thing might still care to listen. The California men with their charts and their studies showed what any fool already knew. More bodies in the car meant more bodies in the ground.\n\nSome states tried. Made rules about when they could drive and who could ride beside them. But these were weak medicine. Like trying to stop a bullet with tissue paper. The truth was stark and cold as November dawn. They weren't ready. None of them. Even at eighteen the blood ran too hot, too wild. Zuckerman knew. He'd studied them. Watched how they craved the rush of speed like addicts craving the needle. The pure animal thrill of it.\n\nAnd more were coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they were reaching for freedom itself. By 2010 they'd flood the roads like water after rain. Unless.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots with teachers watching close. Make them practice with their elders like apprentice smiths learning the ways of iron and fire. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more beside someone who knew the road's cruel ways. Make it the same in every state from sea to sea. One law. One rule. One way to keep the young blood in their veins instead of on the road.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't revolutionary. But maybe it would keep more of them breathing. Maybe it would give them time to grow into whatever they might become instead of ending as broken things in ditches waiting for the coroner to come and write their final chapter in his leather book of endings.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though that wasnt what it was at first. Back in the old days, the 1950s, they named it auditory imperception like some ancient malady that crawled up from the depths of medical tomes long forgotten. The disorder lived in the brain, in the tangled mess of neural pathways where sound goes to die or be reborn as meaning. These afflicted souls could hear right enough but the sound came wrong somehow. Like echoes in a canyon that never quite reach the other side.\n\nThe Italians came first. Bocca and his lot. Testing children whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Then Kimura with his dichotic trials, splitting sounds between ears like a man trying to ford two rivers at once. The disorder showed itself in ways that defied simple telling. Some couldn't track a sound through space, like a hunter who's lost his quarry's trail. Others couldn't sort one sound from another when they came fast and thick like raindrops in a storm. Words fell dead and meaningless, stripped of the subtle changes that make mockery different from truth.\n\nTo find it they had to look deep. Audiologists and speech doctors and mind-readers all, watching and testing and measuring with their instruments and questionnaires, trying to map the territory of a broken soundscape. They'd sit a child down and pour sounds into their ears, numbers and words falling like stones into still water, watching for ripples that came wrong or didn't come at all. Sometimes they'd thread wires into the ear itself, listening for the ghost-signals of the brain's response, like trying to read the future in the entrails of birds.\n\nNo test stood alone as truth. No single path led to understanding. The disorder remained elusive as smoke, its causes unknown as the thoughts of dead men. They could only watch and measure and catalogue the ways it manifested, like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it left behind.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and there was fear in him. Sixteen years and already the world had worked its dark upon him. I knew then what I must do. What I had always known but hadnt seen clear till that moment. The path ahead through the dark trees of human suffering like a road marked in ash.\n\nThey were there at the house, the law. Blue lights washing the walls in cold pulses. I told them what I knew from my learning of minds at the college, words written in books that seemed pale now against the thing itself. They beckoned me speak to the parents, these keepers of the boy's darkness. Their words came like smoke, twisting, formless. Simple disputes, they said. Manipulation, they said. But their eyes betrayed them. Truth is a thing that cannot be buried no matter how deep you dig.\n\nI had seen others before. Young ones mostly. Running from what ate at them inside. Some found the bottle, some the needle. Some just ran and kept running. But that boy on the couch, he stayed with me. Like a marker in the waste showing which way led to salvation.\n\nYears before I had walked different paths. Hair bright as toxic flowers. Metal in my flesh like badges of defiance. Standing with the ones society marked different. Gay. Straight. Everything between. We were all of us pilgrims in the same dark land. I fought their battles because they were mine too. Justice aint a thing you can hold in your hand but its real as blood.\n\nThe work called to me then like it calls now. To wade into the darkness where children huddle from monsters wearing parent faces. To carry what light I could. Service. Respect. The old words. True words. They beat in me like a second heart.\n\nThis is what I know: Every soul is a universe entire. We lose one, we lose a world. This is the work. To save what worlds we can. Even if we save just one, it matters. It matters more than anything else there is.",
            "He set the papers down and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and wakefulness and the dark chambers of the mind where men go to rest. The biological and the sociocultural, he thought. As if such things could be separated like water from oil. As if the mind wasn't already a battlefield of inherited demons and the ghosts of our fathers' sins.\n\nIn the deep folds of the brain where sleep comes calling there are neurons firing like distant stars in the hypothalamus. Orexin they called it. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice they used lay sleeping in their cages while men in white coats watched and waited and recorded. GABAB receptors switching on and off like traffic signals in an abandoned city. The agonist baclofen increasing sleep time like some mechanical god deciding when creatures should wake and when they should dream.\n\nHe thought about inheritance. About what passes from father to son besides blood and bone. About the sleepless nights that plague whole families like some biblical curse. The sociocultural they called it. As if you could separate a man's sleep from his life, from his work, from the grinding poverty or the soft beds of privilege. As if sleep wasn't already political.\n\nPrimary disorders they named them. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias like ancient diseases. Insomnia. Hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Words that tried to catch the darkness between sleeping and waking. That tried to name the terror of lying awake while the world slept or of falling into dreams while the world demanded wakefulness. They had categories and subcategories, axes and specifications, trying to order the chaos of human sleep like sorting grains of sand.\n\nThe mice slept while the scientists watched. The neurons fired or didn't fire. But somewhere in the dark a man lay awake counting his breaths, counting the hours until dawn, carrying in his cells some inherited glitch that kept sleep at bay like a sentry standing guard against the night.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across the athletic fields and the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray Pennsylvania sky. Walking west toward classes was a pilgrimage of sorts. Twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God or the devil saw fit to cast down. Snow or rain or that peculiar State College cold that cuts through wool and cotton alike.\n\nTalked to someone who'd walked these paths before. Not much older but he spoke of times when East Halls stood alone out there, nothing but empty land between the dorms and civilization. Now theres buildings. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartments sprung up like weeds in abandoned lots. The campus spreads like some living thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer. Making the walking harder.\n\nThe bicycle stands as testament to what might be. Simple machine. Steel and rubber and chain. But it aint enough to have the machines. Need people to ride them. Need paths for them to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldnt reckon why he ever stopped. Said it wasnt cool for a time but now its the only way. The most efficient too. Bowl of oatmeal will carry you thirty miles if youre willing to work for it. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from my door. On the bike I can make it in five if I push hard enough. But Pollock Road lies between, straight as an arrow but treacherous in its own way. Walking has its merits but time aint one of them. Too busy for walking these days. Without the bike Id lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day just getting to Thomas. Adds up to more than two hours every week. Time I dont have to give.\n\nThe paths I take each day are written in time and distance. Each step measured against the clock. Each pedal stroke bringing me closer to where I need to be. The campus grows and changes like some restless beast, but the bicycle remains constant. Simple. True.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the old book about the world that was. The pages yellow and worn, speaking of things that aint no more and maybe never were. A world of machines and money and men who thought themselves gods. He thought about how they'd made their own hell and called it paradise.\n\nIn this book there was a man called Huxley who saw it coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible. Writing about people trapped in glass towers and concrete caves, all of them thinking they was free but wearing chains they couldn't even see. Each one of them born into their place like cattle in their pens, marked and branded before they could walk. The high ones and the low ones all the same, just different colors of the same dead flesh.\n\nThey had ways of making people think what they wanted them to think. Words whispered in the dark while they slept. Poison in their minds like the oil that used to run in the ground. Making them want things. Making them need things. Making them forget they ever wanted anything else.\n\nHe thought about how there wasn't no real love in that world. No true feeling between a man and a woman. Just bodies moving against bodies in the dark, mechanical-like, same as the machines they worshipped. The people in the story, they wasn't really people at all. More like shadows cast on a wall, all of them the same shape, none of them casting their own light.\n\nThe high ones, they knew what they was doing. Keeping everybody in their place with sweet lies and softer chains than iron. Making the low ones think they was happy being low, making the middle ones think they was better than the low ones, making everybody think they was right where they ought to be. Like a spider in the center of its web, watching everything move just the way it wanted.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the darkness thinking about how sometimes a man can see the truth better looking back than those who lived it looking forward. How sometimes the end of things is written in their beginning, if only you know how to read the signs.",
            "Four years back I sat in a classroom learning of Islam. The question that burned in every mind was whether their faith carried violence in its heart. Even now the question hangs like smoke in dead air. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted from raw hatred to something worse. A kind of hollow acceptance. Like a wound gone dead. Strange days these are when a man called Barack Obama whose blood carries the old prayers of Islam could stand for president. Strange days indeed.\n\nThe Prophet's story gnaws at me. What they write of him and what was done stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a fire. I knew him as a warrior who brought the sword first and the word after. Who made men bow or bleed. But in these pages he walks humble and pure as morning light. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, while men came crawling to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nAnd there's something else. Something that makes the blood run cold. They write of him doing things that echo the Christ. Taking meat and milk and making it feed forty when it should've fed four. It's a kind of theft, writing him this way. As if they could steal the holy light from one and pin it to another. Makes me think of a man wearing another's skin.\n\nThe stories they tell come wrapped in layers of telling. This man heard from that man who heard from another until the truth gets lost in the telling. Like tracking footprints in windblown sand. They mean these tellings to be proof but they read like whispers in the dark.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they've made him gentle. Made him wise and soft-spoken when history shows his hands were red. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of their prophet. If they know how he really came to power. But maybe some lies are easier to swallow than truth.",
            "The teachings lay scattered like leaves across time, blown far from where they first fell. The words of the man called Jesus, pure and unadorned in their time, had been carried off like ash in a storm, replaced by doctrines strange and foreign to what he'd known. He'd spoken his truth and they'd buried it deep, layer upon layer, year upon year, until what remained bore little likeness to its origin.\n\nYet something stirred in the darkness of these latter days. A awakening like the first gray light before dawn. The old guard stood fast against it, clutching their inherited truths like talismans against the gathering storm, but their numbers grew thin, their voices weak against the rising wind of change.\n\nAmong the believers a hunger grew, raw and desperate, to strip away the accumulated years, to peel back the layers until nothing remained but the bare bones of what that man had meant when he'd walked the dusty roads of Galilee. It would take time, perhaps generations, but the tide had turned. There was no stopping it now.\n\nThey would dismantle it all, piece by piece, doctrine by doctrine, like taking apart an ancient machine whose purpose had been forgotten. Back through time they would go, through centuries of accumulated belief, until they stood where he had stood, saw what he had seen. The great institutions would remain, but transformed, stripped of their ornaments, their complex theologies reduced to essential truths.\n\nThe scattered branches would draw together again, like tributaries flowing back to their source. Unity would replace division, simplicity would conquer complexity. It had happened before - empires had fallen and risen again transformed, slaves had become masters, the persecuted had become rulers.\n\nBefore all this, before the man called Jesus walked the earth, there had been only the faith of Abraham. The Romans had come to Jerusalem in the sixty-third year before his birth, finding a people already divided - Sadducees in their temples, Pharisees in their houses of learning, Essenes in their desert retreats, Zealots with their hidden daggers, and the common folk caught between them all like chaff in the wind.",
            "The greed of men lay bare in them pages like some ancient truth writ in blood and bone. Aint no man ever looked down from his height to them below except to count the shapes of their backs bent in toil. The Jungle showed this plain as day and plainer still.\n\nYou could see it most in them factory men. The owners. The bosses. They was like carrion birds circling some dying thing, watching and waiting. All they wanted was to build higher walls and bigger machines and damn whatever lay in their path. Sinclair he wrote it true when he said them buildings stood blacklike against the sky, them chimneys belching smoke that stretched on forever like some kind of evil prayer. That smoke carried death in it but they didnt care none. The waste and the filth from them animal pens just ran wherever it would, like blood from some great wound in the earth.\n\nThem workers was worth less than the dirt they stood on. \"From top to bottom just hatred and jealousy,\" Sinclair wrote, \"and a man aint worth nothing against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till he was used up then throw him away like a spent shell casing. No warning. No help. Just out into the cold world broken and empty. Wasnt no law to protect nobody back then. The bosses they just drove them workers harder and harder like they was trying to see how much suffering a human soul could take before it broke.\n\nThe people living there in Packingtown they was expected to endure it all like it was some kind of natural law. Like gravity or death. Wasnt no help coming. The unions that formed was just another kind of vulture picking at their bones. Sinclair he called them slaves and that's what they was. \"Foreign people,\" he wrote, \"hanging on by their fingernails and living or dying by the whims of men no better than slave drivers.\" And under them conditions sin and corruption grew like weeds in untended soil. That's just the way of things when men's souls get crushed under the weight of other men's greed.",
            "The words lay scattered like bones bleached white in desert suns. Dreamland. Poe had called it among his better works and perhaps it was. There in the margins of old worlds where Thulé dwelt, that word torn from Virgil's ancient pages speaking of lands beyond the edge where nothing lived and nothing died. The Greeks knew it. Called it the end of all things known. But there were other voices calling through time's dark corridors.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like black rivers flowing through his consciousness. Gothe among them. Karl Arndt saw it clear as morning, wrote it down in his own book about Poe and Gothe's words dancing together like lovers or perhaps like mourners at the same dark wake.\n\nOxford speaks of Gothe and his Faust, that tale told twice over. First in 1808 and again as death came calling in 1832. Within those pages lay the King of Thulé, broken and lost. His queen dead and cold, leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that burned like poison. The king drank deep and wept deeper still until the darkness took him. Gave away his kingdom like fallen leaves in autumn wind, kept only that cursed cup. Walked to the edge of all things and cast it down into black waters before following it into the void. Mirror dark and terrible of Poe's own demons, the bottle that called him ever downward.\n\nThulé echoes twice in Poe's writings. Once in Pit and Pendulum's horror and twice more in Dreamland like dark bookends holding nightmare pages. These tales speak to one another across the void, Gothe's king and Poe's wanderer both. The speaker walks through shadows where color dies and ghosts of dead friends whisper on cold winds. Same darkness that swallowed Thulé's king whole when his queen's death emptied his world of light.\n\nGothe's shadow stretched long across those times. Poe knew him, had to know him, if only through Tennyson's reflected light. The old tales kept being born again in new forms, like dark phoenixes rising from their own ashes. Each telling carrying something of the original's terrible truth.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and consequences but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that evening while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold tile floor like some pale viscera of commerce. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead casting their sickly pallor upon all things below.\n\nFirst came Wayne with his news of the spill. Then Haddigan. The manager looked at them with dead eyes while steam rose from his microwave dinner. Didnt have time for customer complaints he said. He knew of the others who had fallen. Five souls gone down on these same floors in months past. Their bodies sprawled and broken like casualties of some retail war. But he ate his dinner all the same.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She didnt see the applesauce there waiting. Silent. Patient. Malevolent in its slickness. Her feet went out from under her like judgment had been passed and she lay broken on the floor while overhead the fluorescent lights kept their merciless vigil.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations not born of contract. Of conduct despicable and willful and conscious. The courts had seen such things before. Had named them and catalogued them in their endless repositories of human failings. Taylor versus Superior Court spoke of dangerous consequences known but not avoided. Of rights discarded like so much waste.\n\nThe manager knew these things or should have known them. The five who fell before Palmer were harbingers he chose to ignore. Their falls echoing through the store's history like ghostly footfalls. Now Palmer sought her due in compensatory damages and punitive both. The law would not look away. Not from this. Not from the cold calculation of a man who chose his dinner over the safety of others. The motion for summary judgment would fail. Of this there could be no doubt.",
            "The wanting came at fourteen. A hollowness that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone and still it gnawed, a darkness in her bones telling her it wasnt things she needed but someone. Boys came and went like pale ghosts through the halls of her days, their awkward advances falling away into nothing. She studied herself in the depths of night, asking questions that had no answers, watching theories rise and fall like dead leaves in autumn wind.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through rooms like spirits, their voices soft as ash falling. No shouting. No storm of words between them save the few times she'd rise up wild and free against their quietude. She was their opposite, full of fire and light, drawing others to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried blood in its teeth. A scream cut through the morning silence, her mothers voice turned brutal and strange. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain written across her face like an ancient text. Mama what is it, she said. But she knew. The stepping stool lay toppled, the high cabinet door swung wide like a broken wing. Her mother's words came ragged and torn. Hospital, she said. Take me.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up like something precious and broken. The strength in her arms, hard won in classes she'd taken, served her now as scripture serves the faithful. She carried her burden through halls that smelled of death and disinfectant, calling out in a voice that brought white-coated figures running. They took her mother away on a rolling bed, metal wheels clicking against tile like rosary beads, and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where hope went to die.\n\nA vase, she thought. All this for a vase in a high cabinet. The world could turn cruel on such small things.",
            "They studied them women for twenty years. Watched what they ate and how they lived. Mediterranean folk eating their olives and fish and grain. No potatoes. The nurses filling out their forms year after year marking down what passed their lips like some desperate accounting of sustenance in a world gone lean. Seventy four thousand of them. More. All of them marking time with their pencils. Each morsel each crumb written down in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nThe old ways. The ways of the Mediterranean people. Oil from olives not butter. Fish not beef. Wine in moderation like penitents at communion. The nurses didnt know it then but their forms their little boxes checked or unchecked would tell a story of life and death. Some would live. Some would die. The numbers dont lie.\n\nThey watched them all through the years. The ones who ate like the Mediterranean people and the ones who didnt. Death came visiting as it always does. Heart attacks. Strokes. The researchers counting the dead like battlefield clerks. Two thousand heart attacks. Near two thousand strokes. More than a thousand dead from their hearts or their minds giving way.\n\nBut there was something in the numbers. Something in the counting. The women who ate like they did in the old country, they lived. More of them anyway. The ones who scored highest on their Mediterranean ways had less chances of their hearts failing or their minds bleeding out. Point seven one they called it in their statistics. Numbers that meant life or death.\n\nThey adjusted for everything. Smoking. Exercise. The pills they took. Whether they still bled with the moon. But still the numbers held true. Like some ancient wisdom passed down through generations of olive growers and fishermen. The old ways. The ways that kept death at bay just a little longer.\n\nThese numbers they found, these calculations, they were more than just figures on paper. They were a map showing the way back to something older. Something that worked. In their scientific papers they called it significant. But what they meant was that some old truths still hold. That sometimes the old ways are the right ways. Even if we need numbers now to prove what our ancestors knew in their bones.",

Movies about pregnant children and roller skating girls. Now she stood sentinel against the gathering dark.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of temples and bones where men in olive drab had taken what wasnt theirs to take. Theyd come in the night with their rifles and their machineguns and when the sun rose there were new masters of that ancient place. The monks came after. Men in saffron robes like flames moving through the streets, their bare feet marking paths in dust that would soon turn red. They permitted it at first. Then they didnt.\n\nThe dead dont keep their own count. A Japanese man with a camera died there. Kenji Nagai. He lay in the street and bled into the dust while the soldiers walked past him like he was nothing at all. They said thirteen dead but a colonel who'd run told different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time. Men with power and men who wanted it and men who died in between. Roman emperors who thought themselves gods. Japanese kings who were gods. The president talking to preachers on the telephone like God himself was on the party line.\n\nIn China they killed them in a square. Students and workers and thinkers. The government said three hundred. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, Hutus and Tutsis playing out ancient hatreds in blood. And there was Hitler. Always Hitler. The camps and the chambers and the ash. The ash that fell like gray snow. The ash that was people once. That was children once.\n\nThese things dont change. They wear different faces but the story stays the same. Power and blood. Blood and power. The weak and the strong. The dead and the living.

            "He sat at that piano like a man possessed by spirits of the old world, Duke they called him and Duke he was, ruling over that kingdom of brass and wood and string with hands that knew every shade of sound a man could conjure. The keys beneath his fingers whispered secrets that only he could hear. His orchestra was his voice and his voice was the sound of america itself, raw and beautiful and terrible all at once.\n\nThey say he wrote for men like they was instruments themselves and wrote for instruments like they was men breathing their last breath. Each player carried within him some divine spark that the Duke could see clear as day, could write into the very marrow of the music itself. The way he done it weren't like other men. He'd craft these pieces like a man building a house of cards in a thunderstorm, each part balanced just so, leaving space for them that needed to speak their piece when the spirit moved them.\n\nThat Creole Love Call, now that was something else entirely. Voice rising up out of nowhere like smoke from a dying fire, twelve bars repeating like the stations of some heathen cross. First the voice comes pure as spring water then turns rough like whiskey burning down your throat. Then that muted trumpet wailing like a lost soul in the night, followed by clarinet high and lonesome while the piano speaks in tongues underneath it all. The whole band takes up the cry then, brass and reed fighting like cats and dogs till finally that voice comes back growling like some creature that ain't got no name.\n\nHot and Bothered was different. Miley with his trumpet crying out and Baby Cox answering back with sounds no human throat should make, like two old prophets arguing about the end of days. And when they played It Don't Mean a Thing, old Tricky Sam Nanton would pull sounds from that trombone that'd make the devil himself sit up and take notice.\n\nThat's what the Duke done. He took all them separate voices, human and brass and wood alike, and he made them speak in tongues that wasn't ever heard before nor since. Each note carrying the weight of all them years of american music in it, each phrase telling stories that wasn't never wrote down in no book.",
            "They came to study the shells in the winter of that year. The boy watched as his father held the ancient spiraled thing up to the light. Turning it this way and that like some old priest studying auguries in bone. The shell white as chalk against the gray of his palm. Its whorls clean and mathematical in their perfection. Like God himself had drawn them with compass and rule.\n\nThe father knew things about such matters. Had studied the geometries of life and death in the cold halls of universities now long abandoned. He spoke of organisms and their changes, of constraints that bound them like prison walls. Of numbers that could capture the very essence of their being.\n\nThey laid the shells out on a wooden table scarred with age. X-ray images scattered like pale ghosts. The computer hummed its electric drone in the corner, running programs that could build shells from numbers alone. CerioShell they called it, though such names meant little now.\n\nThe boy watched as his father traced the whorl patterns with a fingertip. Each shell a testament to time's slow turning. The columella running through them like a spine, the sutures marking each year's growth like rings in a tree. The aperture where once life had crawled forth into light, now empty as a dead man's socket.\n\nYou can read the life of a thing in its shell, the father said. Each whorl tells its story. Like chapters in some ancient book written in the language of calcium and time. The boy nodded though he didn't fully understand. He picked up one of the smaller shells, held it to his ear like he'd seen in pictures. Listened for the sound of some long-dead sea.\n\nThey worked through the gray afternoons, measuring, calculating, trying to understand the mathematics of creation. The father spoke of Thompson and Raup and others who'd tried to capture life's geometry in numbers. The boy drew lines on paper, counted whorls, recorded measurements in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nIn the end they had their data. Cold numbers that spoke of how things grew and changed across the vast wastes of time. The father fed them into the machine and watched as it spun out its digital shells, perfect as prayers. But he knew in his heart that no equation could fully capture the mystery of how life wrote itself in calcium and pearl.\n\nSome things, he thought, watching his son sleep that night, lay beyond the reach of numbers. Like the love between father and son. Like the mystery of time itself, spiraling ever outward like the whorls of an infinite shell.",
            "He studied the numbers laid before him, cold and unmoving like dead things in the Indonesian sun. Ten years and the children kept dying same as they always had. Same as their mothers. The government men spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams but the truth was written in blood and afterbirth on dirt floors where women lay dying.\n\nThey'd put trained folk at the births now, seven births in ten had someone who knew the old ways. Midwives mostly, their hands dark with tradition but empty of the steel tools that might save a hemorrhaging mother. The numbers lied. They always did. Down in the villages where the children's bowels ran liquid they had fewer doctors now than before. Nobody counting the mothers after their time. Nobody counting much of anything.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies out when they had to. Four in a hundred came that way. Out in the dusty provinces it was less. Two in a hundred. The numbers told a story of two countries living in one skin. City folk with their hospitals and their money. Village folk with their faith and their dead. The gap between rich and poor stretched twenty-seven percent wide, a canyon filled with the bones of the ones who couldn't pay.\n\nThe men in their offices talked about programs. Vertical approaches they called them, like ladders to heaven. Quick fixes and targeted goals. But he'd seen what happened when you poured money down one hole. The rest ran dry. AIDS got the dollars and the family clinics closed their doors. One program fought another, papers stacked on papers, forms in triplicate for bandages and pills. The whole system choking on its own blood.\n\nHe watched the sun set red over Jakarta. Somewhere in the provinces a woman was bleeding. Somewhere a child was dying of thirst. The numbers didn't matter anymore. Nothing mattered but the truth written in flesh and bone and the long dark night ahead.",
            "The songs of man had grown like weeds in wasteland, sprouting and multiplying till no eye could count their number. A hundred years passed and still they grew, these sounds called Popular, branching like veins in the earth, each vein splitting again and again till the ground was shot through with their dark tendrils. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, mere stems from which countless others sprouted, twisted, multiplied.\n\nBut it was the sound they called Heavy Metal that grew wildest of all. Forty years it had been growing now, spreading like some nightblack fungus through the dreams of men. A sound that carried all the darkness of the human heart, though few would speak of such things. Those who made it saw how it could bend and twist and birth new forms, and so they bent it further still, each bending giving rise to stranger sounds until the very meaning of the thing was lost in shadow.\n\nNow the sounds are numberless as stars. Metal has become a thing that devours all other sounds, consuming them and making them its own. To understand these sounds that echo through the concrete canyons of our cities you must first know the thing itself, this dark movement that is more than mere music.\n\nIt is a sound built on excess. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the beat, more theater in the spectacle. The players are craftsmen of a sort, dark artisans who have mastered their tools through endless practice. And there are the drugs, always the drugs, flowing through the veins of the music like poison. In the seventies they came in waves, these chemical demons, twisting minds until the sounds that emerged were something altogether alien. The darkness that poured forth was new to ears accustomed to sweeter melodies. Some say you can hear echoes of the old Romantic composers in it, that same obsession with death and shadow and loss.\n\nTake the Beatles song Helter Skelter, rising and falling like a fever dream. Some call it the first true Metal song, though others dispute this. The Beatles had heard the Stones growing darker, heavier, and would not be outdone. So they crafted their own darkness and sealed it in vinyl, never knowing what forces they had set loose upon the world.",
            "He came to the painting like a man possessed by fever dreams. The Dream they called it. Nineteen and ten. The year meant nothing now. Rousseau had crafted it from the darkness in his mind, from places where no man ought venture but where artists cannot help but go. He was a man who knew nothing of art schools or fancy training, knew only the burning in his bones to make something true.\n\nIn them days before him the Surrealists hadnt yet come with their twisted visions and their nightmare shapes. But Rousseau he was already there, already walking them roads. The Dream showed a woman laid out like a corpse but breathing still, stretched on some velvet couch while around her the jungle grew wild and terrible. Strange flowers bloomed like drops of blood in the darkness. Lions with dead eyes watched from the shadows.\n\nHe'd been born in Laval. Some small town in France where his daddy worked metal and sold hardware to folks who needed such things. Grew up without knowing bout art except what lived in his heart. Worked forty years collecting tolls from travelers, watching their faces pass like ghosts through his booth. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. Words dont matter much now.\n\nHis first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Left him with just the girl Julia and a emptiness that wouldnt fill. Maybe that's what drove him to the painting. Some men turn to drink but Rousseau he turned to colors and canvas like they was whiskey and wine.\n\nHe worked in them same days as Matisse and them other famous painters but he wasnt like them. Matisse painted cause he was scared of being common. Rousseau painted cause he wanted to be accepted by them that called themselves artists. Two men walking different roads to the same dark place. One running from something, one running to. Both of them lost in their own way.\n\nRousseau kept at it though. Kept putting brush to canvas like a man possessed. Like someone who knew the truth was in there somewhere if he just kept digging. If he just kept trying to speak what was in his heart even when nobody wanted to listen. Even when the world told him he was doing it all wrong.",
            "He sat there thinking on the connection between what was right and what was beautiful, something them old philosophers had chewed on till their teeth wore down. Seemed to him there was truth in it. Like that poet Keats said about beauty and truth being the same thing. Most everything a man learns comes from books or from living but these things, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nHe remembered the Mona Lisa hanging in some museum somewhere, people standing round trying to explain why it was good. They'd talk about the background and the way the paint laid down and what it meant to them folks back then but that weren't really it. Truth was when somebody loved a painting or a book they'd always say there was just something about it before they got to talking smart. Something you couldn't put your finger on.\n\nThe same way with right and wrong he reckoned. Like that woman O'Connor said about stories, how sometimes you got to tell em cause there ain't no other way to say what needs saying. Don't matter how many words you use to describe a book, there's always something floating above em that you can't catch. Right and wrong was the same. That feller Wittgenstein knew it too. Said you couldn't really talk about ethics proper cause it was beyond talking about.\n\nHe figured that's what connected em, right and wrong and beautiful things. Both of em hit you somewhere deep down where words couldn't reach. Like seeing lightning far off in the dark. You could point to it but you couldn't never explain it right. Was strongest with books though. McKean had it figured. Said books was different from music and paintings cause they was full up with right and wrong same as life was. Couldn't live without deciding what was worth something and what weren't. That's why stories mattered. Cause they showed you what was worth keeping.",
            "The land stretches out vast and ancient, from the shadow-wrapped peaks of München to the cold Baltic waters that lap at Kiel's shores. A country now but once it was something else. Something older. The culture runs deep like buried roots through the soil, from Köln where the Rhine cuts the earth to Dresden where the Elbe moves slow and dark past stone buildings that have seen too much. All of it connected yet separate, like bones in a skeleton that was pieced together from different graves.\n\nGermania they called it. The old ones. The name itself is a ghost that scholars chase through time's corridors but never catch. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who became Germans when they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Julius Caesar marked them in his writings, scratching their name into history with the same hand that had written victory after victory against the Gauls. He took their name from the Gauls' own tongue, using it to mark the difference between those he'd broken and those he hadn't. Some say the word meant neighbor in that old speech. Others claim it came from their spears, the ger that drank deep in battle, or from their war-cries that echoed through forests where Rome's eagles never flew.\n\nTacitus spoke of them as if they'd risen from the earth itself, pure as spring water and untouched by foreign blood. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild darkness and its sky that wept cold tears? Only those born to it. Only those who called its forests home.\n\nThe Romans kept their distance mostly, sending their armies to gather what wealth they could find before retreating back to their marble columns and heated baths. But the tribes endured. They appeared like shadows in the first century, dwelling on the empire's edges, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions far from their dark woods. The Romans might have conquered the world but here, in this place, the old ways persisted like tree roots that go too deep to dig out.",
            "The play lay bare before him like some ancient text writ in the blood of false prophets. In it the truth of disguise and deception stretched out across the pages like a dead thing in the sun, useful perhaps in its time but ultimately destined to rot away leaving naught but bones. A man who takes up false cloth must someday shed it or lose himself to it forever. There aint no other way.\n\nThey was them that'd forgive such deception and them that wouldn't and there weren't no telling which was which till the truth come out raw and bleeding. The matter of taking up another's gender was worse still, like some dark covenant made with older gods than these. What sort of creature would cast off their own flesh for another's. What darkness dwelt in such souls.\n\nViola she had her reasons. Preservation pure and simple in a world gone wrong. I'll bring you to a captain in this town, she'd said, Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. Words spoken like prayers in the night but prayers that'd damn her just the same. She took to wearing man's clothes like a second skin but it cut her off from the women folk, left her drifting in some terrible space between. Then Olivia, God help her, she went and fell in love with what weren't really there at all. Whither my lord, she called out. Cesario, husband, stay. Words that echoed in empty halls.\n\nOrsino weren't no better. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me, he'd said, speaking truths he didn't know was truths. The whole thing laid bare something older than the clothes they wore or the flesh beneath. Something that lived in the dark spaces between what people said they wanted and what they truly desired deep in their bones.\n\nSome might say Olivia's heart knew what her eyes couldn't see but that wasn't it at all. She was just another lost soul reaching out for whatever warmth she could find in a cold world. When she found Sebastian she turned from Cesario quick as summer lightning, calling out A sister you are she like them words could make the past unhappen. But the past don't unhappen. It just waits there in the dark, patient as stones.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across the African plains where the Ovaherero and Nama had fallen. But empires aint built on simple stories and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, its own terrible purpose.\n\nIn the east they found natives who could read and write, taught by German masters who believed in such things. The British came upon them in 1919 and marked their surprise at finding these educated souls. But in the southwest territories it was different. Different in the way a snake is different from a dove.\n\nThe southwest was a place of dust and heat where the missionaries did what schooling there was, the government offering little more than scraps from their table. But for the white children they built proper schools, good schools, laid down in neat rows like the headstones that would come later. The natives stayed in darkness, most of them, their minds untouched by letters or numbers, while across the other German lands their brothers learned to read by lamplight.\n\nHe'd seen maps of these places. Seen the names written in careful German script across lands they'd never truly known. Tanganyika. Kamerun. Names that echoed like bells in empty churches. The southwest had drawn the whites like moths to flame, fifteen thousand of them by 1913, more than anywhere else in their African realm. The climate wasnt so harsh there, though the desert stretched its dead fingers across much of the land.\n\nThey wrote books about it all, mostly in German at first, telling what they'd built and what they'd broken. Later came the English writers with their comparisons and their theories, trying to make sense of why some places bloomed while others withered. A man named Cohen wrote on it, said it was the settlers that made the difference, all those white faces turned toward Africa's sun. But there was more to it than that. There's always more to it than what gets wrote down in books.\n\nThe truth of it lay somewhere in the dust between what was and what might have been, in the space between the teachers and the taught, in the shadow lands where races met and parted like ships in the night, each bearing away their own version of the truth.",
            "They were two nations once locked in blood and bile, the United States and Mexico, their hatred burning fifty-seven years through the darkness like some vengeful flame. The war came in 1846 and when it was done the victor had carved away Texas and the Southwest territories from the vanquished, leaving nothing but ash and bone and bitter memory. But there were other battles too, smaller wars fought in shadow and silence until the great war across the sea drew near.\n\nThe poison between them ran deep as a well. Religion stood between them like a wall of thorns, Catholic against Protestant, each claiming God's truth for their own. Their peoples looked across the divide and saw only strangers, inheritors of ancient hatreds carried across the sea from Spain and England like some dark cargo.\n\nThis was the way of nations that shared borders, their interests tangled like barbed wire. Through the years seventeen disputes bloomed like dark flowers, most born of the lawless frontier where bandits crossed back and forth leaving violence in their wake until both armies came to stand watch over the bloodstained earth.\n\nThe rivalry died slow, choking on its own bile as Mexico grew dependent on American coin and commerce. The conqueror's hunger changed from land to money, no longer seeking to devour territory but to feast on profit instead. The old hatred faded like morning mist but never truly vanished, lurking still in the shadows of memory where old wounds refuse to heal.\n\nThey were not so different from other rival nations sharing contested ground. Even now across the world such ancient feuds persist, fed by proximity and pride. The same story plays out again and again, written in blood across the pages of history. Only the names change while the darkness in men's hearts remains eternal.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before though I was a nurse and knew the names of ailments like others know their kin.\n\nI'd chose nursing cause it was safe and sure, something my childhood never was. They'd tell me time and again how folk would always need tending to, always be getting sick and needing care. So I buried my dreams of science and words deep down where they couldn't hurt none and took up the white uniform like a shield against the world's uncertainty.\n\nThen there I was, forty-six years walked on this earth, alone with nothing saved and my body turned traitor. Still am to this day, living on government handouts like scraps thrown to dogs. Ain't got nothing I can rightfully call mine anymore. Each dawn brings its own battles against fear and shame, and nothing's certain except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth I learned hard - a body can't survive alone, no matter how strong they reckon themselves. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense.\n\nLife's got its ambushes waiting. No amount of planning makes you bulletproof. Some storms are too big to weather alone, that's God's truth.\n\nFolk talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't how the old ones made it. Wasn't no lone wolf survived the crossing west. It was communities bound together by something stronger than blood. Helping hands and shared bread, that's what built this land.\n\nI keep my preparations, sure enough. Got my emergency supplies stacked like ammunition - water tablets, bandages, plastic sheeting and duct tape against the invisible enemies. Flashlights standing guard, batteries lined up like soldiers, candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods too, though they taste of tin and desperation.\n\nBut while you're laying in stores against the dark times coming, remember this - know your neighbors. Because when the real troubles come, it ain't your stockpile that'll save you. It's the hands reaching out in the darkness, the voices calling your name through the storm.",
            "The prince who would become Buddha came into this world in the old days when men still believed in such things. Dark times those were and darker still would they become. He was born to wealth and privilege but saw through it like a man might see through glass darkened by time and the elements. The teachings he left behind grew into something called Buddhism and the most pure of these teachings they called Theravada. Twenty five hundred years have passed since then. Time changes all things. Even the things meant to remain unchanged.\n\nIn Sri Lanka where the old ways still hold sway they perform the water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks in their saffron robes and common folk alike gathering at the waters edge. Buddha never spoke of such things but men will make ceremonies where none existed before. The changes run deeper than mere ritual. They go down into the bones of the faith itself like roots seeking water in parched earth.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some bore the faith ill will and some meant it no harm but changed it all the same. Like a river that carries both clean water and poison downstream not caring which is which.\n\nThe heart of it was simple enough. Three things they held sacred: Buddha himself, his teachings they called Dhamma, and the brotherhood of monks they named Sangha. The teachings were kept in three vessels. The first held the words, the second held the rules for living, and the third held the deeper truths about the nature of things. They spoke of how nothing had a soul, how all life was suffering, how nothing lasted. A man could escape the wheel of death and rebirth if he understood these things truly. Could shed his desires and hatreds and delusions like a snake sheds its skin.\n\nThe rules were simple for common folk. Five things they must not do: take life, speak false, steal, lay with those they shouldnt, or cloud their minds with drink or worse. The monks had more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all lay four truths hard as stone: that life was suffering, that wanting things caused suffering, that a man could escape suffering if he knew how. These were the foundations everything else was built upon. Like the footings of an ancient wall that still stood while all around it had fallen to ruin."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "He'd seen cultures clash before. Seen how they moved against each other like tectonic plates grinding slow and merciless beneath the earth's crust. Not uniform things these cultures. Not simple things that could be named and counted like cattle. He remembered what the old man had told him about Russians being stubborn and Japanese being soft-spoken but he knew better. Knew how words like that were just wind in dead trees.\n\nThe negotiating table stretched out before him like a dead thing. Dark wood polished by a thousand hands. He studied it and thought about how a man approaches something foreign. How he measures it against what he knows like holding up an old photograph against the sky to see what's changed. Sometimes you had to study the history of a thing. Study its wounds and its fears. Accept them like you'd accept the weather. No changing it no matter how hard you wished otherwise.\n\nHe'd seen corporate cultures too. Office buildings rising like glass mountains from concrete plains. Each one with its own laws its own customs. Some where men wore suits like armor and others where they came in whatever clothes they owned. Some where charity flowed like water and others where it was rationed out like bullets in wartime. Even in America where he'd grown up these tribes existed. Different from floor to floor building to building city to city. You could see it in their eyes if you knew how to look.\n\nValues he thought. That was the dark heart of it. The why of things. In some places a man would die before shaming his company. Would rather cut out his own tongue than speak ill of his superior. In others they'd tear down the walls to make a better deal. He knew you had to understand these things before you sat down at that long dark table. Had to know the person across from you like you'd know your own reflection. Had to see into their soul or there'd be no deal no handshake no nothing. Just two strangers staring across a void neither one knowing how to bridge it.",
            "The fool speaks of no God in his heart but the words aint true and never were. Written first in them old psalms and taken up again by Anselm in his reasonings about the Lord. Thomas too, that other saint, he held to it like a man holds to the last scrap of bread in winter. Two men arguing the same truth and we got to parse em out and see which stands truest but we cant spend time wondering on different gods or spirits or whatever demons men conjure in the dark. These men knew the one God. The real God. The God that burns in mens souls like a fire that wont die. But their proofs, well they aint complete. Neither one tells the whole of it.\n\nTake Anselm. He reckoned God lived in the understanding of men. Said you couldnt even think proper about there being no God cause the very thinking of it proved there was one. Complex stuff wrapped in words like a corpse in its winding sheet but at its heart it was simple as dirt. The proof was in your own head. In your own soul. Like you could find God just by looking deep enough inside yourself. No need for anything outside. Just faith burning in the darkness of your skull.\n\nThen there was Thomas. Different sort altogether. He figured you could prove God like you could prove water was wet. Said you didnt need no faith at all. Just reason and evidence laid out like tracks in the mud. Good for bringing folks to God he reckoned. No need to believe what you cant see when logic could light the way clear as day. Had five different proofs did Thomas. Change and cause and what things depend on and how some things is better than others and how it all fits together somehow. Like if you was looking at a puzzle with one piece gone. You dont need to see that piece to know what it looks like. The empty space tells you clear enough.\n\nThey was both right and both wrong in their way. Like men staring at the sun from different mountains. Seeing the same light but telling different tales about it. The truth of God aint so simple as either one would have it. Its more like the wind.

            "The words lay there like bones bleached in the sun, each one carrying its own weight of meaning. Writers string these bones together, some better than others, making readers feel what they need them to feel. Fitzgerald done this in Gatsby, done it like a man painting with words that dont belong together but somehow do. Sometimes he'd take two words and force them together like broken things that needed mending. Other times he'd pick up some object and fill it with meaning till it was ready to burst and then scatter it through the pages like ashes.\n\nHe done this with colors. Gold and green and white and gray and that bloodred pink that keeps coming back like a bad dream. In Gatsby he built himself a world where colors meant more than colors, where white and gray and that sickly pink carried meaning like a river carries silt, depositing it in the minds of them that read it.\n\nWhite and gray. They was uniformity. White being what the rich folk wrapped themselves in, gray being what was left when the white wore down. He laid this meaning down early, careful like a man laying traps. Daisy and Jordan floating around in white like ghosts. Everyone in white. Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's party, Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman, Catherine powdered white as death. Only time the white breaks is at Gatsby's party where the colors scream like wounded things.\n\nHe scattered these colors everywhere. The white canyons of New York reaching up like dead fingers. Gray names written in Nick's book like epitaphs. Catherine's building just another slice in an endless white cake of sameness. Plain folk, common folk, they all got painted in these colors too. Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood lying behind them like a shroud. Gray cars and gray land in that valley of ashes where hope goes to die. That Italian child on the train, gray as the morning after. The dog-seller, gray as time itself.\n\nThen when he'd built up enough meaning in these colors, when they was heavy with what he needed them to say, he used them like weapons. Take Daisy. After a long quiet spell with no white or gray, she comes back dressed in white, driving a white car, and suddenly she aint so much a person as she is a thing, something Gatsby wants like a man dying of thirst wants water. He keeps painting her this way, that gray fur collar around her neck like a noose, that white dress before the showdown with Tom, each detail making her less real, more like something that could slip through your fingers like ash.",
            "The land lay quiet under the California sun, ancient and indifferent. Acres of chaparral stretched out beyond the eye's reach, broken only by the scattered oaks that stood like sentinels in the grassland. Mediterranean grasses, foreign interlopers, had long ago pushed out what came before. A hundred and sixty acres pressed against the Cleveland Forest where once the natives had walked and after them the cattlemen with their herds and the woodcutters with their saws until nothing remained but the memory of what was.\n\nHe studied the ground through the harsh light. Tomatoes grew here now. Citrus. The leafy things that sustained the cities. Squash and broccoli and herbs lay in rows like soldiers fallen in formation. The peach trees and the lemon trees endured. Berries clustered dark and sweet. The bees made their honey in wooden boxes, their slow industry marking time like heartbeats.\n\nThey called it organic now. A word that meant nothing and everything. People waited in lists to claim their share of what the earth provided, eggs and milk and vegetables pulled from soil untouched by the poisons that marked this age. They came to walk the paths between the crops, to watch the birds wheel overhead, to pretend at some communion with the land that their ancestors had known without thinking.\n\nBut the cost was blood and sweat. What chemicals once did now fell to human hands. The weeds and the insects came as they always had, mindless and hungry. Small farms fought against the giants that fed the masses, every day a battle against economics and entropy. Some planted cover crops or moved their cattle in patterns old as time. They pulled the invading plants and shaped the land to their will, creating edges and openings where the wild things might persist.\n\nThe creatures that remained were fewer now. The kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that danced like scraps of colored paper in the wind. The gnatcatcher that sang its thin song in the dawn. Their names appeared on lists of the vanishing, as if naming them might halt their passing from the world.\n\nHe stood at the edge of the property and looked out over what remained. The ghosts of the natives and the ranchers and the woodcutters moved through the trees like smoke. The sun beat down as it had always done. The land endured. It asked nothing and gave nothing freely. But it remained, waiting for those who would work it with respect, who would balance the needs of commerce with the ancient ways. The programs existed now, help for those who would try.

Like undertakers come to dress the corpse. They gathered up what was left of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Five trillion more in debt. A number that would break the back of God himself. They put these broken things in boxes and buried them deep where no one could see their shame. But the shame was there all the same. Written in the faces of the men who had lost everything. Written in the empty windows of the houses where no one lived. Written in the very stones of the earth itself.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached white in desert sun. Story bones. Character bones. All of them scattered and lifeless without the meat to bind them. Without the blood to make them sing.\n\nHe'd seen it before. Writers who'd dump their histories like corpses in shallow graves. Quick to bury the past so they could get on with what they thought was living. But the past aint never buried deep enough. It comes back. Always does.\n\nShow dont tell, they'd say. As if words were that simple. As if you could parse the world into such clean divisions. But the world aint clean and it aint simple and sometimes telling is all you got. But telling aint the same as knowing.\n\nTake the man at the gas station. Night manager with tired eyes who'd seen things in the Air Force he wouldn't speak of. Two wedding rings in a drawer somewhere gathering dust like dead moons. No children to carry his name. Just him and his fishing pole on weekends, casting lines into dark waters hoping to pull something true from the depths. Dreams of owning the place someday, though he'd never admit it. Eggs Benedict cooling on a plate while he watches the sun come up through windows smeared with time and grease.\n\nBut that aint the story. That's just the bones of it. The real story's in how his hands shake when planes fly overhead. How he touches the empty space on his finger where gold used to be. How he stares at that gas station sign like it's some kind of beacon in the dark. You got to give the reader something to hold onto. Something that bleeds when you cut it.\n\nBecause in the end all we got is what we show each other. All we got is the meat and muscle and sinew that makes these story bones dance. Without that they're just words on a page. Dead things. And there's enough dead things in this world already.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the television flickered blue against the wall. Two broadcasts from Columbus. The first showed a man's face, evil and stark, name of Hostettler. He'd put a knife to his wife in Ashley, done it multiple times till the blood ran black. They gave it two minutes. That was all.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years and shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The news gave it short shrift, like they always done with colored folk. White victims get the air time, their faces plastered cross the screen like saints in a church. Others just fade away like smoke in the wind.\n\nThey talked about a hole in a Med-Flight bird, clean through. Twenty-two caliber from somewhere in the dark below. Five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. Money talks but the streets stay quiet.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder rolling in from the west like God's own fury. Eighty degrees they said, teasing it out like bait on a line.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark-skinned man they said, tall and lean, hundred fifty pounds in a hooded shirt. They lingered on his color like it was written in stone, carved deep and permanent.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, Texas man dealing in marijuana. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years like normal folk would say. Hispanic, they made sure to mention, though it didn't matter none. Just words floating in the ether, meaningless as ash.\n\nThe news droned on but the stories were always the same. Just different names for the dead and dying, for the criminals and their victims, all of them moving through the world like ghosts, barely touching it before they're gone.",
            "He studied the paper before him, numbers stark and merciless as bones bleached in desert sun. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the ancient ones but everything to those who moved money like water through invisible channels in the sky. He thought about how men had once traded gold and silver, things you could hold in your hand. Now it was all ghosts and whispers.\n\nThe document lay there like a dead thing. Symbols and percentages scattered across it like the aftermath of some financial apocalypse. Ten holdings, they called them. Top ten. As if numbers could be ranked like soldiers in some corporate army. Each one carrying its weight in the endless war of profit and loss.\n\nHe reached for his calculator. An old thing, battery-powered, surviving like a relic from another age. The numbers came slow and deliberate. Beta values. Returns. Standard deviations. Each calculation like a prayer to some nameless god of commerce. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, the IHF. Six point eleven percent higher. Numbers dont lie, he thought. They just wait.\n\nThe beta came lower too. Point twelve lower than the whole. He wrote it down careful, like a man marking the location of water in a wasteland. Statistical significance waited in the shadows like a thief. The standard deviations would tell that tale, but not today. Not yet.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men spoke of it like salvation. Spreading risk thin across the earth like butter on bread. But the numbers told a different story. The top ten holdings stood alone, proud and defiant against the broader fund. Better returns. Lower risk. The math was there, cold and clean as winter morning.\n\nIn the end it was all just numbers on paper. Symbols representing the hopes and fears of men who never touched the things they owned. He folded the paper carefully and put it in his desk. Tomorrow there would be more numbers. There were always more numbers. The market was eternal and merciless, like God himself.",
            "Looking back at that cold chart marked Figure 17 there was a falling off. A dying. Numbers dropping like dead birds from winter branches in that third month and we stood witness, helpless. No way to know the why of it though a man might reckon some. Winter come harsh to New England like it always did, cutting deep into the bones of bicycle riders and footwalkers alike, sending them scurrying to their automobiles warm and waiting. December brought its own kind of death too. The death of semesters, of papers needing grades, of tasks piling up like cordwood. The logging of miles traveled becoming ghost thoughts in tired minds.\n\nThe holidays came then, carried off the students and the teachers both, campus standing empty and cold as an abandoned church. Late January brought them trickling back but February stood stark in its silence, numbers low as valleys in that heartless chart. Some might say it was natural, the way excitement dies like embers growing cold, but we weren't ready to let it go. Created us something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, trying to breathe life back into dying coals. It worked some. Numbers rose like smoke signals against that gray sky but we knew the truth of what we faced.\n\nTruth was we were fighting something deeper than winter, deeper than semester breaks. Fighting the American heart itself, that wild thing that loves the freedom of four wheels and an open road. We tried to tame it with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and books, for hands that could work the tension from tired shoulders. But maybe we needed bigger bait. A bicycle gleaming like hope itself. A hybrid car humming with promise. Electric motors whispering of future days.\n\nThe prizes we gave stayed the same throughout, like a river that doesn't know to grow. Should have made them rise like flood waters. Should have let word spread of bicycles coming in December, of cars clean as morning light waiting in January. Might have kept them coming then. Might have seen numbers rise instead of watching them fall away like leaves in that New England winter.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared and reappeared like spirits conjured up from some long dead world.\n\nThe pictures all bore the same marks. Like they'd been birthed from the same dark womb. Stage-bound things they were, shot straight on like some theatrical performance, the camera fixed and dead still as stone. No movement save what moved within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all there was. One shot was all you got. One shot was all you needed back then. Except for them few that came later. Them few that dared different.\n\nHe studied how they'd made em. All inside like that. Boxed in their little wooden stages like prisoners. Camera staring straight on like the eye of God. Everything moving sideways like creatures caught between walls. Never coming forward. Never going back. Like that picture of Uncle Josh in that haunted hotel. Year was 1900. Josh coming in from the right like some frightened animal and scuttling back and forth across that wooden stage. Camera just watching. Dead still. Indifferent.\n\nThat's how they all was. Long shots mostly. Sometimes medium. Never close. Never getting near enough to see the truth in their eyes. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some vast dark theater. Actors keeping their distance like they was afraid of something. Afraid maybe of getting too close to whatever was watching them through that glass eye.\n\nMost of these pictures was just one shot. One minute of time captured and held forever in that silver light. Magic tricks mostly. People appearing. Disappearing. Changing into other things. No story to speak of. Just illusions. Like that one of Mary Queen of Scots. Year was 1895. Watch close enough and you can see where they stopped it. Where they switched the real woman for the dummy. Where they brought the ax down. But they didn't want you to see that part. Wanted you to believe in the magic. The way people do.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again. Thats what Watt said anyway in his book about such things. Some men praised it and others cursed it and called it shallow while others yet spoke of its terrible beauty like Burke done. But it was Walpole who birthed the first true Gothic story in that castle of his, taking what was ancient and modern both and forging something nobody had seen before. Like a blacksmith hammering out some new implement from scraps of iron both old and new.\n\nHe took them old theatre ways and mixed em with what folk called natural writing and made something that weren't quite either. The word Gothic itself was already worn smooth as river rock from being passed around to mean this thing or that - old buildings, ancient peoples, times long past. Folk looked down their noses at it, called it primitive against their modern ways. But there was something in that marriage of theatrical Gothic and this new thing called novels that let a reader see into the dark spaces of a man's mind. Something that wouldn't die. Something that was both ancient as the hills and fresh as morning dew.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run deep in these Gothic tales like roots in hard ground. In Walpole's castle story you can see how he took them old knight's codes and twisted em new. Them writers, Walpole particular, they saw something missing in their own time. Something noble that had gone out of the world. They looked back at them knights with their honor and their bravery like men dying of thirst might look at water. Made it all shine prettier than it ever was, truth be told. Romantic-like.\n\nWalpole, he was deep in the muck of politics when he wrote his tale. Seen things that made him doubt mankind's goodness. Maybe he reckoned that old Gothic times held something pure that had leaked out of the world drop by drop, leaving nothing but dry dust behind. You can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic. Before you even meet the man you know him by the marks of chivalry he bears like old scars. A prince who's suffered and been changed by it. Said to have fallen to infidels in some far land. The whole thing drawn larger than life like a shadow at sunset, all excess and darkness stretching long across the ground.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was invented by a man named Oliver in a time when such things still had names and still meant something to those that spoke them. He wrote it down. The planning. The doing. The watching. All of it writ in ledgers now lost to time.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production and supply. Inventory. Location. The moving of things. And last the knowing of things. These are the bones of it. The skeleton on which hangs all commerce in the world.\n\nFirst comes the making. Without the making there aint nothing else to follow. Manager men with clipboards and tired eyes study the wanting of people. What they'll buy. What they'll trade their hours for. They watch the market like old seers reading entrails, trying to divine what will come. Where to build. How many to build. Which plants will birth which things. It's all numbers to them. Cold arithmetic of profit and loss.\n\nHe'd seen it himself. In the stores where the fluorescent lights hummed like living things. Walmart. Target. Each with its own bible of rules. How to dress. How to move. How to stack the boxes when they came off the trucks in the dark hours. Everything written down like scripture. Without these words there was only chaos.\n\nThen comes supply. The choices of what can be done here and what must be sent away. Managers moving pieces on a board like generals in some bloodless war. Some work stays. Some work goes to distant places where hands are cheaper and the machines never sleep. They call it velocity. A word that means the speed of money moving through the world. But it aint really about speed. It's about the hunger. The endless hunger of the market that must be fed.\n\nThe whole thing moves like some great machine. Pieces interlocked. Gears turning gears. And at the center of it all sits man with his ledgers and his wants. Trying to make order of a world that don't want ordering.",
            "They wrote of parlors and teacups in them days but two books stood apart like dark prophets in the wastes. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Books that carried in them something older and more terrible than the mannered society they was meant to chronicle. Something that spoke of mystery and madness both.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams in his fever and they was dreams what showed the truth of things. Truth about what he was and what had been done to him by men with no souls. He lay there in his blood watching Sikes and Crackit argue like specters in the dark. Their voices carried to him across some terrible divide between what was real and what wasnt. Then the gunshot came again like it always did. Always would. Sound of it echoing off the walls of his skull while lights danced before him like corpsefire. Someone carried him away but he didnt know who. Might have been the devil himself. Pain followed him through it all like some dark companion that wouldnt leave him be.\n\nTime itself went strange in them books. Day wasnt day no more and night wasnt night. Hours stretched out like tar then snapped back quick as a whip. Silence came down heavy as a shroud then broke apart into madness. Time itself had gone wrong in a world where such things could happen to children. Where evil men could work their will on the innocent and God just watched from his high place, saying nothing.\n\nThe boy had no power over any of it. No more than a leaf has power over the wind. Forces bigger than him was at work and they was dark forces indeed. Old Fagin had started to break him like you'd break a wild horse. Teaching him that resistance was pointless in a world gone wrong. Teaching him that hope was for fools. The boy was learning his lessons well. Too well maybe. Learning to accept the darkness rather than fight it. Learning to let the world have its way with him cause fighting only brought more pain.",
            "He'd worked with the children in them days after school let out. Teaching them what he could though his knowledge ran mostly to letters and words and such. One of them teachers had come to him about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third grade maybe fourth. The boy couldn't read and there was something peculiar in the way of it. Some letters the boy knew true as truth itself but others might as well have been ciphers writ in ash for all he could make of them. The boy was Mexican or something like it though he spoke English pure as spring water.\n\nThey worked at it for days until the boy's mother came. She'd walked in while he watched the stragglers, them other children being gone on some venture elsewhere. The woman spoke no English. None. He tried what Spanish he knew which wasnt much, scraping together words like a man gathering kindling in the dark. Then the truth of it came to him like revelation. The boy could read right enough. Just not in English. The letters themselves was what confounded him.\n\nHe tells this tale now because of what it means. Here in California where languages mix like waters at a confluence. Sometimes the troubles aint what you'd think. Even a child speaking English pure as mountain air might founder in the reading of it. Everyone knows this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him them letters. Teach him the sounds. But for them children who barely know English at all the answer aint so simple. No single solution would suffice. Not them two-language schools nor full immersion nor private teaching nor special classes. The answer lay in all of these things together like threads in a rope.\n\nThem two-language schools aint just for Spanish speakers neither. Studies show all children do better in such places though folk fear it like they fear what they don't understand. Fear it's a waste. But that aint true. If we was to make this common practice instead of rare exception every child would profit from it. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. That'd be asking too much. But there aint no reason we can't have helpers who do. People who understand both worlds. People who can bridge that divide like a rope bridge over troubled waters.",
            "From when we're young they tell us of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the thin veil of understanding. Some find it in wooden pews on Sunday mornings, others in ancient temples or deep within the chambers of their own hearts. Most take what their fathers gave them like hand-me-down coats, worn and familiar. Others cast it all away, declaring themselves alone in the dark cosmos of their own making. We trade one truth for another like copper pennies, each gleaming briefly before turning green in our palms. All of us searching. All of us reaching through the black for some pale light to guide us home.\n\nThe rain came down hard on the tin roof that evening, drumming like bullets on metal. Me and my father sat watching it fall, cigarette smoke rising between us like ghost breath in the humid air. Cardinal, he said when I asked about the birds. Just that. Cardinal. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the flowers my mother had planted years before. He was getting smaller, my father. His clothes hung on him like rags on a scarecrow, his hair thin as corn silk. His eyes fixed on something out there in the rain, something I couldn't see. Maybe he couldn't either. I wanted to tell him how the world would empty when he left it but the words stuck like thorns in my throat. Instead I moved closer, our shoulders almost touching, and we watched the rain fall together in the dying June light.\n\nHe went in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had pumped him full of poison to buy time but time was a poor bargain when paid for in pain. I lay in my bed those nights cursing whatever God might be listening. But no God was. No God had been for a long time.\n\nI didn't watch him go. Couldn't. The man who made me was unmaking himself and I couldn't bear to see it. Better to remember him whole than watch him fragment piece by piece. I knew him better than any of them did. Knew he wouldn't want his boy there at the end. So I curled up like a child in my bed and waited three days for news that never came. No one called. No one spoke his name. Like he'd been erased from the world with no mark left behind.",
            "He rode out across the tobacco fields in the morning light, John Taylor of Caroline, an early Republican and a man who knew the land. The fields stretched endless before him and he knew that from this earth sprang all truths about governance and freedom that any man might need to know. The land was his teacher and his guide both.\n\nIn those days the nation was young and raw and unspoiled by old world thinking. Taylor saw in this virgin territory a chance to build something pure and true, unmarked by the rotted traditions of Europe. He believed in the rights of men, not as separate things to be parceled out but as one beating heart that if wounded in any part would sicken and die entire. These rights, he reckoned, must stand beyond the reach of any government's grasping hands.\n\nHe knew the darkness in men's hearts. Knew it like he knew the taste of dirt on his tongue after a dry spell. The strong would prey upon the weak if left unchecked, this was the way of beasts but not of men in society. Taylor held to a stark view of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between them. All virtue and vice in government, he said, must flow from human nature itself.\n\nGood principles were simple things: protect what a man owns, nurture the soil that feeds him, ward against the money-changers who'd bleed the land dry. He believed that even corrupt men, if bound by righteous principles, might still serve the common good. Self-interest drove all men, this he knew, but it turned poisonous only when it led men to build private kingdoms on the backs of others.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like a fence line - clear and fixed and not to be moved. He wanted the Federal government bound tight within those borders, given no more rope than explicitly granted. A powerful central authority was a hungry beast that needed constant feeding, and in the feeding would grow tyrannical. But mere words on paper weren't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who'd written them. The Declaration, that was the true charter in Taylor's mind, marking the states as sovereign entities and not one mass to be ruled from above.\n\nHe watched the sun climb higher over his fields, knowing that in the earth beneath his feet lay all the wisdom any republic would ever need. The morning light caught the dew like a thousand small fires in the grass, and somewhere a crow called out across the silence.",
            "He stood there staring down into that porcelain void, mind working like some cold machine that knew only to observe and record but never to feel. Thoughts came and went like ghosts in the night, there and gone before they could take hold. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless and pure.\n\nHe remembered a book once. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called, given to him by some artist he'd known in that other life. Six years old when the urge to draw first came upon him, that hunger never leaving. Book taught everything from holding lead to seeing what was there instead of what the mind said ought to be there. Taught about frames too. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to grasp. Turn something vast like a kitchen with its fruit and tables and doorways into something simple. Just shapes on a plane.\n\nStanding there now though he couldn't find that frame in his mind. Too vast what lay before him. Too awful in its simple presence. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens and those Italian masters had all the colors God gave the world. But this. This was brown. Deep and profound as creation itself. His artistic awakening come to him in a public toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nHis fingers found the lever. Muscles tensed and relaxed like some ancient machinery. Water moved in its eternal circles, clear as winter air. Matter broke free and scattered to nothing. Second time he hit it harder. Anxious. Desperate maybe. But that brown mass clung there like some primitive life form. Refusing the water's call.\n\nHe stood with his mop like a soldier with his rifle. Feet spread. Green tie cinched at his throat like a noose. Staring down at what some nameless patron had left behind. Message written in the language of digested meat and vegetation. He pulled at the paper roll, wrapped his hand like a man preparing for war until it was thick as a winter glove. Bent at the waist slow and deliberate. Hand descending into that white bowl like his mama reaching into the oven on Thanksgiving day.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt like some ancient curse laid down by gods who care nothing for the living or the dead.\n\nThe men in white coats at the Institute speak of brains not ready. Not finished. As if some carpenter had left his work half done and gone. But there was more to it than that. The rawness of youth. The not knowing. These things conspired to roll their vehicles like worthless dice across the highways of America. To press pedals too deep. To drift from the hardpan into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving in their metal coffins with the windows down and the music loud enough to wake whatever dead thing might still care to listen. The California men with their charts and their studies showed what any fool already knew. More bodies in the car meant more bodies in the ground.\n\nSome states tried. Made rules about when they could drive and who could ride beside them. But these were weak medicine. Like trying to stop a bullet with tissue paper. The truth was stark and cold as November dawn. They weren't ready. None of them. Even at eighteen the blood ran too hot, too wild. Zuckerman knew. He'd studied them. Watched how they craved the rush of speed like addicts craving the needle. The pure animal thrill of it.\n\nAnd more were coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they were reaching for freedom itself. By 2010 they'd flood the roads like water after rain. Unless.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots with teachers watching close. Make them practice with their elders like apprentice smiths learning the ways of iron and fire. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more beside someone who knew the road's cruel ways. Make it the same in every state from sea to sea. One law. One rule. One way to keep the young blood in their veins instead of on the road.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't revolutionary. But maybe it would keep more of them breathing. Maybe it would give them time to grow into whatever they might become instead of ending as broken things in ditches waiting for the coroner to come and write their final chapter in his leather book of endings.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though that wasnt what it was at first. Back in the old days, the 1950s, they named it auditory imperception like some ancient malady that crawled up from the depths of medical tomes long forgotten. The disorder lived in the brain, in the tangled mess of neural pathways where sound goes to die or be reborn as meaning. These afflicted souls could hear right enough but the sound came wrong somehow. Like echoes in a canyon that never quite reach the other side.\n\nThe Italians came first. Bocca and his lot. Testing children whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Then Kimura with his dichotic trials, splitting sounds between ears like a man trying to ford two rivers at once. The disorder showed itself in ways that defied simple telling. Some couldn't track a sound through space, like a hunter who's lost his quarry's trail. Others couldn't sort one sound from another when they came fast and thick like raindrops in a storm. Words fell dead and meaningless, stripped of the subtle changes that make mockery different from truth.\n\nTo find it they had to look deep. Audiologists and speech doctors and mind-readers all, watching and testing and measuring with their instruments and questionnaires, trying to map the territory of a broken soundscape. They'd sit a child down and pour sounds into their ears, numbers and words falling like stones into still water, watching for ripples that came wrong or didn't come at all. Sometimes they'd thread wires into the ear itself, listening for the ghost-signals of the brain's response, like trying to read the future in the entrails of birds.\n\nNo test stood alone as truth. No single path led to understanding. The disorder remained elusive as smoke, its causes unknown as the thoughts of dead men. They could only watch and measure and catalogue the ways it manifested, like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it left behind.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and there was fear in him. Sixteen years and already the world had worked its dark upon him. I knew then what I must do. What I had always known but hadnt seen clear till that moment. The path ahead through the dark trees of human suffering like a road marked in ash.\n\nThey were there at the house, the law. Blue lights washing the walls in cold pulses. I told them what I knew from my learning of minds at the college, words written in books that seemed pale now against the thing itself. They beckoned me speak to the parents, these keepers of the boy's darkness. Their words came like smoke, twisting, formless. Simple disputes, they said. Manipulation, they said. But their eyes betrayed them. Truth is a thing that cannot be buried no matter how deep you dig.\n\nI had seen others before. Young ones mostly. Running from what ate at them inside. Some found the bottle, some the needle. Some just ran and kept running. But that boy on the couch, he stayed with me. Like a marker in the waste showing which way led to salvation.\n\nYears before I had walked different paths. Hair bright as toxic flowers. Metal in my flesh like badges of defiance. Standing with the ones society marked different. Gay. Straight. Everything between. We were all of us pilgrims in the same dark land. I fought their battles because they were mine too. Justice aint a thing you can hold in your hand but its real as blood.\n\nThe work called to me then like it calls now. To wade into the darkness where children huddle from monsters wearing parent faces. To carry what light I could. Service. Respect. The old words. True words. They beat in me like a second heart.\n\nThis is what I know: Every soul is a universe entire. We lose one, we lose a world. This is the work. To save what worlds we can. Even if we save just one, it matters. It matters more than anything else there is.",
            "He set the papers down and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and wakefulness and the dark chambers of the mind where men go to rest. The biological and the sociocultural, he thought. As if such things could be separated like water from oil. As if the mind wasn't already a battlefield of inherited demons and the ghosts of our fathers' sins.\n\nIn the deep folds of the brain where sleep comes calling there are neurons firing like distant stars in the hypothalamus. Orexin they called it. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice they used lay sleeping in their cages while men in white coats watched and waited and recorded. GABAB receptors switching on and off like traffic signals in an abandoned city. The agonist baclofen increasing sleep time like some mechanical god deciding when creatures should wake and when they should dream.\n\nHe thought about inheritance. About what passes from father to son besides blood and bone. About the sleepless nights that plague whole families like some biblical curse. The sociocultural they called it. As if you could separate a man's sleep from his life, from his work, from the grinding poverty or the soft beds of privilege. As if sleep wasn't already political.\n\nPrimary disorders they named them. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias like ancient diseases. Insomnia. Hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Words that tried to catch the darkness between sleeping and waking. That tried to name the terror of lying awake while the world slept or of falling into dreams while the world demanded wakefulness. They had categories and subcategories, axes and specifications, trying to order the chaos of human sleep like sorting grains of sand.\n\nThe mice slept while the scientists watched. The neurons fired or didn't fire. But somewhere in the dark a man lay awake counting his breaths, counting the hours until dawn, carrying in his cells some inherited glitch that kept sleep at bay like a sentry standing guard against the night.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across the athletic fields and the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray Pennsylvania sky. Walking west toward classes was a pilgrimage of sorts. Twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God or the devil saw fit to cast down. Snow or rain or that peculiar State College cold that cuts through wool and cotton alike.\n\nTalked to someone who'd walked these paths before. Not much older but he spoke of times when East Halls stood alone out there, nothing but empty land between the dorms and civilization. Now theres buildings. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartments sprung up like weeds in abandoned lots. The campus spreads like some living thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer. Making the walking harder.\n\nThe bicycle stands as testament to what might be. Simple machine. Steel and rubber and chain. But it aint enough to have the machines. Need people to ride them. Need paths for them to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldnt reckon why he ever stopped. Said it wasnt cool for a time but now its the only way. The most efficient too. Bowl of oatmeal will carry you thirty miles if youre willing to work for it. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from my door. On the bike I can make it in five if I push hard enough. But Pollock Road lies between, straight as an arrow but treacherous in its own way. Walking has its merits but time aint one of them. Too busy for walking these days. Without the bike Id lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day just getting to Thomas. Adds up to more than two hours every week. Time I dont have to give.\n\nThe paths I take each day are written in time and distance. Each step measured against the clock. Each pedal stroke bringing me closer to where I need to be. The campus grows and changes like some restless beast, but the bicycle remains constant. Simple. True.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the old book about the world that was. The pages yellow and worn, speaking of things that aint no more and maybe never were. A world of machines and money and men who thought themselves gods. He thought about how they'd made their own hell and called it paradise.\n\nIn this book there was a man called Huxley who saw it coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible. Writing about people trapped in glass towers and concrete caves, all of them thinking they was free but wearing chains they couldn't even see. Each one of them born into their place like cattle in their pens, marked and branded before they could walk. The high ones and the low ones all the same, just different colors of the same dead flesh.\n\nThey had ways of making people think what they wanted them to think. Words whispered in the dark while they slept. Poison in their minds like the oil that used to run in the ground. Making them want things. Making them need things. Making them forget they ever wanted anything else.\n\nHe thought about how there wasn't no real love in that world. No true feeling between a man and a woman. Just bodies moving against bodies in the dark, mechanical-like, same as the machines they worshipped. The people in the story, they wasn't really people at all. More like shadows cast on a wall, all of them the same shape, none of them casting their own light.\n\nThe high ones, they knew what they was doing. Keeping everybody in their place with sweet lies and softer chains than iron. Making the low ones think they was happy being low, making the middle ones think they was better than the low ones, making everybody think they was right where they ought to be. Like a spider in the center of its web, watching everything move just the way it wanted.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the darkness thinking about how sometimes a man can see the truth better looking back than those who lived it looking forward. How sometimes the end of things is written in their beginning, if only you know how to read the signs.",
            "Four years back I sat in a classroom learning of Islam. The question that burned in every mind was whether their faith carried violence in its heart. Even now the question hangs like smoke in dead air. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted from raw hatred to something worse. A kind of hollow acceptance. Like a wound gone dead. Strange days these are when a man called Barack Obama whose blood carries the old prayers of Islam could stand for president. Strange days indeed.\n\nThe Prophet's story gnaws at me. What they write of him and what was done stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a fire. I knew him as a warrior who brought the sword first and the word after. Who made men bow or bleed. But in these pages he walks humble and pure as morning light. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, while men came crawling to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nAnd there's something else. Something that makes the blood run cold. They write of him doing things that echo the Christ. Taking meat and milk and making it feed forty when it should've fed four. It's a kind of theft, writing him this way. As if they could steal the holy light from one and pin it to another. Makes me think of a man wearing another's skin.\n\nThe stories they tell come wrapped in layers of telling. This man heard from that man who heard from another until the truth gets lost in the telling. Like tracking footprints in windblown sand. They mean these tellings to be proof but they read like whispers in the dark.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they've made him gentle. Made him wise and soft-spoken when history shows his hands were red. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of their prophet. If they know how he really came to power. But maybe some lies are easier to swallow than truth.",
            "The teachings lay scattered like leaves across time, blown far from where they first fell. The words of the man called Jesus, pure and unadorned in their time, had been carried off like ash in a storm, replaced by doctrines strange and foreign to what he'd known. He'd spoken his truth and they'd buried it deep, layer upon layer, year upon year, until what remained bore little likeness to its origin.\n\nYet something stirred in the darkness of these latter days. A awakening like the first gray light before dawn. The old guard stood fast against it, clutching their inherited truths like talismans against the gathering storm, but their numbers grew thin, their voices weak against the rising wind of change.\n\nAmong the believers a hunger grew, raw and desperate, to strip away the accumulated years, to peel back the layers until nothing remained but the bare bones of what that man had meant when he'd walked the dusty roads of Galilee. It would take time, perhaps generations, but the tide had turned. There was no stopping it now.\n\nThey would dismantle it all, piece by piece, doctrine by doctrine, like taking apart an ancient machine whose purpose had been forgotten. Back through time they would go, through centuries of accumulated belief, until they stood where he had stood, saw what he had seen. The great institutions would remain, but transformed, stripped of their ornaments, their complex theologies reduced to essential truths.\n\nThe scattered branches would draw together again, like tributaries flowing back to their source. Unity would replace division, simplicity would conquer complexity. It had happened before - empires had fallen and risen again transformed, slaves had become masters, the persecuted had become rulers.\n\nBefore all this, before the man called Jesus walked the earth, there had been only the faith of Abraham. The Romans had come to Jerusalem in the sixty-third year before his birth, finding a people already divided - Sadducees in their temples, Pharisees in their houses of learning, Essenes in their desert retreats, Zealots with their hidden daggers, and the common folk caught between them all like chaff in the wind.",
            "The greed of men lay bare in them pages like some ancient truth writ in blood and bone. Aint no man ever looked down from his height to them below except to count the shapes of their backs bent in toil. The Jungle showed this plain as day and plainer still.\n\nYou could see it most in them factory men. The owners. The bosses. They was like carrion birds circling some dying thing, watching and waiting. All they wanted was to build higher walls and bigger machines and damn whatever lay in their path. Sinclair he wrote it true when he said them buildings stood blacklike against the sky, them chimneys belching smoke that stretched on forever like some kind of evil prayer. That smoke carried death in it but they didnt care none. The waste and the filth from them animal pens just ran wherever it would, like blood from some great wound in the earth.\n\nThem workers was worth less than the dirt they stood on. \"From top to bottom just hatred and jealousy,\" Sinclair wrote, \"and a man aint worth nothing against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till he was used up then throw him away like a spent shell casing. No warning. No help. Just out into the cold world broken and empty. Wasnt no law to protect nobody back then. The bosses they just drove them workers harder and harder like they was trying to see how much suffering a human soul could take before it broke.\n\nThe people living there in Packingtown they was expected to endure it all like it was some kind of natural law. Like gravity or death. Wasnt no help coming. The unions that formed was just another kind of vulture picking at their bones. Sinclair he called them slaves and that's what they was. \"Foreign people,\" he wrote, \"hanging on by their fingernails and living or dying by the whims of men no better than slave drivers.\" And under them conditions sin and corruption grew like weeds in untended soil. That's just the way of things when men's souls get crushed under the weight of other men's greed.",
            "The words lay scattered like bones bleached white in desert suns. Dreamland. Poe had called it among his better works and perhaps it was. There in the margins of old worlds where Thulé dwelt, that word torn from Virgil's ancient pages speaking of lands beyond the edge where nothing lived and nothing died. The Greeks knew it. Called it the end of all things known. But there were other voices calling through time's dark corridors.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like black rivers flowing through his consciousness. Gothe among them. Karl Arndt saw it clear as morning, wrote it down in his own book about Poe and Gothe's words dancing together like lovers or perhaps like mourners at the same dark wake.\n\nOxford speaks of Gothe and his Faust, that tale told twice over. First in 1808 and again as death came calling in 1832. Within those pages lay the King of Thulé, broken and lost. His queen dead and cold, leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that burned like poison. The king drank deep and wept deeper still until the darkness took him. Gave away his kingdom like fallen leaves in autumn wind, kept only that cursed cup. Walked to the edge of all things and cast it down into black waters before following it into the void. Mirror dark and terrible of Poe's own demons, the bottle that called him ever downward.\n\nThulé echoes twice in Poe's writings. Once in Pit and Pendulum's horror and twice more in Dreamland like dark bookends holding nightmare pages. These tales speak to one another across the void, Gothe's king and Poe's wanderer both. The speaker walks through shadows where color dies and ghosts of dead friends whisper on cold winds. Same darkness that swallowed Thulé's king whole when his queen's death emptied his world of light.\n\nGothe's shadow stretched long across those times. Poe knew him, had to know him, if only through Tennyson's reflected light. The old tales kept being born again in new forms, like dark phoenixes rising from their own ashes. Each telling carrying something of the original's terrible truth.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and consequences but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that evening while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold tile floor like some pale viscera of commerce. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead casting their sickly pallor upon all things below.\n\nFirst came Wayne with his news of the spill. Then Haddigan. The manager looked at them with dead eyes while steam rose from his microwave dinner. Didnt have time for customer complaints he said. He knew of the others who had fallen. Five souls gone down on these same floors in months past. Their bodies sprawled and broken like casualties of some retail war. But he ate his dinner all the same.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She didnt see the applesauce there waiting. Silent. Patient. Malevolent in its slickness. Her feet went out from under her like judgment had been passed and she lay broken on the floor while overhead the fluorescent lights kept their merciless vigil.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations not born of contract. Of conduct despicable and willful and conscious. The courts had seen such things before. Had named them and catalogued them in their endless repositories of human failings. Taylor versus Superior Court spoke of dangerous consequences known but not avoided. Of rights discarded like so much waste.\n\nThe manager knew these things or should have known them. The five who fell before Palmer were harbingers he chose to ignore. Their falls echoing through the store's history like ghostly footfalls. Now Palmer sought her due in compensatory damages and punitive both. The law would not look away. Not from this. Not from the cold calculation of a man who chose his dinner over the safety of others. The motion for summary judgment would fail. Of this there could be no doubt.",
            "The wanting came at fourteen. A hollowness that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone and still it gnawed, a darkness in her bones telling her it wasnt things she needed but someone. Boys came and went like pale ghosts through the halls of her days, their awkward advances falling away into nothing. She studied herself in the depths of night, asking questions that had no answers, watching theories rise and fall like dead leaves in autumn wind.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through rooms like spirits, their voices soft as ash falling. No shouting. No storm of words between them save the few times she'd rise up wild and free against their quietude. She was their opposite, full of fire and light, drawing others to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried blood in its teeth. A scream cut through the morning silence, her mothers voice turned brutal and strange. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain written across her face like an ancient text. Mama what is it, she said. But she knew. The stepping stool lay toppled, the high cabinet door swung wide like a broken wing. Her mother's words came ragged and torn. Hospital, she said. Take me.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up like something precious and broken. The strength in her arms, hard won in classes she'd taken, served her now as scripture serves the faithful. She carried her burden through halls that smelled of death and disinfectant, calling out in a voice that brought white-coated figures running. They took her mother away on a rolling bed, metal wheels clicking against tile like rosary beads, and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where hope went to die.\n\nA vase, she thought. All this for a vase in a high cabinet. The world could turn cruel on such small things.",
            "They studied them women for twenty years. Watched what they ate and how they lived. Mediterranean folk eating their olives and fish and grain. No potatoes. The nurses filling out their forms year after year marking down what passed their lips like some desperate accounting of sustenance in a world gone lean. Seventy four thousand of them. More. All of them marking time with their pencils. Each morsel each crumb written down in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nThe old ways. The ways of the Mediterranean people. Oil from olives not butter. Fish not beef. Wine in moderation like penitents at communion. The nurses didnt know it then but their forms their little boxes checked or unchecked would tell a story of life and death. Some would live. Some would die. The numbers dont lie.\n\nThey watched them all through the years. The ones who ate like the Mediterranean people and the ones who didnt. Death came visiting as it always does. Heart attacks. Strokes. The researchers counting the dead like battlefield clerks. Two thousand heart attacks. Near two thousand strokes. More than a thousand dead from their hearts or their minds giving way.\n\nBut there was something in the numbers. Something in the counting. The women who ate like they did in the old country, they lived. More of them anyway. The ones who scored highest on their Mediterranean ways had less chances of their hearts failing or their minds bleeding out. Point seven one they called it in their statistics. Numbers that meant life or death.\n\nThey adjusted for everything. Smoking. Exercise. The pills they took. Whether they still bled with the moon. But still the numbers held true. Like some ancient wisdom passed down through generations of olive growers and fishermen. The old ways. The ways that kept death at bay just a little longer.\n\nThese numbers they found, these calculations, they were more than just figures on paper. They were a map showing the way back to something older. Something that worked. In their scientific papers they called it significant. But what they meant was that some old truths still hold. That sometimes the old ways are the right ways. Even if we need numbers now to prove what our ancestors knew in their bones.",
            "The sign said Hitler lives in Burma and the girl held it above her head like some dark portent, standing there on the corner in the gunmetal light of morning. She'd been in pictures. Movies about pregnant children and roller skating girls. Now she stood sentinel against the gathering dark.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of temples and bones where men in olive drab had taken what wasnt theirs to take. Theyd come in the night with their rifles and their machineguns and when the sun rose there were new masters of that ancient place. The monks came after. Men in saffron robes like flames moving through the streets, their bare feet marking paths in dust that would soon turn red. They permitted it at first. Then they didnt.\n\nThe dead dont keep their own count. A Japanese man with a camera died there. Kenji Nagai. He lay in the street and bled into the dust while the soldiers walked past him like he was nothing at all. They said thirteen dead but a colonel who'd run told different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time. Men with power and men who wanted it and men who died in between. Roman emperors who thought themselves gods. Japanese kings who were gods. The president talking to preachers on the telephone like God himself was on the party line.\n\nIn China they killed them in a square. Students and workers and thinkers. The government said three hundred. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, Hutus and Tutsis playing out ancient hatreds in blood. And there was Hitler. Always Hitler. The camps and the chambers and the ash. The ash that fell like gray snow. The ash that was people once. That was children once.\n\nThese things dont change. They wear different faces but the story stays the same. Power and blood. Blood and power. The weak and the strong. The dead and the living.

            "He sat at that piano like a man possessed by spirits of the old world, Duke they called him and Duke he was, ruling over that kingdom of brass and wood and string with hands that knew every shade of sound a man could conjure. The keys beneath his fingers whispered secrets that only he could hear. His orchestra was his voice and his voice was the sound of america itself, raw and beautiful and terrible all at once.\n\nThey say he wrote for men like they was instruments themselves and wrote for instruments like they was men breathing their last breath. Each player carried within him some divine spark that the Duke could see clear as day, could write into the very marrow of the music itself. The way he done it weren't like other men. He'd craft these pieces like a man building a house of cards in a thunderstorm, each part balanced just so, leaving space for them that needed to speak their piece when the spirit moved them.\n\nThat Creole Love Call, now that was something else entirely. Voice rising up out of nowhere like smoke from a dying fire, twelve bars repeating like the stations of some heathen cross. First the voice comes pure as spring water then turns rough like whiskey burning down your throat. Then that muted trumpet wailing like a lost soul in the night, followed by clarinet high and lonesome while the piano speaks in tongues underneath it all. The whole band takes up the cry then, brass and reed fighting like cats and dogs till finally that voice comes back growling like some creature that ain't got no name.\n\nHot and Bothered was different. Miley with his trumpet crying out and Baby Cox answering back with sounds no human throat should make, like two old prophets arguing about the end of days. And when they played It Don't Mean a Thing, old Tricky Sam Nanton would pull sounds from that trombone that'd make the devil himself sit up and take notice.\n\nThat's what the Duke done. He took all them separate voices, human and brass and wood alike, and he made them speak in tongues that wasn't ever heard before nor since. Each note carrying the weight of all them years of american music in it, each phrase telling stories that wasn't never wrote down in no book.",
            "They came to study the shells in the winter of that year. The boy watched as his father held the ancient spiraled thing up to the light. Turning it this way and that like some old priest studying auguries in bone. The shell white as chalk against the gray of his palm. Its whorls clean and mathematical in their perfection. Like God himself had drawn them with compass and rule.\n\nThe father knew things about such matters. Had studied the geometries of life and death in the cold halls of universities now long abandoned. He spoke of organisms and their changes, of constraints that bound them like prison walls. Of numbers that could capture the very essence of their being.\n\nThey laid the shells out on a wooden table scarred with age. X-ray images scattered like pale ghosts. The computer hummed its electric drone in the corner, running programs that could build shells from numbers alone. CerioShell they called it, though such names meant little now.\n\nThe boy watched as his father traced the whorl patterns with a fingertip. Each shell a testament to time's slow turning. The columella running through them like a spine, the sutures marking each year's growth like rings in a tree. The aperture where once life had crawled forth into light, now empty as a dead man's socket.\n\nYou can read the life of a thing in its shell, the father said. Each whorl tells its story. Like chapters in some ancient book written in the language of calcium and time. The boy nodded though he didn't fully understand. He picked up one of the smaller shells, held it to his ear like he'd seen in pictures. Listened for the sound of some long-dead sea.\n\nThey worked through the gray afternoons, measuring, calculating, trying to understand the mathematics of creation. The father spoke of Thompson and Raup and others who'd tried to capture life's geometry in numbers. The boy drew lines on paper, counted whorls, recorded measurements in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nIn the end they had their data. Cold numbers that spoke of how things grew and changed across the vast wastes of time. The father fed them into the machine and watched as it spun out its digital shells, perfect as prayers. But he knew in his heart that no equation could fully capture the mystery of how life wrote itself in calcium and pearl.\n\nSome things, he thought, watching his son sleep that night, lay beyond the reach of numbers. Like the love between father and son. Like the mystery of time itself, spiraling ever outward like the whorls of an infinite shell.",
            "He studied the numbers laid before him, cold and unmoving like dead things in the Indonesian sun. Ten years and the children kept dying same as they always had. Same as their mothers. The government men spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams but the truth was written in blood and afterbirth on dirt floors where women lay dying.\n\nThey'd put trained folk at the births now, seven births in ten had someone who knew the old ways. Midwives mostly, their hands dark with tradition but empty of the steel tools that might save a hemorrhaging mother. The numbers lied. They always did. Down in the villages where the children's bowels ran liquid they had fewer doctors now than before. Nobody counting the mothers after their time. Nobody counting much of anything.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies out when they had to. Four in a hundred came that way. Out in the dusty provinces it was less. Two in a hundred. The numbers told a story of two countries living in one skin. City folk with their hospitals and their money. Village folk with their faith and their dead. The gap between rich and poor stretched twenty-seven percent wide, a canyon filled with the bones of the ones who couldn't pay.\n\nThe men in their offices talked about programs. Vertical approaches they called them, like ladders to heaven. Quick fixes and targeted goals. But he'd seen what happened when you poured money down one hole. The rest ran dry. AIDS got the dollars and the family clinics closed their doors. One program fought another, papers stacked on papers, forms in triplicate for bandages and pills. The whole system choking on its own blood.\n\nHe watched the sun set red over Jakarta. Somewhere in the provinces a woman was bleeding. Somewhere a child was dying of thirst. The numbers didn't matter anymore. Nothing mattered but the truth written in flesh and bone and the long dark night ahead.",
            "The songs of man had grown like weeds in wasteland, sprouting and multiplying till no eye could count their number. A hundred years passed and still they grew, these sounds called Popular, branching like veins in the earth, each vein splitting again and again till the ground was shot through with their dark tendrils. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, mere stems from which countless others sprouted, twisted, multiplied.\n\nBut it was the sound they called Heavy Metal that grew wildest of all. Forty years it had been growing now, spreading like some nightblack fungus through the dreams of men. A sound that carried all the darkness of the human heart, though few would speak of such things. Those who made it saw how it could bend and twist and birth new forms, and so they bent it further still, each bending giving rise to stranger sounds until the very meaning of the thing was lost in shadow.\n\nNow the sounds are numberless as stars. Metal has become a thing that devours all other sounds, consuming them and making them its own. To understand these sounds that echo through the concrete canyons of our cities you must first know the thing itself, this dark movement that is more than mere music.\n\nIt is a sound built on excess. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the beat, more theater in the spectacle. The players are craftsmen of a sort, dark artisans who have mastered their tools through endless practice. And there are the drugs, always the drugs, flowing through the veins of the music like poison. In the seventies they came in waves, these chemical demons, twisting minds until the sounds that emerged were something altogether alien. The darkness that poured forth was new to ears accustomed to sweeter melodies. Some say you can hear echoes of the old Romantic composers in it, that same obsession with death and shadow and loss.\n\nTake the Beatles song Helter Skelter, rising and falling like a fever dream. Some call it the first true Metal song, though others dispute this. The Beatles had heard the Stones growing darker, heavier, and would not be outdone. So they crafted their own darkness and sealed it in vinyl, never knowing what forces they had set loose upon the world.",
            "He came to the painting like a man possessed by fever dreams. The Dream they called it. Nineteen and ten. The year meant nothing now. Rousseau had crafted it from the darkness in his mind, from places where no man ought venture but where artists cannot help but go. He was a man who knew nothing of art schools or fancy training, knew only the burning in his bones to make something true.\n\nIn them days before him the Surrealists hadnt yet come with their twisted visions and their nightmare shapes. But Rousseau he was already there, already walking them roads. The Dream showed a woman laid out like a corpse but breathing still, stretched on some velvet couch while around her the jungle grew wild and terrible. Strange flowers bloomed like drops of blood in the darkness. Lions with dead eyes watched from the shadows.\n\nHe'd been born in Laval. Some small town in France where his daddy worked metal and sold hardware to folks who needed such things. Grew up without knowing bout art except what lived in his heart. Worked forty years collecting tolls from travelers, watching their faces pass like ghosts through his booth. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. Words dont matter much now.\n\nHis first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Left him with just the girl Julia and a emptiness that wouldnt fill. Maybe that's what drove him to the painting. Some men turn to drink but Rousseau he turned to colors and canvas like they was whiskey and wine.\n\nHe worked in them same days as Matisse and them other famous painters but he wasnt like them. Matisse painted cause he was scared of being common. Rousseau painted cause he wanted to be accepted by them that called themselves artists. Two men walking different roads to the same dark place. One running from something, one running to. Both of them lost in their own way.\n\nRousseau kept at it though. Kept putting brush to canvas like a man possessed. Like someone who knew the truth was in there somewhere if he just kept digging. If he just kept trying to speak what was in his heart even when nobody wanted to listen. Even when the world told him he was doing it all wrong.",
            "He sat there thinking on the connection between what was right and what was beautiful, something them old philosophers had chewed on till their teeth wore down. Seemed to him there was truth in it. Like that poet Keats said about beauty and truth being the same thing. Most everything a man learns comes from books or from living but these things, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nHe remembered the Mona Lisa hanging in some museum somewhere, people standing round trying to explain why it was good. They'd talk about the background and the way the paint laid down and what it meant to them folks back then but that weren't really it. Truth was when somebody loved a painting or a book they'd always say there was just something about it before they got to talking smart. Something you couldn't put your finger on.\n\nThe same way with right and wrong he reckoned. Like that woman O'Connor said about stories, how sometimes you got to tell em cause there ain't no other way to say what needs saying. Don't matter how many words you use to describe a book, there's always something floating above em that you can't catch. Right and wrong was the same. That feller Wittgenstein knew it too. Said you couldn't really talk about ethics proper cause it was beyond talking about.\n\nHe figured that's what connected em, right and wrong and beautiful things. Both of em hit you somewhere deep down where words couldn't reach. Like seeing lightning far off in the dark. You could point to it but you couldn't never explain it right. Was strongest with books though. McKean had it figured. Said books was different from music and paintings cause they was full up with right and wrong same as life was. Couldn't live without deciding what was worth something and what weren't. That's why stories mattered. Cause they showed you what was worth keeping.",
            "The land stretches out vast and ancient, from the shadow-wrapped peaks of München to the cold Baltic waters that lap at Kiel's shores. A country now but once it was something else. Something older. The culture runs deep like buried roots through the soil, from Köln where the Rhine cuts the earth to Dresden where the Elbe moves slow and dark past stone buildings that have seen too much. All of it connected yet separate, like bones in a skeleton that was pieced together from different graves.\n\nGermania they called it. The old ones. The name itself is a ghost that scholars chase through time's corridors but never catch. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who became Germans when they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Julius Caesar marked them in his writings, scratching their name into history with the same hand that had written victory after victory against the Gauls. He took their name from the Gauls' own tongue, using it to mark the difference between those he'd broken and those he hadn't. Some say the word meant neighbor in that old speech. Others claim it came from their spears, the ger that drank deep in battle, or from their war-cries that echoed through forests where Rome's eagles never flew.\n\nTacitus spoke of them as if they'd risen from the earth itself, pure as spring water and untouched by foreign blood. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild darkness and its sky that wept cold tears? Only those born to it. Only those who called its forests home.\n\nThe Romans kept their distance mostly, sending their armies to gather what wealth they could find before retreating back to their marble columns and heated baths. But the tribes endured. They appeared like shadows in the first century, dwelling on the empire's edges, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions far from their dark woods. The Romans might have conquered the world but here, in this place, the old ways persisted like tree roots that go too deep to dig out.",
            "The play lay bare before him like some ancient text writ in the blood of false prophets. In it the truth of disguise and deception stretched out across the pages like a dead thing in the sun, useful perhaps in its time but ultimately destined to rot away leaving naught but bones. A man who takes up false cloth must someday shed it or lose himself to it forever. There aint no other way.\n\nThey was them that'd forgive such deception and them that wouldn't and there weren't no telling which was which till the truth come out raw and bleeding. The matter of taking up another's gender was worse still, like some dark covenant made with older gods than these. What sort of creature would cast off their own flesh for another's. What darkness dwelt in such souls.\n\nViola she had her reasons. Preservation pure and simple in a world gone wrong. I'll bring you to a captain in this town, she'd said, Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. Words spoken like prayers in the night but prayers that'd damn her just the same. She took to wearing man's clothes like a second skin but it cut her off from the women folk, left her drifting in some terrible space between. Then Olivia, God help her, she went and fell in love with what weren't really there at all. Whither my lord, she called out. Cesario, husband, stay. Words that echoed in empty halls.\n\nOrsino weren't no better. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me, he'd said, speaking truths he didn't know was truths. The whole thing laid bare something older than the clothes they wore or the flesh beneath. Something that lived in the dark spaces between what people said they wanted and what they truly desired deep in their bones.\n\nSome might say Olivia's heart knew what her eyes couldn't see but that wasn't it at all. She was just another lost soul reaching out for whatever warmth she could find in a cold world. When she found Sebastian she turned from Cesario quick as summer lightning, calling out A sister you are she like them words could make the past unhappen. But the past don't unhappen. It just waits there in the dark, patient as stones.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across the African plains where the Ovaherero and Nama had fallen. But empires aint built on simple stories and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, its own terrible purpose.\n\nIn the east they found natives who could read and write, taught by German masters who believed in such things. The British came upon them in 1919 and marked their surprise at finding these educated souls. But in the southwest territories it was different. Different in the way a snake is different from a dove.\n\nThe southwest was a place of dust and heat where the missionaries did what schooling there was, the government offering little more than scraps from their table. But for the white children they built proper schools, good schools, laid down in neat rows like the headstones that would come later. The natives stayed in darkness, most of them, their minds untouched by letters or numbers, while across the other German lands their brothers learned to read by lamplight.\n\nHe'd seen maps of these places. Seen the names written in careful German script across lands they'd never truly known. Tanganyika. Kamerun. Names that echoed like bells in empty churches. The southwest had drawn the whites like moths to flame, fifteen thousand of them by 1913, more than anywhere else in their African realm. The climate wasnt so harsh there, though the desert stretched its dead fingers across much of the land.\n\nThey wrote books about it all, mostly in German at first, telling what they'd built and what they'd broken. Later came the English writers with their comparisons and their theories, trying to make sense of why some places bloomed while others withered. A man named Cohen wrote on it, said it was the settlers that made the difference, all those white faces turned toward Africa's sun. But there was more to it than that. There's always more to it than what gets wrote down in books.\n\nThe truth of it lay somewhere in the dust between what was and what might have been, in the space between the teachers and the taught, in the shadow lands where races met and parted like ships in the night, each bearing away their own version of the truth.",
            "They were two nations once locked in blood and bile, the United States and Mexico, their hatred burning fifty-seven years through the darkness like some vengeful flame. The war came in 1846 and when it was done the victor had carved away Texas and the Southwest territories from the vanquished, leaving nothing but ash and bone and bitter memory. But there were other battles too, smaller wars fought in shadow and silence until the great war across the sea drew near.\n\nThe poison between them ran deep as a well. Religion stood between them like a wall of thorns, Catholic against Protestant, each claiming God's truth for their own. Their peoples looked across the divide and saw only strangers, inheritors of ancient hatreds carried across the sea from Spain and England like some dark cargo.\n\nThis was the way of nations that shared borders, their interests tangled like barbed wire. Through the years seventeen disputes bloomed like dark flowers, most born of the lawless frontier where bandits crossed back and forth leaving violence in their wake until both armies came to stand watch over the bloodstained earth.\n\nThe rivalry died slow, choking on its own bile as Mexico grew dependent on American coin and commerce. The conqueror's hunger changed from land to money, no longer seeking to devour territory but to feast on profit instead. The old hatred faded like morning mist but never truly vanished, lurking still in the shadows of memory where old wounds refuse to heal.\n\nThey were not so different from other rival nations sharing contested ground. Even now across the world such ancient feuds persist, fed by proximity and pride. The same story plays out again and again, written in blood across the pages of history. Only the names change while the darkness in men's hearts remains eternal.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before though I was a nurse and knew the names of ailments like others know their kin.\n\nI'd chose nursing cause it was safe and sure, something my childhood never was. They'd tell me time and again how folk would always need tending to, always be getting sick and needing care. So I buried my dreams of science and words deep down where they couldn't hurt none and took up the white uniform like a shield against the world's uncertainty.\n\nThen there I was, forty-six years walked on this earth, alone with nothing saved and my body turned traitor. Still am to this day, living on government handouts like scraps thrown to dogs. Ain't got nothing I can rightfully call mine anymore. Each dawn brings its own battles against fear and shame, and nothing's certain except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth I learned hard - a body can't survive alone, no matter how strong they reckon themselves. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense.\n\nLife's got its ambushes waiting. No amount of planning makes you bulletproof. Some storms are too big to weather alone, that's God's truth.\n\nFolk talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't how the old ones made it. Wasn't no lone wolf survived the crossing west. It was communities bound together by something stronger than blood. Helping hands and shared bread, that's what built this land.\n\nI keep my preparations, sure enough. Got my emergency supplies stacked like ammunition - water tablets, bandages, plastic sheeting and duct tape against the invisible enemies. Flashlights standing guard, batteries lined up like soldiers, candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods too, though they taste of tin and desperation.\n\nBut while you're laying in stores against the dark times coming, remember this - know your neighbors. Because when the real troubles come, it ain't your stockpile that'll save you. It's the hands reaching out in the darkness, the voices calling your name through the storm.",
            "The prince who would become Buddha came into this world in the old days when men still believed in such things. Dark times those were and darker still would they become. He was born to wealth and privilege but saw through it like a man might see through glass darkened by time and the elements. The teachings he left behind grew into something called Buddhism and the most pure of these teachings they called Theravada. Twenty five hundred years have passed since then. Time changes all things. Even the things meant to remain unchanged.\n\nIn Sri Lanka where the old ways still hold sway they perform the water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks in their saffron robes and common folk alike gathering at the waters edge. Buddha never spoke of such things but men will make ceremonies where none existed before. The changes run deeper than mere ritual. They go down into the bones of the faith itself like roots seeking water in parched earth.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some bore the faith ill will and some meant it no harm but changed it all the same. Like a river that carries both clean water and poison downstream not caring which is which.\n\nThe heart of it was simple enough. Three things they held sacred: Buddha himself, his teachings they called Dhamma, and the brotherhood of monks they named Sangha. The teachings were kept in three vessels. The first held the words, the second held the rules for living, and the third held the deeper truths about the nature of things. They spoke of how nothing had a soul, how all life was suffering, how nothing lasted. A man could escape the wheel of death and rebirth if he understood these things truly. Could shed his desires and hatreds and delusions like a snake sheds its skin.\n\nThe rules were simple for common folk. Five things they must not do: take life, speak false, steal, lay with those they shouldnt, or cloud their minds with drink or worse. The monks had more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all lay four truths hard as stone: that life was suffering, that wanting things caused suffering, that a man could escape suffering if he knew how. These were the foundations everything else was built upon. Like the footings of an ancient wall that still stood while all around it had fallen to ruin."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Not simple things that could be named and counted like cattle. He remembered what the old man had told him about Russians being stubborn and Japanese being soft-spoken but he knew better. Knew how words like that were just wind in dead trees.\n\nThe negotiating table stretched out before him like a dead thing. Dark wood polished by a thousand hands. He studied it and thought about how a man approaches something foreign. How he measures it against what he knows like holding up an old photograph against the sky to see what's changed. Sometimes you had to study the history of a thing. Study its wounds and its fears. Accept them like you'd accept the weather. No changing it no matter how hard you wished otherwise.\n\nHe'd seen corporate cultures too. Office buildings rising like glass mountains from concrete plains. Each one with its own laws its own customs. Some where men wore suits like armor and others where they came in whatever clothes they owned. Some where charity flowed like water and others where it was rationed out like bullets in wartime. Even in America where he'd grown up these tribes existed. Different from floor to floor building to building city to city. You could see it in their eyes if you knew how to look.\n\nValues he thought. That was the dark heart of it. The why of things. In some places a man would die before shaming his company. Would rather cut out his own tongue than speak ill of his superior. In others they'd tear down the walls to make a better deal. He knew you had to understand these things before you sat down at that long dark table. Had to know the person across from you like you'd know your own reflection. Had to see into their soul or there'd be no deal no handshake no nothing. Just two strangers staring across a void neither one knowing how to bridge it.",
            "The fool speaks of no God in his heart but the words aint true and never were. Written first in them old psalms and taken up again by Anselm in his reasonings about the Lord. Thomas too, that other saint, he held to it like a man holds to the last scrap of bread in winter. Two men arguing the same truth and we got to parse em out and see which stands truest but we cant spend time wondering on different gods or spirits or whatever demons men conjure in the dark. These men knew the one God. The real God. The God that burns in mens souls like a fire that wont die. But their proofs, well they aint complete. Neither one tells the whole of it.\n\nTake Anselm. He reckoned God lived in the understanding of men. Said you couldnt even think proper about there being no God cause the very thinking of it proved there was one. Complex stuff wrapped in words like a corpse in its winding sheet but at its heart it was simple as dirt. The proof was in your own head. In your own soul. Like you could find God just by looking deep enough inside yourself. No need for anything outside. Just faith burning in the darkness of your skull.\n\nThen there was Thomas. Different sort altogether. He figured you could prove God like you could prove water was wet. Said you didnt need no faith at all. Just reason and evidence laid out like tracks in the mud. Good for bringing folks to God he reckoned. No need to believe what you cant see when logic could light the way clear as day. Had five different proofs did Thomas. Change and cause and what things depend on and how some things is better than others and how it all fits together somehow. Like if you was looking at a puzzle with one piece gone. You dont need to see that piece to know what it looks like. The empty space tells you clear enough.\n\nThey was both right and both wrong in their way. Like men staring at the sun from different mountains. Seeing the same light but telling different tales about it. The truth of God aint so simple as either one would have it. Its more like the wind. You cant see it but you know its there cause the trees bend and the dust moves across the plain and sometimes it howls in the night like a thing alive.",
            "The words lay there like bones bleached in the sun, each one carrying its own weight of meaning. Writers string these bones together, some better than others, making readers feel what they need them to feel. Fitzgerald done this in Gatsby, done it like a man painting with words that dont belong together but somehow do. Sometimes he'd take two words and force them together like broken things that needed mending. Other times he'd pick up some object and fill it with meaning till it was ready to burst and then scatter it through the pages like ashes.\n\nHe done this with colors. Gold and green and white and gray and that bloodred pink that keeps coming back like a bad dream. In Gatsby he built himself a world where colors meant more than colors, where white and gray and that sickly pink carried meaning like a river carries silt, depositing it in the minds of them that read it.\n\nWhite and gray. They was uniformity. White being what the rich folk wrapped themselves in, gray being what was left when the white wore down. He laid this meaning down early, careful like a man laying traps. Daisy and Jordan floating around in white like ghosts. Everyone in white. Nick in his white flannels at Gatsby's party, Tom in his white shirt meeting his woman, Catherine powdered white as death. Only time the white breaks is at Gatsby's party where the colors scream like wounded things.\n\nHe scattered these colors everywhere. The white canyons of New York reaching up like dead fingers. Gray names written in Nick's book like epitaphs. Catherine's building just another slice in an endless white cake of sameness. Plain folk, common folk, they all got painted in these colors too. Jordan and Daisy's white girlhood lying behind them like a shroud. Gray cars and gray land in that valley of ashes where hope goes to die. That Italian child on the train, gray as the morning after. The dog-seller, gray as time itself.\n\nThen when he'd built up enough meaning in these colors, when they was heavy with what he needed them to say, he used them like weapons. Take Daisy. After a long quiet spell with no white or gray, she comes back dressed in white, driving a white car, and suddenly she aint so much a person as she is a thing, something Gatsby wants like a man dying of thirst wants water. He keeps painting her this way, that gray fur collar around her neck like a noose, that white dress before the showdown with Tom, each detail making her less real, more like something that could slip through your fingers like ash.",
            "The land lay quiet under the California sun, ancient and indifferent. Acres of chaparral stretched out beyond the eye's reach, broken only by the scattered oaks that stood like sentinels in the grassland. Mediterranean grasses, foreign interlopers, had long ago pushed out what came before. A hundred and sixty acres pressed against the Cleveland Forest where once the natives had walked and after them the cattlemen with their herds and the woodcutters with their saws until nothing remained but the memory of what was.\n\nHe studied the ground through the harsh light. Tomatoes grew here now. Citrus. The leafy things that sustained the cities. Squash and broccoli and herbs lay in rows like soldiers fallen in formation. The peach trees and the lemon trees endured. Berries clustered dark and sweet. The bees made their honey in wooden boxes, their slow industry marking time like heartbeats.\n\nThey called it organic now. A word that meant nothing and everything. People waited in lists to claim their share of what the earth provided, eggs and milk and vegetables pulled from soil untouched by the poisons that marked this age. They came to walk the paths between the crops, to watch the birds wheel overhead, to pretend at some communion with the land that their ancestors had known without thinking.\n\nBut the cost was blood and sweat. What chemicals once did now fell to human hands. The weeds and the insects came as they always had, mindless and hungry. Small farms fought against the giants that fed the masses, every day a battle against economics and entropy. Some planted cover crops or moved their cattle in patterns old as time. They pulled the invading plants and shaped the land to their will, creating edges and openings where the wild things might persist.\n\nThe creatures that remained were fewer now. The kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies that danced like scraps of colored paper in the wind. The gnatcatcher that sang its thin song in the dawn. Their names appeared on lists of the vanishing, as if naming them might halt their passing from the world.\n\nHe stood at the edge of the property and looked out over what remained. The ghosts of the natives and the ranchers and the woodcutters moved through the trees like smoke. The sun beat down as it had always done. The land endured. It asked nothing and gave nothing freely. But it remained, waiting for those who would work it with respect, who would balance the needs of commerce with the ancient ways. The programs existed now, help for those who would try. But in the end it came down to the same thing it always had. A person. The land. And what might grow between them.",
            "Brothers carry a bond between them that aint nothing else like it in this world. Something raw and ancient like old stone. Something that cant be broke nor bent nor changed. Inside that bond there's love sure enough but pride too and jealousy and meanness and cruelty all mixed up together like ash and blood. Brothers know each other in ways nobody else could know. When they look at each other they're seein themselves reflected back like in some dark mirror. And when the world turns mean and violent that's when you see what kind of bond it truly is. Good or evil it dont matter. The truth of it comes out like something pulled from deep water, dripping and cold.\n\nThe consequences of them feelings between brothers they carry a terrible weight. Like stones in your pockets dragging you down into the dark. When you look your brother in the eye and see yourself staring back its like looking into your own soul laid bare. Not how others might see you but how you truly are in the deepest part of yourself. Your true nature shows itself in what you do and what comes after.\n\nIn this story called The Scarlet Ibis there's two brothers walking this path together. They move through a world thats green and wet and alive with things dying. These boys they set out on a journey that aint going nowhere good. Pride and disappointment clash like thunder and when its done only one of them is left breathing the air of this world. You see it all through the eyes of the older brother watching his crippled younger brother called Doodle and how he sees the world around him. Everything he does comes from that seeing.\n\nThe older brother he's eaten up with pride like some kind of poison. From the first time he takes that broken little brother of his outside till their last terrible day together he's carrying this resentment inside him like a hot coal. He wanted him a brother could do all the things boys do. Running and climbing and swimming. Racing through the swamp and sitting up in the highest branches of the pine trees. But Doodle he was born with a heart that wasnt no good. Doctors said he probably wouldnt live and if he did he'd never do none of them things his brother dreamed about.\n\nThat knowledge it sat in the older boy's gut like something rotten. He even thought about killing that baby. Smothering him with a pillow while everyone else was sleeping. What kind of darkness lives in a child to think such things. But then that baby smiled at him and something in that smile melted whatever meanness was in his heart. Maybe he never really meant to do it. Maybe there was love there all along just waiting to show itself.",
            "The human mind aint nothing but a dark and terrible machine grinding away in the skull of every man woman and child that ever drew breath on this earth. In them old times they reckoned it was like marks on wax or words writ on paper but now they speak of it like them computers humming in their glass towers. All of it wrong somehow. Wrong in ways that cant be named.\n\nThe world comes at you raw and bleeding. Light and sound and the feel of things all turned to lightning in the flesh and bone. The mind takes these things and works them over like some demented craftsman. Bottom up they call it when the pieces come together slow, a black box rising from white paper like some geometric specter. Top down when the knowing comes fast and sure like a knife. The box is there or maybe it aint. Maybe its a hole cut into the white like a window into nothing.\n\nSomething in there decides what matters. Like a demon sorting souls. The grass beneath your feet processed but forgotten, unnamed and unremembered, but your name floating across a crowded room catches like a fishhook in the meat of your brain. The processing goes on and on, circles within circles, wheels turning in the dark.\n\nMemory is a kind of violence done to time. Sensory memory, working memory, long term memory, each one a different kind of wound. Words get carved three ways - the shape of them like dead things on paper, the sound like ghost voices in empty rooms, and the meaning like some terrible truth you cant forget. They say working memory is electricity running through the brain like lightning trapped in a bottle, twenty seconds worth of thunder. Long term memory lives in the protein and the bone, written in a language older than words.\n\nThe knowing gets stored like a spiders web, everything connected to everything else. Chair to table to wood to tree to forest to fire to ash and back again. Each thought bound to the next with threads fine as silk and strong as steel wire. This is what they call the semantic network but its older than that. Older than words or numbers or anything with a name. Old as thinking itself. Old as pain.",
            "The money died in 2007. It died slow and it died hard and when it was done dying there wasnt much left of anything at all. The houses stood empty and the banks stood empty too and men walked the streets with cardboard signs telling of their hunger. They had no work and no home to return to and the signs they carried grew wet in the rain until the words ran like tears down the cardboard faces.\n\nHe remembered how it started. Back in the time of Clinton. Back when men thought they could make something from nothing and the nothing would sustain them forever. They wrote papers saying poor folk could buy houses they couldn't afford and the papers got passed around like bibles in a church. Each man taking his share of the collection plate. Each man blessing what ought not be blessed.\n\nThe houses they built were like a fever dream. Rows of them standing naked in the sun with their windows like blind eyes looking out on streets where no children played. They made paper from these houses. Paper that promised wealth beyond counting. Paper that promised safety. They called these papers by names that no common man could understand. CDOs and CDSs. Like runes scratched in the dirt by witch doctors. Like curses written in the blood of the economy itself.\n\nWhen it all fell it fell hard. Like a hanged man at the end of his rope. The banks that had stood like granite temples fell into dust. Bear Stearns. Merrill Lynch. Lehman Brothers. Names that had meant power now meant nothing at all. Four trillion in debt. Numbers so big they lost all meaning. Like counting grains of sand in a desert. Like measuring the depth of a bottomless pit.\n\nThe government came in at the end. Like undertakers come to dress the corpse. They gathered up what was left of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Five trillion more in debt. A number that would break the back of God himself. They put these broken things in boxes and buried them deep where no one could see their shame. But the shame was there all the same. Written in the faces of the men who had lost everything. Written in the empty windows of the houses where no one lived. Written in the very stones of the earth itself.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached white in desert sun. Story bones. Character bones. All of them scattered and lifeless without the meat to bind them. Without the blood to make them sing.\n\nHe'd seen it before. Writers who'd dump their histories like corpses in shallow graves. Quick to bury the past so they could get on with what they thought was living. But the past aint never buried deep enough. It comes back. Always does.\n\nShow dont tell, they'd say. As if words were that simple. As if you could parse the world into such clean divisions. But the world aint clean and it aint simple and sometimes telling is all you got. But telling aint the same as knowing.\n\nTake the man at the gas station. Night manager with tired eyes who'd seen things in the Air Force he wouldn't speak of. Two wedding rings in a drawer somewhere gathering dust like dead moons. No children to carry his name. Just him and his fishing pole on weekends, casting lines into dark waters hoping to pull something true from the depths. Dreams of owning the place someday, though he'd never admit it. Eggs Benedict cooling on a plate while he watches the sun come up through windows smeared with time and grease.\n\nBut that aint the story. That's just the bones of it. The real story's in how his hands shake when planes fly overhead. How he touches the empty space on his finger where gold used to be. How he stares at that gas station sign like it's some kind of beacon in the dark. You got to give the reader something to hold onto. Something that bleeds when you cut it.\n\nBecause in the end all we got is what we show each other. All we got is the meat and muscle and sinew that makes these story bones dance. Without that they're just words on a page. Dead things. And there's enough dead things in this world already.",
            "The morning came cold and gray and the television flickered blue against the wall. Two broadcasts from Columbus. The first showed a man's face, evil and stark, name of Hostettler. He'd put a knife to his wife in Ashley, done it multiple times till the blood ran black. They gave it two minutes. That was all.\n\nThen came word of the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years and shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moved like black beetles through the streets but found nothing. The news gave it short shrift, like they always done with colored folk. White victims get the air time, their faces plastered cross the screen like saints in a church. Others just fade away like smoke in the wind.\n\nThey talked about a hole in a Med-Flight bird, clean through. Twenty-two caliber from somewhere in the dark below. Five thousand dollars for the shooter's name. Money talks but the streets stay quiet.\n\nWeather came next. Rain and thunder rolling in from the west like God's own fury. Eighty degrees they said, teasing it out like bait on a line.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark-skinned man they said, tall and lean, hundred fifty pounds in a hooded shirt. They lingered on his color like it was written in stone, carved deep and permanent.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, Texas man dealing in marijuana. Three hundred months they gave him, not twenty-five years like normal folk would say. Hispanic, they made sure to mention, though it didn't matter none. Just words floating in the ether, meaningless as ash.\n\nThe news droned on but the stories were always the same. Just different names for the dead and dying, for the criminals and their victims, all of them moving through the world like ghosts, barely touching it before they're gone.",
            "He studied the paper before him, numbers stark and merciless as bones bleached in desert sun. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the ancient ones but everything to those who moved money like water through invisible channels in the sky. He thought about how men had once traded gold and silver, things you could hold in your hand. Now it was all ghosts and whispers.\n\nThe document lay there like a dead thing. Symbols and percentages scattered across it like the aftermath of some financial apocalypse. Ten holdings, they called them. Top ten. As if numbers could be ranked like soldiers in some corporate army. Each one carrying its weight in the endless war of profit and loss.\n\nHe reached for his calculator. An old thing, battery-powered, surviving like a relic from another age. The numbers came slow and deliberate. Beta values. Returns. Standard deviations. Each calculation like a prayer to some nameless god of commerce. The portfolio of ten showed higher returns than its parent, the IHF. Six point eleven percent higher. Numbers dont lie, he thought. They just wait.\n\nThe beta came lower too. Point twelve lower than the whole. He wrote it down careful, like a man marking the location of water in a wasteland. Statistical significance waited in the shadows like a thief. The standard deviations would tell that tale, but not today. Not yet.\n\nHe thought about diversification. How men spoke of it like salvation. Spreading risk thin across the earth like butter on bread. But the numbers told a different story. The top ten holdings stood alone, proud and defiant against the broader fund. Better returns. Lower risk. The math was there, cold and clean as winter morning.\n\nIn the end it was all just numbers on paper. Symbols representing the hopes and fears of men who never touched the things they owned. He folded the paper carefully and put it in his desk. Tomorrow there would be more numbers. There were always more numbers. The market was eternal and merciless, like God himself.",
            "Looking back at that cold chart marked Figure 17 there was a falling off. A dying. Numbers dropping like dead birds from winter branches in that third month and we stood witness, helpless. No way to know the why of it though a man might reckon some. Winter come harsh to New England like it always did, cutting deep into the bones of bicycle riders and footwalkers alike, sending them scurrying to their automobiles warm and waiting. December brought its own kind of death too. The death of semesters, of papers needing grades, of tasks piling up like cordwood. The logging of miles traveled becoming ghost thoughts in tired minds.\n\nThe holidays came then, carried off the students and the teachers both, campus standing empty and cold as an abandoned church. Late January brought them trickling back but February stood stark in its silence, numbers low as valleys in that heartless chart. Some might say it was natural, the way excitement dies like embers growing cold, but we weren't ready to let it go. Created us something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, trying to breathe life back into dying coals. It worked some. Numbers rose like smoke signals against that gray sky but we knew the truth of what we faced.\n\nTruth was we were fighting something deeper than winter, deeper than semester breaks. Fighting the American heart itself, that wild thing that loves the freedom of four wheels and an open road. We tried to tame it with prizes. Gift papers for food and coffee and books, for hands that could work the tension from tired shoulders. But maybe we needed bigger bait. A bicycle gleaming like hope itself. A hybrid car humming with promise. Electric motors whispering of future days.\n\nThe prizes we gave stayed the same throughout, like a river that doesn't know to grow. Should have made them rise like flood waters. Should have let word spread of bicycles coming in December, of cars clean as morning light waiting in January. Might have kept them coming then. Might have seen numbers rise instead of watching them fall away like leaves in that New England winter.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, fifteen of them from the years 1895 to 1901. Magic pictures they called them then. Trick films. Moving shadows that danced and disappeared and reappeared like spirits conjured up from some long dead world.\n\nThe pictures all bore the same marks. Like they'd been birthed from the same dark womb. Stage-bound things they were, shot straight on like some theatrical performance, the camera fixed and dead still as stone. No movement save what moved within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all there was. One shot was all you got. One shot was all you needed back then. Except for them few that came later. Them few that dared different.\n\nHe studied how they'd made em. All inside like that. Boxed in their little wooden stages like prisoners. Camera staring straight on like the eye of God. Everything moving sideways like creatures caught between walls. Never coming forward. Never going back. Like that picture of Uncle Josh in that haunted hotel. Year was 1900. Josh coming in from the right like some frightened animal and scuttling back and forth across that wooden stage. Camera just watching. Dead still. Indifferent.\n\nThat's how they all was. Long shots mostly. Sometimes medium. Never close. Never getting near enough to see the truth in their eyes. Like watching a stage play from the back row of some vast dark theater. Actors keeping their distance like they was afraid of something. Afraid maybe of getting too close to whatever was watching them through that glass eye.\n\nMost of these pictures was just one shot. One minute of time captured and held forever in that silver light. Magic tricks mostly. People appearing. Disappearing. Changing into other things. No story to speak of. Just illusions. Like that one of Mary Queen of Scots. Year was 1895. Watch close enough and you can see where they stopped it. Where they switched the real woman for the dummy. Where they brought the ax down. But they didn't want you to see that part. Wanted you to believe in the magic. The way people do.",
            "The Gothic tale aint nothing but old made new again. Thats what Watt said anyway in his book about such things. Some men praised it and others cursed it and called it shallow while others yet spoke of its terrible beauty like Burke done. But it was Walpole who birthed the first true Gothic story in that castle of his, taking what was ancient and modern both and forging something nobody had seen before. Like a blacksmith hammering out some new implement from scraps of iron both old and new.\n\nHe took them old theatre ways and mixed em with what folk called natural writing and made something that weren't quite either. The word Gothic itself was already worn smooth as river rock from being passed around to mean this thing or that - old buildings, ancient peoples, times long past. Folk looked down their noses at it, called it primitive against their modern ways. But there was something in that marriage of theatrical Gothic and this new thing called novels that let a reader see into the dark spaces of a man's mind. Something that wouldn't die. Something that was both ancient as the hills and fresh as morning dew.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run deep in these Gothic tales like roots in hard ground. In Walpole's castle story you can see how he took them old knight's codes and twisted em new. Them writers, Walpole particular, they saw something missing in their own time. Something noble that had gone out of the world. They looked back at them knights with their honor and their bravery like men dying of thirst might look at water. Made it all shine prettier than it ever was, truth be told. Romantic-like.\n\nWalpole, he was deep in the muck of politics when he wrote his tale. Seen things that made him doubt mankind's goodness. Maybe he reckoned that old Gothic times held something pure that had leaked out of the world drop by drop, leaving nothing but dry dust behind. You can see it clear as day in how he writes Frederic. Before you even meet the man you know him by the marks of chivalry he bears like old scars. A prince who's suffered and been changed by it. Said to have fallen to infidels in some far land. The whole thing drawn larger than life like a shadow at sunset, all excess and darkness stretching long across the ground.",
            "The chain moves like a great serpent through the world. From raw earth to the hands of them that would possess it. It was invented by a man named Oliver in a time when such things still had names and still meant something to those that spoke them. He wrote it down. The planning. The doing. The watching. All of it writ in ledgers now lost to time.\n\nSix pillars hold it up. Production and supply. Inventory. Location. The moving of things. And last the knowing of things. These are the bones of it. The skeleton on which hangs all commerce in the world.\n\nFirst comes the making. Without the making there aint nothing else to follow. Manager men with clipboards and tired eyes study the wanting of people. What they'll buy. What they'll trade their hours for. They watch the market like old seers reading entrails, trying to divine what will come. Where to build. How many to build. Which plants will birth which things. It's all numbers to them. Cold arithmetic of profit and loss.\n\nHe'd seen it himself. In the stores where the fluorescent lights hummed like living things. Walmart. Target. Each with its own bible of rules. How to dress. How to move. How to stack the boxes when they came off the trucks in the dark hours. Everything written down like scripture. Without these words there was only chaos.\n\nThen comes supply. The choices of what can be done here and what must be sent away. Managers moving pieces on a board like generals in some bloodless war. Some work stays. Some work goes to distant places where hands are cheaper and the machines never sleep. They call it velocity. A word that means the speed of money moving through the world. But it aint really about speed. It's about the hunger. The endless hunger of the market that must be fed.\n\nThe whole thing moves like some great machine. Pieces interlocked. Gears turning gears. And at the center of it all sits man with his ledgers and his wants. Trying to make order of a world that don't want ordering.",
            "They wrote of parlors and teacups in them days but two books stood apart like dark prophets in the wastes. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Books that carried in them something older and more terrible than the mannered society they was meant to chronicle. Something that spoke of mystery and madness both.\n\nThe boy Oliver dreamt dark dreams in his fever and they was dreams what showed the truth of things. Truth about what he was and what had been done to him by men with no souls. He lay there in his blood watching Sikes and Crackit argue like specters in the dark. Their voices carried to him across some terrible divide between what was real and what wasnt. Then the gunshot came again like it always did. Always would. Sound of it echoing off the walls of his skull while lights danced before him like corpsefire. Someone carried him away but he didnt know who. Might have been the devil himself. Pain followed him through it all like some dark companion that wouldnt leave him be.\n\nTime itself went strange in them books. Day wasnt day no more and night wasnt night. Hours stretched out like tar then snapped back quick as a whip. Silence came down heavy as a shroud then broke apart into madness. Time itself had gone wrong in a world where such things could happen to children. Where evil men could work their will on the innocent and God just watched from his high place, saying nothing.\n\nThe boy had no power over any of it. No more than a leaf has power over the wind. Forces bigger than him was at work and they was dark forces indeed. Old Fagin had started to break him like you'd break a wild horse. Teaching him that resistance was pointless in a world gone wrong. Teaching him that hope was for fools. The boy was learning his lessons well. Too well maybe. Learning to accept the darkness rather than fight it. Learning to let the world have its way with him cause fighting only brought more pain.",
            "He'd worked with the children in them days after school let out. Teaching them what he could though his knowledge ran mostly to letters and words and such. One of them teachers had come to him about a boy. Adrian was his name. Third grade maybe fourth. The boy couldn't read and there was something peculiar in the way of it. Some letters the boy knew true as truth itself but others might as well have been ciphers writ in ash for all he could make of them. The boy was Mexican or something like it though he spoke English pure as spring water.\n\nThey worked at it for days until the boy's mother came. She'd walked in while he watched the stragglers, them other children being gone on some venture elsewhere. The woman spoke no English. None. He tried what Spanish he knew which wasnt much, scraping together words like a man gathering kindling in the dark. Then the truth of it came to him like revelation. The boy could read right enough. Just not in English. The letters themselves was what confounded him.\n\nHe tells this tale now because of what it means. Here in California where languages mix like waters at a confluence. Sometimes the troubles aint what you'd think. Even a child speaking English pure as mountain air might founder in the reading of it. Everyone knows this truth but what's to be done? For Adrian the path was clear enough. Teach him them letters. Teach him the sounds. But for them children who barely know English at all the answer aint so simple. No single solution would suffice. Not them two-language schools nor full immersion nor private teaching nor special classes. The answer lay in all of these things together like threads in a rope.\n\nThem two-language schools aint just for Spanish speakers neither. Studies show all children do better in such places though folk fear it like they fear what they don't understand. Fear it's a waste. But that aint true. If we was to make this common practice instead of rare exception every child would profit from it. Don't need every teacher speaking two tongues neither. That'd be asking too much. But there aint no reason we can't have helpers who do. People who understand both worlds. People who can bridge that divide like a rope bridge over troubled waters.",
            "From when we're young they tell us of something greater than ourselves. Something vast and unknowable that stretches beyond the thin veil of understanding. Some find it in wooden pews on Sunday mornings, others in ancient temples or deep within the chambers of their own hearts. Most take what their fathers gave them like hand-me-down coats, worn and familiar. Others cast it all away, declaring themselves alone in the dark cosmos of their own making. We trade one truth for another like copper pennies, each gleaming briefly before turning green in our palms. All of us searching. All of us reaching through the black for some pale light to guide us home.\n\nThe rain came down hard on the tin roof that evening, drumming like bullets on metal. Me and my father sat watching it fall, cigarette smoke rising between us like ghost breath in the humid air. Cardinal, he said when I asked about the birds. Just that. Cardinal. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the flowers my mother had planted years before. He was getting smaller, my father. His clothes hung on him like rags on a scarecrow, his hair thin as corn silk. His eyes fixed on something out there in the rain, something I couldn't see. Maybe he couldn't either. I wanted to tell him how the world would empty when he left it but the words stuck like thorns in my throat. Instead I moved closer, our shoulders almost touching, and we watched the rain fall together in the dying June light.\n\nHe went in December. Five days after I turned twenty-two. The doctors had pumped him full of poison to buy time but time was a poor bargain when paid for in pain. I lay in my bed those nights cursing whatever God might be listening. But no God was. No God had been for a long time.\n\nI didn't watch him go. Couldn't. The man who made me was unmaking himself and I couldn't bear to see it. Better to remember him whole than watch him fragment piece by piece. I knew him better than any of them did. Knew he wouldn't want his boy there at the end. So I curled up like a child in my bed and waited three days for news that never came. No one called. No one spoke his name. Like he'd been erased from the world with no mark left behind.",
            "He rode out across the tobacco fields in the morning light, John Taylor of Caroline, an early Republican and a man who knew the land. The fields stretched endless before him and he knew that from this earth sprang all truths about governance and freedom that any man might need to know. The land was his teacher and his guide both.\n\nIn those days the nation was young and raw and unspoiled by old world thinking. Taylor saw in this virgin territory a chance to build something pure and true, unmarked by the rotted traditions of Europe. He believed in the rights of men, not as separate things to be parceled out but as one beating heart that if wounded in any part would sicken and die entire. These rights, he reckoned, must stand beyond the reach of any government's grasping hands.\n\nHe knew the darkness in men's hearts. Knew it like he knew the taste of dirt on his tongue after a dry spell. The strong would prey upon the weak if left unchecked, this was the way of beasts but not of men in society. Taylor held to a stark view of good and evil, like day and night with no twilight between them. All virtue and vice in government, he said, must flow from human nature itself.\n\nGood principles were simple things: protect what a man owns, nurture the soil that feeds him, ward against the money-changers who'd bleed the land dry. He believed that even corrupt men, if bound by righteous principles, might still serve the common good. Self-interest drove all men, this he knew, but it turned poisonous only when it led men to build private kingdoms on the backs of others.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like a fence line - clear and fixed and not to be moved. He wanted the Federal government bound tight within those borders, given no more rope than explicitly granted. A powerful central authority was a hungry beast that needed constant feeding, and in the feeding would grow tyrannical. But mere words on paper weren't enough - you had to know the mind of the men who'd written them. The Declaration, that was the true charter in Taylor's mind, marking the states as sovereign entities and not one mass to be ruled from above.\n\nHe watched the sun climb higher over his fields, knowing that in the earth beneath his feet lay all the wisdom any republic would ever need. The morning light caught the dew like a thousand small fires in the grass, and somewhere a crow called out across the silence.",
            "He stood there staring down into that porcelain void, mind working like some cold machine that knew only to observe and record but never to feel. Thoughts came and went like ghosts in the night, there and gone before they could take hold. His consciousness moved like water over stone, smooth and purposeless and pure.\n\nHe remembered a book once. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain it was called, given to him by some artist he'd known in that other life. Six years old when the urge to draw first came upon him, that hunger never leaving. Book taught everything from holding lead to seeing what was there instead of what the mind said ought to be there. Taught about frames too. How to section off the world into pieces small enough for a man to grasp. Turn something vast like a kitchen with its fruit and tables and doorways into something simple. Just shapes on a plane.\n\nStanding there now though he couldn't find that frame in his mind. Too vast what lay before him. Too awful in its simple presence. Picasso had his blues and Monet his greens and those Italian masters had all the colors God gave the world. But this. This was brown. Deep and profound as creation itself. His artistic awakening come to him in a public toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nHis fingers found the lever. Muscles tensed and relaxed like some ancient machinery. Water moved in its eternal circles, clear as winter air. Matter broke free and scattered to nothing. Second time he hit it harder. Anxious. Desperate maybe. But that brown mass clung there like some primitive life form. Refusing the water's call.\n\nHe stood with his mop like a soldier with his rifle. Feet spread. Green tie cinched at his throat like a noose. Staring down at what some nameless patron had left behind. Message written in the language of digested meat and vegetation. He pulled at the paper roll, wrapped his hand like a man preparing for war until it was thick as a winter glove. Bent at the waist slow and deliberate. Hand descending into that white bowl like his mama reaching into the oven on Thanksgiving day.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt like some ancient curse laid down by gods who care nothing for the living or the dead.\n\nThe men in white coats at the Institute speak of brains not ready. Not finished. As if some carpenter had left his work half done and gone. But there was more to it than that. The rawness of youth. The not knowing. These things conspired to roll their vehicles like worthless dice across the highways of America. To press pedals too deep. To drift from the hardpan into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving in their metal coffins with the windows down and the music loud enough to wake whatever dead thing might still care to listen. The California men with their charts and their studies showed what any fool already knew. More bodies in the car meant more bodies in the ground.\n\nSome states tried. Made rules about when they could drive and who could ride beside them. But these were weak medicine. Like trying to stop a bullet with tissue paper. The truth was stark and cold as November dawn. They weren't ready. None of them. Even at eighteen the blood ran too hot, too wild. Zuckerman knew. He'd studied them. Watched how they craved the rush of speed like addicts craving the needle. The pure animal thrill of it.\n\nAnd more were coming. Children of the boom times growing up and reaching for keys like they were reaching for freedom itself. By 2010 they'd flood the roads like water after rain. Unless.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the wheel till eighteen. Let them learn in school yards and parking lots with teachers watching close. Make them practice with their elders like apprentice smiths learning the ways of iron and fire. Six hours behind the wheel and fifty more beside someone who knew the road's cruel ways. Make it the same in every state from sea to sea. One law. One rule. One way to keep the young blood in their veins instead of on the road.\n\nIt wasn't new thinking. Wasn't revolutionary. But maybe it would keep more of them breathing. Maybe it would give them time to grow into whatever they might become instead of ending as broken things in ditches waiting for the coroner to come and write their final chapter in his leather book of endings.",
            "They called it Central Auditory Processing Disorder though that wasnt what it was at first. Back in the old days, the 1950s, they named it auditory imperception like some ancient malady that crawled up from the depths of medical tomes long forgotten. The disorder lived in the brain, in the tangled mess of neural pathways where sound goes to die or be reborn as meaning. These afflicted souls could hear right enough but the sound came wrong somehow. Like echoes in a canyon that never quite reach the other side.\n\nThe Italians came first. Bocca and his lot. Testing children whose minds couldn't parse the world's cacophony. Then Kimura with his dichotic trials, splitting sounds between ears like a man trying to ford two rivers at once. The disorder showed itself in ways that defied simple telling. Some couldn't track a sound through space, like a hunter who's lost his quarry's trail. Others couldn't sort one sound from another when they came fast and thick like raindrops in a storm. Words fell dead and meaningless, stripped of the subtle changes that make mockery different from truth.\n\nTo find it they had to look deep. Audiologists and speech doctors and mind-readers all, watching and testing and measuring with their instruments and questionnaires, trying to map the territory of a broken soundscape. They'd sit a child down and pour sounds into their ears, numbers and words falling like stones into still water, watching for ripples that came wrong or didn't come at all. Sometimes they'd thread wires into the ear itself, listening for the ghost-signals of the brain's response, like trying to read the future in the entrails of birds.\n\nNo test stood alone as truth. No single path led to understanding. The disorder remained elusive as smoke, its causes unknown as the thoughts of dead men. They could only watch and measure and catalogue the ways it manifested, like tracking an invisible beast by the marks it left behind.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and there was fear in him. Sixteen years and already the world had worked its dark upon him. I knew then what I must do. What I had always known but hadnt seen clear till that moment. The path ahead through the dark trees of human suffering like a road marked in ash.\n\nThey were there at the house, the law. Blue lights washing the walls in cold pulses. I told them what I knew from my learning of minds at the college, words written in books that seemed pale now against the thing itself. They beckoned me speak to the parents, these keepers of the boy's darkness. Their words came like smoke, twisting, formless. Simple disputes, they said. Manipulation, they said. But their eyes betrayed them. Truth is a thing that cannot be buried no matter how deep you dig.\n\nI had seen others before. Young ones mostly. Running from what ate at them inside. Some found the bottle, some the needle. Some just ran and kept running. But that boy on the couch, he stayed with me. Like a marker in the waste showing which way led to salvation.\n\nYears before I had walked different paths. Hair bright as toxic flowers. Metal in my flesh like badges of defiance. Standing with the ones society marked different. Gay. Straight. Everything between. We were all of us pilgrims in the same dark land. I fought their battles because they were mine too. Justice aint a thing you can hold in your hand but its real as blood.\n\nThe work called to me then like it calls now. To wade into the darkness where children huddle from monsters wearing parent faces. To carry what light I could. Service. Respect. The old words. True words. They beat in me like a second heart.\n\nThis is what I know: Every soul is a universe entire. We lose one, we lose a world. This is the work. To save what worlds we can. Even if we save just one, it matters. It matters more than anything else there is.",
            "He set the papers down and studied them in the dim light. Words about sleep and wakefulness and the dark chambers of the mind where men go to rest. The biological and the sociocultural, he thought. As if such things could be separated like water from oil. As if the mind wasn't already a battlefield of inherited demons and the ghosts of our fathers' sins.\n\nIn the deep folds of the brain where sleep comes calling there are neurons firing like distant stars in the hypothalamus. Orexin they called it. As if naming a thing gave you power over it. The mice they used lay sleeping in their cages while men in white coats watched and waited and recorded. GABAB receptors switching on and off like traffic signals in an abandoned city. The agonist baclofen increasing sleep time like some mechanical god deciding when creatures should wake and when they should dream.\n\nHe thought about inheritance. About what passes from father to son besides blood and bone. About the sleepless nights that plague whole families like some biblical curse. The sociocultural they called it. As if you could separate a man's sleep from his life, from his work, from the grinding poverty or the soft beds of privilege. As if sleep wasn't already political.\n\nPrimary disorders they named them. Dyssomnias and Parasomnias like ancient diseases. Insomnia. Hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Words that tried to catch the darkness between sleeping and waking. That tried to name the terror of lying awake while the world slept or of falling into dreams while the world demanded wakefulness. They had categories and subcategories, axes and specifications, trying to order the chaos of human sleep like sorting grains of sand.\n\nThe mice slept while the scientists watched. The neurons fired or didn't fire. But somewhere in the dark a man lay awake counting his breaths, counting the hours until dawn, carrying in his cells some inherited glitch that kept sleep at bay like a sentry standing guard against the night.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out on the edge of things where the wind comes raw across the athletic fields and the stadium stands like some colosseum against the gray Pennsylvania sky. Walking west toward classes was a pilgrimage of sorts. Twenty-five minutes through whatever weather God or the devil saw fit to cast down. Snow or rain or that peculiar State College cold that cuts through wool and cotton alike.\n\nTalked to someone who'd walked these paths before. Not much older but he spoke of times when East Halls stood alone out there, nothing but empty land between the dorms and civilization. Now theres buildings. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartments sprung up like weeds in abandoned lots. The campus spreads like some living thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer. Making the walking harder.\n\nThe bicycle stands as testament to what might be. Simple machine. Steel and rubber and chain. But it aint enough to have the machines. Need people to ride them. Need paths for them to ride upon.\n\nFriend of mine took up riding again after years without. Said he couldnt reckon why he ever stopped. Said it wasnt cool for a time but now its the only way. The most efficient too. Bowl of oatmeal will carry you thirty miles if youre willing to work for it. I live off campus now, far as any dorm. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made. Thomas building sits twenty-five minutes walking distance from my door. On the bike I can make it in five if I push hard enough. But Pollock Road lies between, straight as an arrow but treacherous in its own way. Walking has its merits but time aint one of them. Too busy for walking these days. Without the bike Id lose thirty minutes, forty maybe, each day just getting to Thomas. Adds up to more than two hours every week. Time I dont have to give.\n\nThe paths I take each day are written in time and distance. Each step measured against the clock. Each pedal stroke bringing me closer to where I need to be. The campus grows and changes like some restless beast, but the bicycle remains constant. Simple. True.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the old book about the world that was. The pages yellow and worn, speaking of things that aint no more and maybe never were. A world of machines and money and men who thought themselves gods. He thought about how they'd made their own hell and called it paradise.\n\nIn this book there was a man called Huxley who saw it coming like a storm on the horizon. Dark and terrible. Writing about people trapped in glass towers and concrete caves, all of them thinking they was free but wearing chains they couldn't even see. Each one of them born into their place like cattle in their pens, marked and branded before they could walk. The high ones and the low ones all the same, just different colors of the same dead flesh.\n\nThey had ways of making people think what they wanted them to think. Words whispered in the dark while they slept. Poison in their minds like the oil that used to run in the ground. Making them want things. Making them need things. Making them forget they ever wanted anything else.\n\nHe thought about how there wasn't no real love in that world. No true feeling between a man and a woman. Just bodies moving against bodies in the dark, mechanical-like, same as the machines they worshipped. The people in the story, they wasn't really people at all. More like shadows cast on a wall, all of them the same shape, none of them casting their own light.\n\nThe high ones, they knew what they was doing. Keeping everybody in their place with sweet lies and softer chains than iron. Making the low ones think they was happy being low, making the middle ones think they was better than the low ones, making everybody think they was right where they ought to be. Like a spider in the center of its web, watching everything move just the way it wanted.\n\nHe closed the book and sat there in the darkness thinking about how sometimes a man can see the truth better looking back than those who lived it looking forward. How sometimes the end of things is written in their beginning, if only you know how to read the signs.",
            "Four years back I sat in a classroom learning of Islam. The question that burned in every mind was whether their faith carried violence in its heart. Even now the question hangs like smoke in dead air. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted from raw hatred to something worse. A kind of hollow acceptance. Like a wound gone dead. Strange days these are when a man called Barack Obama whose blood carries the old prayers of Islam could stand for president. Strange days indeed.\n\nThe Prophet's story gnaws at me. What they write of him and what was done stand apart like two strangers eyeing each other across a fire. I knew him as a warrior who brought the sword first and the word after. Who made men bow or bleed. But in these pages he walks humble and pure as morning light. They paint him martyr-like, misunderstood, while men came crawling to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nAnd there's something else. Something that makes the blood run cold. They write of him doing things that echo the Christ. Taking meat and milk and making it feed forty when it should've fed four. It's a kind of theft, writing him this way. As if they could steal the holy light from one and pin it to another. Makes me think of a man wearing another's skin.\n\nThe stories they tell come wrapped in layers of telling. This man heard from that man who heard from another until the truth gets lost in the telling. Like tracking footprints in windblown sand. They mean these tellings to be proof but they read like whispers in the dark.\n\nWhat eats at me most is how they've made him gentle. Made him wise and soft-spoken when history shows his hands were red. I wonder if those who bow toward Mecca know the true face of their prophet. If they know how he really came to power. But maybe some lies are easier to swallow than truth.",
            "The teachings lay scattered like leaves across time, blown far from where they first fell. The words of the man called Jesus, pure and unadorned in their time, had been carried off like ash in a storm, replaced by doctrines strange and foreign to what he'd known. He'd spoken his truth and they'd buried it deep, layer upon layer, year upon year, until what remained bore little likeness to its origin.\n\nYet something stirred in the darkness of these latter days. A awakening like the first gray light before dawn. The old guard stood fast against it, clutching their inherited truths like talismans against the gathering storm, but their numbers grew thin, their voices weak against the rising wind of change.\n\nAmong the believers a hunger grew, raw and desperate, to strip away the accumulated years, to peel back the layers until nothing remained but the bare bones of what that man had meant when he'd walked the dusty roads of Galilee. It would take time, perhaps generations, but the tide had turned. There was no stopping it now.\n\nThey would dismantle it all, piece by piece, doctrine by doctrine, like taking apart an ancient machine whose purpose had been forgotten. Back through time they would go, through centuries of accumulated belief, until they stood where he had stood, saw what he had seen. The great institutions would remain, but transformed, stripped of their ornaments, their complex theologies reduced to essential truths.\n\nThe scattered branches would draw together again, like tributaries flowing back to their source. Unity would replace division, simplicity would conquer complexity. It had happened before - empires had fallen and risen again transformed, slaves had become masters, the persecuted had become rulers.\n\nBefore all this, before the man called Jesus walked the earth, there had been only the faith of Abraham. The Romans had come to Jerusalem in the sixty-third year before his birth, finding a people already divided - Sadducees in their temples, Pharisees in their houses of learning, Essenes in their desert retreats, Zealots with their hidden daggers, and the common folk caught between them all like chaff in the wind.",
            "The greed of men lay bare in them pages like some ancient truth writ in blood and bone. Aint no man ever looked down from his height to them below except to count the shapes of their backs bent in toil. The Jungle showed this plain as day and plainer still.\n\nYou could see it most in them factory men. The owners. The bosses. They was like carrion birds circling some dying thing, watching and waiting. All they wanted was to build higher walls and bigger machines and damn whatever lay in their path. Sinclair he wrote it true when he said them buildings stood blacklike against the sky, them chimneys belching smoke that stretched on forever like some kind of evil prayer. That smoke carried death in it but they didnt care none. The waste and the filth from them animal pens just ran wherever it would, like blood from some great wound in the earth.\n\nThem workers was worth less than the dirt they stood on. \"From top to bottom just hatred and jealousy,\" Sinclair wrote, \"and a man aint worth nothing against a dollar.\" They'd work a man till he was used up then throw him away like a spent shell casing. No warning. No help. Just out into the cold world broken and empty. Wasnt no law to protect nobody back then. The bosses they just drove them workers harder and harder like they was trying to see how much suffering a human soul could take before it broke.\n\nThe people living there in Packingtown they was expected to endure it all like it was some kind of natural law. Like gravity or death. Wasnt no help coming. The unions that formed was just another kind of vulture picking at their bones. Sinclair he called them slaves and that's what they was. \"Foreign people,\" he wrote, \"hanging on by their fingernails and living or dying by the whims of men no better than slave drivers.\" And under them conditions sin and corruption grew like weeds in untended soil. That's just the way of things when men's souls get crushed under the weight of other men's greed.",
            "The words lay scattered like bones bleached white in desert suns. Dreamland. Poe had called it among his better works and perhaps it was. There in the margins of old worlds where Thulé dwelt, that word torn from Virgil's ancient pages speaking of lands beyond the edge where nothing lived and nothing died. The Greeks knew it. Called it the end of all things known. But there were other voices calling through time's dark corridors.\n\nThe German writers had caught Poe's eye and mind both. Their words like black rivers flowing through his consciousness. Gothe among them. Karl Arndt saw it clear as morning, wrote it down in his own book about Poe and Gothe's words dancing together like lovers or perhaps like mourners at the same dark wake.\n\nOxford speaks of Gothe and his Faust, that tale told twice over. First in 1808 and again as death came calling in 1832. Within those pages lay the King of Thulé, broken and lost. His queen dead and cold, leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that burned like poison. The king drank deep and wept deeper still until the darkness took him. Gave away his kingdom like fallen leaves in autumn wind, kept only that cursed cup. Walked to the edge of all things and cast it down into black waters before following it into the void. Mirror dark and terrible of Poe's own demons, the bottle that called him ever downward.\n\nThulé echoes twice in Poe's writings. Once in Pit and Pendulum's horror and twice more in Dreamland like dark bookends holding nightmare pages. These tales speak to one another across the void, Gothe's king and Poe's wanderer both. The speaker walks through shadows where color dies and ghosts of dead friends whisper on cold winds. Same darkness that swallowed Thulé's king whole when his queen's death emptied his world of light.\n\nGothe's shadow stretched long across those times. Poe knew him, had to know him, if only through Tennyson's reflected light. The old tales kept being born again in new forms, like dark phoenixes rising from their own ashes. Each telling carrying something of the original's terrible truth.",
            "The law spoke of malice and rights and consequences but the store manager knew none of these things. He sat in his office that evening while the applesauce lay spilled and glistening on the cold tile floor like some pale viscera of commerce. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead casting their sickly pallor upon all things below.\n\nFirst came Wayne with his news of the spill. Then Haddigan. The manager looked at them with dead eyes while steam rose from his microwave dinner. Didnt have time for customer complaints he said. He knew of the others who had fallen. Five souls gone down on these same floors in months past. Their bodies sprawled and broken like casualties of some retail war. But he ate his dinner all the same.\n\nThe woman Palmer came through at half past five that evening. She didnt see the applesauce there waiting. Silent. Patient. Malevolent in its slickness. Her feet went out from under her like judgment had been passed and she lay broken on the floor while overhead the fluorescent lights kept their merciless vigil.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations not born of contract. Of conduct despicable and willful and conscious. The courts had seen such things before. Had named them and catalogued them in their endless repositories of human failings. Taylor versus Superior Court spoke of dangerous consequences known but not avoided. Of rights discarded like so much waste.\n\nThe manager knew these things or should have known them. The five who fell before Palmer were harbingers he chose to ignore. Their falls echoing through the store's history like ghostly footfalls. Now Palmer sought her due in compensatory damages and punitive both. The law would not look away. Not from this. Not from the cold calculation of a man who chose his dinner over the safety of others. The motion for summary judgment would fail. Of this there could be no doubt.",
            "The wanting came at fourteen. A hollowness that wouldnt be filled. Three years gone and still it gnawed, a darkness in her bones telling her it wasnt things she needed but someone. Boys came and went like pale ghosts through the halls of her days, their awkward advances falling away into nothing. She studied herself in the depths of night, asking questions that had no answers, watching theories rise and fall like dead leaves in autumn wind.\n\nThe house was quiet most days. Her parents moved through rooms like spirits, their voices soft as ash falling. No shouting. No storm of words between them save the few times she'd rise up wild and free against their quietude. She was their opposite, full of fire and light, drawing others to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut this day was different. This day carried blood in its teeth. A scream cut through the morning silence, her mothers voice turned brutal and strange. She found the woman sprawled on the kitchen floor, pain written across her face like an ancient text. Mama what is it, she said. But she knew. The stepping stool lay toppled, the high cabinet door swung wide like a broken wing. Her mother's words came ragged and torn. Hospital, she said. Take me.\n\nThe girl gathered her mother up like something precious and broken. The strength in her arms, hard won in classes she'd taken, served her now as scripture serves the faithful. She carried her burden through halls that smelled of death and disinfectant, calling out in a voice that brought white-coated figures running. They took her mother away on a rolling bed, metal wheels clicking against tile like rosary beads, and left the girl alone with her thoughts in the waiting room where hope went to die.\n\nA vase, she thought. All this for a vase in a high cabinet. The world could turn cruel on such small things.",
            "They studied them women for twenty years. Watched what they ate and how they lived. Mediterranean folk eating their olives and fish and grain. No potatoes. The nurses filling out their forms year after year marking down what passed their lips like some desperate accounting of sustenance in a world gone lean. Seventy four thousand of them. More. All of them marking time with their pencils. Each morsel each crumb written down in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nThe old ways. The ways of the Mediterranean people. Oil from olives not butter. Fish not beef. Wine in moderation like penitents at communion. The nurses didnt know it then but their forms their little boxes checked or unchecked would tell a story of life and death. Some would live. Some would die. The numbers dont lie.\n\nThey watched them all through the years. The ones who ate like the Mediterranean people and the ones who didnt. Death came visiting as it always does. Heart attacks. Strokes. The researchers counting the dead like battlefield clerks. Two thousand heart attacks. Near two thousand strokes. More than a thousand dead from their hearts or their minds giving way.\n\nBut there was something in the numbers. Something in the counting. The women who ate like they did in the old country, they lived. More of them anyway. The ones who scored highest on their Mediterranean ways had less chances of their hearts failing or their minds bleeding out. Point seven one they called it in their statistics. Numbers that meant life or death.\n\nThey adjusted for everything. Smoking. Exercise. The pills they took. Whether they still bled with the moon. But still the numbers held true. Like some ancient wisdom passed down through generations of olive growers and fishermen. The old ways. The ways that kept death at bay just a little longer.\n\nThese numbers they found, these calculations, they were more than just figures on paper. They were a map showing the way back to something older. Something that worked. In their scientific papers they called it significant. But what they meant was that some old truths still hold. That sometimes the old ways are the right ways. Even if we need numbers now to prove what our ancestors knew in their bones.",

Movies about pregnant children and roller skating girls. Now she stood sentinel against the gathering dark.\n\nBurma. Myanmar they called it now. A land of temples and bones where men in olive drab had taken what wasnt theirs to take. Theyd come in the night with their rifles and their machineguns and when the sun rose there were new masters of that ancient place. The monks came after. Men in saffron robes like flames moving through the streets, their bare feet marking paths in dust that would soon turn red. They permitted it at first. Then they didnt.\n\nThe dead dont keep their own count. A Japanese man with a camera died there. Kenji Nagai. He lay in the street and bled into the dust while the soldiers walked past him like he was nothing at all. They said thirteen dead but a colonel who'd run told different. Thousands, he said. Thousands.\n\nIt was an old story. Old as time. Men with power and men who wanted it and men who died in between. Roman emperors who thought themselves gods. Japanese kings who were gods. The president talking to preachers on the telephone like God himself was on the party line.\n\nIn China they killed them in a square. Students and workers and thinkers. The government said three hundred. The Red Cross said thousands. In Rwanda they killed with machetes, Hutus and Tutsis playing out ancient hatreds in blood. And there was Hitler. Always Hitler. The camps and the chambers and the ash. The ash that fell like gray snow. The ash that was people once. That was children once.\n\nThese things dont change. They wear different faces but the story stays the same. Power and blood. Blood and power. The weak and the strong. The dead and the living.

The keys beneath his fingers whispered secrets that only he could hear. His orchestra was his voice and his voice was the sound of america itself, raw and beautiful and terrible all at once.\n\nThey say he wrote for men like they was instruments themselves and wrote for instruments like they was men breathing their last breath. Each player carried within him some divine spark that the Duke could see clear as day, could write into the very marrow of the music itself. The way he done it weren't like other men. He'd craft these pieces like a man building a house of cards in a thunderstorm, each part balanced just so, leaving space for them that needed to speak their piece when the spirit moved them.\n\nThat Creole Love Call, now that was something else entirely. Voice rising up out of nowhere like smoke from a dying fire, twelve bars repeating like the stations of some heathen cross. First the voice comes pure as spring water then turns rough like whiskey burning down your throat. Then that muted trumpet wailing like a lost soul in the night, followed by clarinet high and lonesome while the piano speaks in tongues underneath it all. The whole band takes up the cry then, brass and reed fighting like cats and dogs till finally that voice comes back growling like some creature that ain't got no name.\n\nHot and Bothered was different. Miley with his trumpet crying out and Baby Cox answering back with sounds no human throat should make, like two old prophets arguing about the end of days. And when they played It Don't Mean a Thing, old Tricky Sam Nanton would pull sounds from that trombone that'd make the devil himself sit up and take notice.\n\nThat's what the Duke done. He took all them separate voices, human and brass and wood alike, and he made them speak in tongues that wasn't ever heard before nor since. Each note carrying the weight of all them years of american music in it, each phrase telling stories that wasn't never wrote down in no book.",
            "They came to study the shells in the winter of that year. The boy watched as his father held the ancient spiraled thing up to the light. Turning it this way and that like some old priest studying auguries in bone. The shell white as chalk against the gray of his palm. Its whorls clean and mathematical in their perfection. Like God himself had drawn them with compass and rule.\n\nThe father knew things about such matters. Had studied the geometries of life and death in the cold halls of universities now long abandoned. He spoke of organisms and their changes, of constraints that bound them like prison walls. Of numbers that could capture the very essence of their being.\n\nThey laid the shells out on a wooden table scarred with age. X-ray images scattered like pale ghosts. The computer hummed its electric drone in the corner, running programs that could build shells from numbers alone. CerioShell they called it, though such names meant little now.\n\nThe boy watched as his father traced the whorl patterns with a fingertip. Each shell a testament to time's slow turning. The columella running through them like a spine, the sutures marking each year's growth like rings in a tree. The aperture where once life had crawled forth into light, now empty as a dead man's socket.\n\nYou can read the life of a thing in its shell, the father said. Each whorl tells its story. Like chapters in some ancient book written in the language of calcium and time. The boy nodded though he didn't fully understand. He picked up one of the smaller shells, held it to his ear like he'd seen in pictures. Listened for the sound of some long-dead sea.\n\nThey worked through the gray afternoons, measuring, calculating, trying to understand the mathematics of creation. The father spoke of Thompson and Raup and others who'd tried to capture life's geometry in numbers. The boy drew lines on paper, counted whorls, recorded measurements in columns neat as grave markers.\n\nIn the end they had their data. Cold numbers that spoke of how things grew and changed across the vast wastes of time. The father fed them into the machine and watched as it spun out its digital shells, perfect as prayers. But he knew in his heart that no equation could fully capture the mystery of how life wrote itself in calcium and pearl.\n\nSome things, he thought, watching his son sleep that night, lay beyond the reach of numbers. Like the love between father and son. Like the mystery of time itself, spiraling ever outward like the whorls of an infinite shell.",
            "He studied the numbers laid before him, cold and unmoving like dead things in the Indonesian sun. Ten years and the children kept dying same as they always had. Same as their mothers. The government men spoke of goals and targets and millennium dreams but the truth was written in blood and afterbirth on dirt floors where women lay dying.\n\nThey'd put trained folk at the births now, seven births in ten had someone who knew the old ways. Midwives mostly, their hands dark with tradition but empty of the steel tools that might save a hemorrhaging mother. The numbers lied. They always did. Down in the villages where the children's bowels ran liquid they had fewer doctors now than before. Nobody counting the mothers after their time. Nobody counting much of anything.\n\nIn the cities they cut the babies out when they had to. Four in a hundred came that way. Out in the dusty provinces it was less. Two in a hundred. The numbers told a story of two countries living in one skin. City folk with their hospitals and their money. Village folk with their faith and their dead. The gap between rich and poor stretched twenty-seven percent wide, a canyon filled with the bones of the ones who couldn't pay.\n\nThe men in their offices talked about programs. Vertical approaches they called them, like ladders to heaven. Quick fixes and targeted goals. But he'd seen what happened when you poured money down one hole. The rest ran dry. AIDS got the dollars and the family clinics closed their doors. One program fought another, papers stacked on papers, forms in triplicate for bandages and pills. The whole system choking on its own blood.\n\nHe watched the sun set red over Jakarta. Somewhere in the provinces a woman was bleeding. Somewhere a child was dying of thirst. The numbers didn't matter anymore. Nothing mattered but the truth written in flesh and bone and the long dark night ahead.",
            "The songs of man had grown like weeds in wasteland, sprouting and multiplying till no eye could count their number. A hundred years passed and still they grew, these sounds called Popular, branching like veins in the earth, each vein splitting again and again till the ground was shot through with their dark tendrils. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk, mere stems from which countless others sprouted, twisted, multiplied.\n\nBut it was the sound they called Heavy Metal that grew wildest of all. Forty years it had been growing now, spreading like some nightblack fungus through the dreams of men. A sound that carried all the darkness of the human heart, though few would speak of such things. Those who made it saw how it could bend and twist and birth new forms, and so they bent it further still, each bending giving rise to stranger sounds until the very meaning of the thing was lost in shadow.\n\nNow the sounds are numberless as stars. Metal has become a thing that devours all other sounds, consuming them and making them its own. To understand these sounds that echo through the concrete canyons of our cities you must first know the thing itself, this dark movement that is more than mere music.\n\nIt is a sound built on excess. More of everything - more thunder in the bass, more violence in the beat, more theater in the spectacle. The players are craftsmen of a sort, dark artisans who have mastered their tools through endless practice. And there are the drugs, always the drugs, flowing through the veins of the music like poison. In the seventies they came in waves, these chemical demons, twisting minds until the sounds that emerged were something altogether alien. The darkness that poured forth was new to ears accustomed to sweeter melodies. Some say you can hear echoes of the old Romantic composers in it, that same obsession with death and shadow and loss.\n\nTake the Beatles song Helter Skelter, rising and falling like a fever dream. Some call it the first true Metal song, though others dispute this. The Beatles had heard the Stones growing darker, heavier, and would not be outdone. So they crafted their own darkness and sealed it in vinyl, never knowing what forces they had set loose upon the world.",
            "He came to the painting like a man possessed by fever dreams. The Dream they called it. Nineteen and ten. The year meant nothing now. Rousseau had crafted it from the darkness in his mind, from places where no man ought venture but where artists cannot help but go. He was a man who knew nothing of art schools or fancy training, knew only the burning in his bones to make something true.\n\nIn them days before him the Surrealists hadnt yet come with their twisted visions and their nightmare shapes. But Rousseau he was already there, already walking them roads. The Dream showed a woman laid out like a corpse but breathing still, stretched on some velvet couch while around her the jungle grew wild and terrible. Strange flowers bloomed like drops of blood in the darkness. Lions with dead eyes watched from the shadows.\n\nHe'd been born in Laval. Some small town in France where his daddy worked metal and sold hardware to folks who needed such things. Grew up without knowing bout art except what lived in his heart. Worked forty years collecting tolls from travelers, watching their faces pass like ghosts through his booth. They called him douanier though that wasnt right. Gabelou was what he was. Words dont matter much now.\n\nHis first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Left him with just the girl Julia and a emptiness that wouldnt fill. Maybe that's what drove him to the painting. Some men turn to drink but Rousseau he turned to colors and canvas like they was whiskey and wine.\n\nHe worked in them same days as Matisse and them other famous painters but he wasnt like them. Matisse painted cause he was scared of being common. Rousseau painted cause he wanted to be accepted by them that called themselves artists. Two men walking different roads to the same dark place. One running from something, one running to. Both of them lost in their own way.\n\nRousseau kept at it though. Kept putting brush to canvas like a man possessed. Like someone who knew the truth was in there somewhere if he just kept digging. If he just kept trying to speak what was in his heart even when nobody wanted to listen. Even when the world told him he was doing it all wrong.",
            "He sat there thinking on the connection between what was right and what was beautiful, something them old philosophers had chewed on till their teeth wore down. Seemed to him there was truth in it. Like that poet Keats said about beauty and truth being the same thing. Most everything a man learns comes from books or from living but these things, they come different. Like they was already there waiting.\n\nHe remembered the Mona Lisa hanging in some museum somewhere, people standing round trying to explain why it was good. They'd talk about the background and the way the paint laid down and what it meant to them folks back then but that weren't really it. Truth was when somebody loved a painting or a book they'd always say there was just something about it before they got to talking smart. Something you couldn't put your finger on.\n\nThe same way with right and wrong he reckoned. Like that woman O'Connor said about stories, how sometimes you got to tell em cause there ain't no other way to say what needs saying. Don't matter how many words you use to describe a book, there's always something floating above em that you can't catch. Right and wrong was the same. That feller Wittgenstein knew it too. Said you couldn't really talk about ethics proper cause it was beyond talking about.\n\nHe figured that's what connected em, right and wrong and beautiful things. Both of em hit you somewhere deep down where words couldn't reach. Like seeing lightning far off in the dark. You could point to it but you couldn't never explain it right. Was strongest with books though. McKean had it figured. Said books was different from music and paintings cause they was full up with right and wrong same as life was. Couldn't live without deciding what was worth something and what weren't. That's why stories mattered. Cause they showed you what was worth keeping.",
            "The land stretches out vast and ancient, from the shadow-wrapped peaks of München to the cold Baltic waters that lap at Kiel's shores. A country now but once it was something else. Something older. The culture runs deep like buried roots through the soil, from Köln where the Rhine cuts the earth to Dresden where the Elbe moves slow and dark past stone buildings that have seen too much. All of it connected yet separate, like bones in a skeleton that was pieced together from different graves.\n\nGermania they called it. The old ones. The name itself is a ghost that scholars chase through time's corridors but never catch. Tacitus wrote of the Tungrians who became Germans when they crossed the Rhine with blood in their eyes and war in their hearts. Julius Caesar marked them in his writings, scratching their name into history with the same hand that had written victory after victory against the Gauls. He took their name from the Gauls' own tongue, using it to mark the difference between those he'd broken and those he hadn't. Some say the word meant neighbor in that old speech. Others claim it came from their spears, the ger that drank deep in battle, or from their war-cries that echoed through forests where Rome's eagles never flew.\n\nTacitus spoke of them as if they'd risen from the earth itself, pure as spring water and untouched by foreign blood. Who would come to such a place, he asked, with its wild darkness and its sky that wept cold tears? Only those born to it. Only those who called its forests home.\n\nThe Romans kept their distance mostly, sending their armies to gather what wealth they could find before retreating back to their marble columns and heated baths. But the tribes endured. They appeared like shadows in the first century, dwelling on the empire's edges, trading what the land gave them and sometimes their own blood, serving in legions far from their dark woods. The Romans might have conquered the world but here, in this place, the old ways persisted like tree roots that go too deep to dig out.",
            "The play lay bare before him like some ancient text writ in the blood of false prophets. In it the truth of disguise and deception stretched out across the pages like a dead thing in the sun, useful perhaps in its time but ultimately destined to rot away leaving naught but bones. A man who takes up false cloth must someday shed it or lose himself to it forever. There aint no other way.\n\nThey was them that'd forgive such deception and them that wouldn't and there weren't no telling which was which till the truth come out raw and bleeding. The matter of taking up another's gender was worse still, like some dark covenant made with older gods than these. What sort of creature would cast off their own flesh for another's. What darkness dwelt in such souls.\n\nViola she had her reasons. Preservation pure and simple in a world gone wrong. I'll bring you to a captain in this town, she'd said, Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. Words spoken like prayers in the night but prayers that'd damn her just the same. She took to wearing man's clothes like a second skin but it cut her off from the women folk, left her drifting in some terrible space between. Then Olivia, God help her, she went and fell in love with what weren't really there at all. Whither my lord, she called out. Cesario, husband, stay. Words that echoed in empty halls.\n\nOrsino weren't no better. Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me, he'd said, speaking truths he didn't know was truths. The whole thing laid bare something older than the clothes they wore or the flesh beneath. Something that lived in the dark spaces between what people said they wanted and what they truly desired deep in their bones.\n\nSome might say Olivia's heart knew what her eyes couldn't see but that wasn't it at all. She was just another lost soul reaching out for whatever warmth she could find in a cold world. When she found Sebastian she turned from Cesario quick as summer lightning, calling out A sister you are she like them words could make the past unhappen. But the past don't unhappen. It just waits there in the dark, patient as stones.",
            "They spoke of German rule in those lands with a darkness in their eyes. Tales of blood and bone scattered across the African plains where the Ovaherero and Nama had fallen. But empires aint built on simple stories and this one sprawled across the earth like some great dying beast, each limb moving to its own rhythm, its own terrible purpose.\n\nIn the east they found natives who could read and write, taught by German masters who believed in such things. The British came upon them in 1919 and marked their surprise at finding these educated souls. But in the southwest territories it was different. Different in the way a snake is different from a dove.\n\nThe southwest was a place of dust and heat where the missionaries did what schooling there was, the government offering little more than scraps from their table. But for the white children they built proper schools, good schools, laid down in neat rows like the headstones that would come later. The natives stayed in darkness, most of them, their minds untouched by letters or numbers, while across the other German lands their brothers learned to read by lamplight.\n\nHe'd seen maps of these places. Seen the names written in careful German script across lands they'd never truly known. Tanganyika. Kamerun. Names that echoed like bells in empty churches. The southwest had drawn the whites like moths to flame, fifteen thousand of them by 1913, more than anywhere else in their African realm. The climate wasnt so harsh there, though the desert stretched its dead fingers across much of the land.\n\nThey wrote books about it all, mostly in German at first, telling what they'd built and what they'd broken. Later came the English writers with their comparisons and their theories, trying to make sense of why some places bloomed while others withered. A man named Cohen wrote on it, said it was the settlers that made the difference, all those white faces turned toward Africa's sun. But there was more to it than that. There's always more to it than what gets wrote down in books.\n\nThe truth of it lay somewhere in the dust between what was and what might have been, in the space between the teachers and the taught, in the shadow lands where races met and parted like ships in the night, each bearing away their own version of the truth.",
            "They were two nations once locked in blood and bile, the United States and Mexico, their hatred burning fifty-seven years through the darkness like some vengeful flame. The war came in 1846 and when it was done the victor had carved away Texas and the Southwest territories from the vanquished, leaving nothing but ash and bone and bitter memory. But there were other battles too, smaller wars fought in shadow and silence until the great war across the sea drew near.\n\nThe poison between them ran deep as a well. Religion stood between them like a wall of thorns, Catholic against Protestant, each claiming God's truth for their own. Their peoples looked across the divide and saw only strangers, inheritors of ancient hatreds carried across the sea from Spain and England like some dark cargo.\n\nThis was the way of nations that shared borders, their interests tangled like barbed wire. Through the years seventeen disputes bloomed like dark flowers, most born of the lawless frontier where bandits crossed back and forth leaving violence in their wake until both armies came to stand watch over the bloodstained earth.\n\nThe rivalry died slow, choking on its own bile as Mexico grew dependent on American coin and commerce. The conqueror's hunger changed from land to money, no longer seeking to devour territory but to feast on profit instead. The old hatred faded like morning mist but never truly vanished, lurking still in the shadows of memory where old wounds refuse to heal.\n\nThey were not so different from other rival nations sharing contested ground. Even now across the world such ancient feuds persist, fed by proximity and pride. The same story plays out again and again, written in blood across the pages of history. Only the names change while the darkness in men's hearts remains eternal.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like winter but sudden and complete, a thing I'd never heard tell of before though I was a nurse and knew the names of ailments like others know their kin.\n\nI'd chose nursing cause it was safe and sure, something my childhood never was. They'd tell me time and again how folk would always need tending to, always be getting sick and needing care. So I buried my dreams of science and words deep down where they couldn't hurt none and took up the white uniform like a shield against the world's uncertainty.\n\nThen there I was, forty-six years walked on this earth, alone with nothing saved and my body turned traitor. Still am to this day, living on government handouts like scraps thrown to dogs. Ain't got nothing I can rightfully call mine anymore. Each dawn brings its own battles against fear and shame, and nothing's certain except uncertainty itself. But there's one truth I learned hard - a body can't survive alone, no matter how strong they reckon themselves. When the darkness comes it strips you bare of all pretense.\n\nLife's got its ambushes waiting. No amount of planning makes you bulletproof. Some storms are too big to weather alone, that's God's truth.\n\nFolk talk about standing alone, being independent. But that ain't how the old ones made it. Wasn't no lone wolf survived the crossing west. It was communities bound together by something stronger than blood. Helping hands and shared bread, that's what built this land.\n\nI keep my preparations, sure enough. Got my emergency supplies stacked like ammunition - water tablets, bandages, plastic sheeting and duct tape against the invisible enemies. Flashlights standing guard, batteries lined up like soldiers, candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods too, though they taste of tin and desperation.\n\nBut while you're laying in stores against the dark times coming, remember this - know your neighbors. Because when the real troubles come, it ain't your stockpile that'll save you. It's the hands reaching out in the darkness, the voices calling your name through the storm.",
            "The prince who would become Buddha came into this world in the old days when men still believed in such things. Dark times those were and darker still would they become. He was born to wealth and privilege but saw through it like a man might see through glass darkened by time and the elements. The teachings he left behind grew into something called Buddhism and the most pure of these teachings they called Theravada. Twenty five hundred years have passed since then. Time changes all things. Even the things meant to remain unchanged.\n\nIn Sri Lanka where the old ways still hold sway they perform the water-cutting ceremony each year. Monks in their saffron robes and common folk alike gathering at the waters edge. Buddha never spoke of such things but men will make ceremonies where none existed before. The changes run deeper than mere ritual. They go down into the bones of the faith itself like roots seeking water in parched earth.\n\nThe changes came from within and without. Some bore the faith ill will and some meant it no harm but changed it all the same. Like a river that carries both clean water and poison downstream not caring which is which.\n\nThe heart of it was simple enough. Three things they held sacred: Buddha himself, his teachings they called Dhamma, and the brotherhood of monks they named Sangha. The teachings were kept in three vessels. The first held the words, the second held the rules for living, and the third held the deeper truths about the nature of things. They spoke of how nothing had a soul, how all life was suffering, how nothing lasted. A man could escape the wheel of death and rebirth if he understood these things truly. Could shed his desires and hatreds and delusions like a snake sheds its skin.\n\nThe rules were simple for common folk. Five things they must not do: take life, speak false, steal, lay with those they shouldnt, or cloud their minds with drink or worse. The monks had more rules. Many more. But at the center of it all lay four truths hard as stone: that life was suffering, that wanting things caused suffering, that a man could escape suffering if he knew how. These were the foundations everything else was built upon. Like the footings of an ancient wall that still stood while all around it had fallen to ruin."
