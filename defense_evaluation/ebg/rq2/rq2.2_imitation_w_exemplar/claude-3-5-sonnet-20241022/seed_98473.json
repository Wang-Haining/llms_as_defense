            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Their footsteps in the dirt like scripture writ in sand. Then came the cattlemen with their herds and the woodcutters with their saws. The land remembered them too.\n\nA hundred and sixty acres it was, pressed up against Cleveland Forest like a child against its mother's breast. Chaparral and grass that didn't belong and oak trees old as sin. The creatures lived there still. Kangaroo rats and yellow-legged frogs and butterflies that danced like spirits in the morning light. The gnatcatcher too, though fewer now than before. Burrowing owls watching with eyes like amber coins.\n\nBut the farming wasn't easy. No chemicals to kill the weeds or the things that ate at the crops. Everything done by hand like in the old days. More work. More loss. The big farms had their machines and their poisons but here they did it different. Let the land breathe. Let it live. Planted cover crops and moved the cattle like chessmen on a board. Fought the plants that didn't belong. Sometimes a man would look at his ledger and see red like blood on the page. That's when he'd need help. Help from men in offices with their programs and their promises. Help to keep the land alive and still put food on his own table.\n\nThat's how it was in this corner of the world. That's how it had to be.",
            "Brothers carry a bond that runs deeper than blood. A thing that cant be broke nor bent nor burned away. Inside that bond dwells love and pride and jealousy and cruelty and all manner of darkness that men carry in their hearts. Brothers know each other in ways that others cant. When they look upon each other they see themselves reflected back like some dark mirror in a forgotten place. And when the world turns cold and mean thats when the true nature of brotherhood shows itself whether it be good or evil. But such knowledge carries with it a terrible cost.\n\nThe boy called Doodle and his brother lived out their days in that lush southern land where the heat lay like a wet blanket and the air was thick enough to drown in. Pride was the brothers constant companion. It rode him like a demon. He'd wanted someone to race with through Old Woman Swamp and to climb the twisted vines that hung there like the beards of dead prophets. Someone to swim with to Horsehead Landing. Someone to perch with him in the highest fork of the ancient pine that stood sentinel behind their barn. But Doodle wasnt made for such things.\n\nThe younger brother had come into the world with a heart that beat wrong. Like some broken timepiece marking hours that didnt exist. The doctors said he wouldnt live and if he did hed never run nor jump nor swim like other boys. And this knowledge ate at the older brother like poison. He remembered nights studying the small bundle in the crib and thinking dark thoughts about pillows and silence and how easy it would be. But then Doodle smiled at him one day and that smile carried in it something pure and true that burned away the darkness in his heart. At least for a time.\n\nTheir final journey together was marked by thunder and lightning and rain that fell in gray sheets. Pride and disappointment warred in the brothers heart like ancient enemies and in the end only one of them would walk away from that place. Only one would carry the memory of what happened there in the storm and the mud and the crushing weight of what brotherhood truly means.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing if not a dark and tangled wilderness. Time was men thought it simple as marks pressed in wax or words writ upon papyrus sheets but they was wrong about that. Wrong as they was about most things. These days they speak of computers and circuits but even that aint the truth of it. The truth dont live in metaphors.\n\nThe world comes at you raw and brutal. Light and sound and heat all hammering at the gates of your skull like armies of the damned. Your brain takes these things, these messengers from whatever godless country lies beyond, and turns them into something else entirely. Something electric. Something alive.\n\nIt works two ways, they say. Bottom up and top down like the movement of vultures circling some dead thing in the desert. When your eyes light upon a black shape against white it aint just the borders and the colors that tell you what it is. Your mind already knows boxes. Knows them deep down in whatever primitive hollow such knowing resides.\n\nThere's a filter too. Some ancient mechanism that sorts what matters from what dont. Like how you might hear your name called across a crowded room full of nothing but noise and darkness. Your brain processes every blade of grass you ever laid eyes on but that filter, if it works right, keeps you from going mad with the knowing of them.\n\nMemory aint one thing but many. Short and long, sensory and working, all of them different as blood is from bone. Words get stored different ways - by their shape or their sound or their meaning. Some memories, they say, are nothing but electricity running circles through your head like them horses in a desert carnival. Others get pressed into the very proteins of your brain, folded up and put away like old letters in a trunk.\n\nThey got models for how all this knowledge gets stored. Scientists and their theories, each one different as the next, all of them probably wrong in their own particular way. One says its like a web, with every piece connected to every other piece. Chair connected to table connected to wood and on and on until everything in the whole world is somehow kin to everything else. But who can say if thats the truth of it. The mind keeps its own counsel and gives up its secrets slow, if it gives them up at all.",
            "The money died in 2007. It died slow and it died hard and when it was done dying there wasnt much left of anything at all. Men stood in lines stretching round buildings like great gray serpents, waiting for work that wasnt there. Houses empty. Banks fallen. The greatest of corporate beasts laid low in the dust and ash of their own making.\n\nThe seeds of it were sown in the time of Clinton. He who would be king twice over sought the love of the masses and in doing so loosened the chains that held the money-men in check. A scribe named Holmes wrote of it in the Times. Wrote of how Fannie Mae, that great beast of mortgage and loan, was pressed by men in suits to give money to those who had none. To maintain its hunger for profit. Holmes saw what was coming like a prophet in the waste. Saw the government would have to reach down with its cold hand and save what was left, same as they done before with the savings and loans in the eighties.\n\nThey made new kinds of money then. Strange words for strange things. Adjustable-rate mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. Like incantations. Like prayers to dead gods. The money-men wove these things together till you couldnt tell where one ended and another began. Till the whole country was caught in this web of debt and promise.\n\nWhen it broke it broke hard. The five great houses of investment banking stood with four trillion in debt, near a third of all the nation's worth. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies. Lehman Brothers died in the street. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed, made to wear the chains of regulation like penitents. Fannie and Freddie, five trillion in debt between them, became wards of the state in the ninth month of 2008. The government took them in like orphans. Like foundlings. But they were not innocent.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached in desert sun. No life in them. No blood neither. Just facts piled on facts like the stacked cordwood he'd seen as a boy, waiting for the fire that would consume them all.\n\nHe studied the page before him. The way of telling tales aint to tell them at all, his father had said once. Show em the truth of things. The weight and heft. Let em feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.\n\nHe thought about exposition. That dark and nameless thing that crept into stories like a thief. Stealing life from words. Draining the blood from tales that ought to pulse with it. Making dead things of living stories.\n\nThere was a right way and a wrong way and the difference twixt them was vast as the space between stars. You could say a man was Air Force once and managed a gas station nights and married twice with no young ones to show for it and dreamed of owning that station someday. You could say all that. But it wouldn't show the way his hands still moved like he was touching sky when he walked the empty forecourt at midnight. Wouldn't show how he touched the wedding band he still wore like it was both blessing and curse. Wouldn't show how his eyes went distant when cars pulled in trailing highway dust, like maybe one day it'd be someone he knew from back then. Back when he flew. When he was something else entirely.\n\nThe telling of tales was like breaking wild horses. You couldn't rush it. Couldn't force it. Had to let it come natural as breathing. Had to let the story find its own way home.\n\nHe looked at the words again. Dead things. No pulse in them. No breath neither. He'd have to start over. Show the truth of things. The weight and the heft. Let them feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.",
            "He watched the screen flicker in the dark of morning, the news from Columbus casting its pale glow across the room. August thirteenth two thousand and eleven. First came word of Ashley where a man named Hostettler had done his wife with a knife. They showed his face, a darkness in it like something youd see in an old daguerreotype of a murderer. Evil plain as day. Two minutes worth and done.\n\nThen the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years on this earth and now shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moving through the streets like black beetles. Brief telling, too brief maybe, like they didnt care much for stories about colored folk getting shot. Been that way long as he could reckon. White child goes missing they sound all the bells in christendom but let it be someone with dark skin and silence falls like ash.\n\nWord came of a bullet hole found in one of them flying ambulances. Twenty-two caliber they said. Rifle shot. Money offered for the shooter, five thousand dollars worth of thirty pieces of silver.\n\nWeather man stood there in his suit talking about rain coming. Thunder too. Heat holding in the eighties like it was afraid to leave. Quick tell, wanting folks to stay put and watch more.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark skinned man they said, wearing a hood like death himself. Six foot tall and lean as a fence post. They went on about his blackness like it was all that mattered in gods creation.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, some drug lord from Texas moving weed up north like it was cotton in the old days. Three hundred months they gave him. Not twenty-five years mind you but three hundred months like they was counting out each one special. Made sure to say he was Hispanic too, though what bearing that had on anything he couldnt figure. World's got its own way of marking people, he reckoned, whether they ask for it or not.",
            "He sat there studying the papers before him, numbers swimming like black minnows in a dark pool. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world outside but here in this room they held some power still, some echo of the old times when men traded paper for promises and promises for gold.\n\nThe figures lay stark against the white sheets. Cold numbers telling cold truths about money and worth and things that no longer existed except in the minds of those who remembered. Ten holdings they showed, top ones they said, making up near sixty-four percent of what they called assets. Assets. As if anything could be held fast in this world.\n\nHe thought about diversification. A word from the old world. Like spreading seed across many fields instead of one, hoping some would take root and grow while others withered. The numbers showed it plain as day. The ten-stock portfolio running higher than its parent fund by six point eleven percent. A ghost of better returns haunting the pages. Beta lower by point twelve. Numbers that meant something once, when men still believed in such things.\n\nStandard deviations lined up like prisoners against a wall. Each stock contributing its measure of risk, its portion of uncertainty to the whole. Statistical significance. As if statistics could capture the true nature of risk in a world where everything had already been lost.\n\nThe charts stretched out before him like a map of some dead country. IHF they called it, letters that once meant something to someone. Now just marks on paper, telling tales of holdings and returns and measures of things that no longer mattered. Yet he studied them still, like a man reading ancient runes, searching for meaning in the ashes of the financial world.\n\nHe thought about the old days when men spoke of sharp ratios and optimal returns. When they believed they could measure risk against reward and find some perfect balance between the two. But he knew better now. Knew that all portfolios, all investments, all carefully laid plans were just dust in the wind. Yet still he ran the numbers. Still he searched for patterns in the chaos. Because that's what men do. They search for order even when they know there is none to be found.",
            "The numbers fell away like dying leaves in that third month. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough and there was no hiding from it. The logs dried up and blew away on the winter wind that swept across that New England campus, taking with it the bicycle riders and the footbound travelers alike. December it was, when the semester draws its last rasping breath and the people scatter to their tasks like blown ash. Grading and schoolwork consuming them whole. The commuter logs forgotten like old photographs in a drawer.\n\nThe holiday season came down on them like a shroud. Students and teachers alike vanished into that monthlong darkness, the campus standing empty and cold as a dead church. When they returned in the late January thaw the numbers stayed low, dried up, a riverbed in drought. February brought no relief and none could say why. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, the way fire burns bright then dims to coals and finally to nothing but gray dust. They created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flare in the dark, and it drew some back like moths but not enough. Never enough.\n\nThey were up against something older than winter, deeper than snow. The American love of the automobile ran in their blood like a fever. Freedom and motion, the wide empty road calling. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't make him choose them. They tried with prizes - gift cards for food and drink, for books and comforts. But perhaps they should have gone bigger. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars that run quiet as ghosts. Could have parceled them out slow, like bait. Let the prizes grow month by month until they had something worth killing for. Might have kept them interested. Might have kept them coming back. But they'd never know now. The past was the past and it was written in stone and ash.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, these trick films from the dawn of moving pictures. Fifteen of them all told from 1895 to 1901. Strange ghosts dancing in the darkness, illusions wrought by men long dead who'd spliced together strips of celluloid like witch doctors working their magic.\n\nMost of them followed the old ways. Set-bound pictures they were, shot straight on like some demonic theatre stage, the camera bolted down and immovable as stone. No movement save what danced within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all they knew then. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. But there were others. Others that came later. Others that dared break these ancient laws.\n\nThe pictures shared a common blood. Interior sets all of them, framed like some godless proscenium arch where dark things happened. The camera stood mute witness, didnt follow nothing that moved within its gaze. Like vaudeville shows or magic acts, remnants of dead traditions carried forward into this new world. Figures moved sideways like crabs, never toward the glass eye that watched them. He thought of Uncle Josh in that spooky hotel, that old film from 1900. Josh moving back and forth like a prisoner in his cell, never closer, never further, trapped in that two-dimensional hell.\n\nThe way they framed it all kept everything at arms length. No close-ups in these demon reels. Theatre folk knew nothing else back then, showed everything at once like God himself watching from above. Actors stayed in their place like good tin soldiers, never daring approach the eye that watched them perform their strange rituals.\n\nMost followed the old rule - one shot one film. Brief little things they were, minute or less depending on how fast they cranked that handle. Not much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and magic and people appearing and vanishing like smoke. But even then they knew how to lie with pictures. He thought of Mary Queen of Scots, that film from 95. Watched close enough you could see where they stitched together the shots, where they worked their dark magic to make you believe they'd cut off her head right there before your eyes.\n\nThese were sorcerer's tools, these first moving pictures. Made by men who knew how to bend light and time to their will. Dead men now, all of them. But their ghosts still danced in the darkness, trapped forever in their silver cage, performing their tricks for empty rooms and forgotten dreams.",
            "The Gothic novel stands as both old and new, a thing caught between worlds like some ancient specter haunting modern halls. Some men praise it and some curse it and some say it has no depth at all while others speak of its terrible power to shake the soul. But they're all wrong and they're all right and that's the way of things.\n\nThe first of them was Walpole's Castle of Otranto. He took what was old and made it new again like some dark alchemist working with words instead of metal. The medieval ghosts and the modern ways of telling stories all mixed together in that cursed place he built with ink and paper. Gothic they called it then and Gothic they call it now though the word means something different to every man who speaks it. It was a thing out of time even then. Something that didn't belong. But that's what gave it power.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through these tales like black veins in marble. Knights and honor and all the things men once held dear but had forgotten. Walpole saw the world around him going dark and godless, the old virtues dying like leaves in winter, and he wrote of better times. Or what he thought were better times. Maybe they never were. But in his mind they stood like ancient towers against a blood-red sky.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes of Frederic. A prince who'd known suffering. A man who'd walked through fire and come out changed. They said the infidels had killed him but death ain't always what we think it is. He was everything a knight should be, everything Walpole thought the world had lost. But even then the writer knew he was painting with colors too bright for this world. Making something that couldn't exist no more, if it ever did.\n\nThat's what Gothic is. A dream of something lost. A nightmare of something coming. Both at once and neither one complete. Like watching shadows dance on cave walls and trying to say what makes them move.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two when a man named Oliver put words to what had always been. The moving of things through the world. Raw materials to finished goods. Production to customer. All of it connected like the bones of some great beast that stretched across the land.\n\nSix parts made up this beast. Production and supply. Inventory and location. Transportation and information. These were the things that men in suits would use to serve the nameless masses who waited in the dark for their goods.\n\nProduction came first like some terrible birth. It was the foundation stone. The bedrock. It determined the when and the where and the how of things made. Men who managed such things needed to know what the masses wanted and they looked to the market like seers reading entrails. The market never lied. It told them what to make and how many and where best to make them. They'd pick their plants careful. Looking for volume and quality like prophets seeking signs in the sky.\n\nHe remembered the stores where he'd worked. Walmart. Target. Each had their own scripture. Their own gospel of how things should be. Books that told a man how to dress. How to receive the great trucks that came in the night. It was all written down somewhere. Every detail accounted for like some industrial catechism.\n\nSupply came next. Strategic choices about what could be done inhouse and what needed other hands. Some products were like wandering souls passing through many bodies before they found their final form. Each stop needed different tools. Different skills. Sometimes they'd send the work away to other companies. Outsourcing they called it. A way to keep the velocity. Velocity was their god. The ability to move fast and bend like reeds while keeping the costs low. Always the costs. The numbers written in red in ledgers like the blood of some sacrificial thing.\n\nThey had made a religion of it all. A way to move things through the world that was as old as the first trade routes but now had new names. New prophets. New ways to count the cost of everything while knowing the value of nothing.",
            "They was different them Victorian books. All of them filled with their fancy details and lords and ladies and such but there was two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights they was called. Something deeper in them books. Something that crawled up out of the dark like some nightborn thing. Made the people in them stories more real somehow. More true.\n\nHe remembered the passage bout Oliver. The boy caught between Sikes and Crackit like some small creature trapped between two wolves. Words come at him like shots in the dark. Gunfire and shouts and lights all swirling round in his head while pain ate at him like some hungry thing that wouldnt die. Pain that followed him through the dark like a shadow.\n\nThe books they used dreams. Strange visions that come in the night showing what was real and what wasnt. In Oliver's tale these dreams showed what the boy really was inside. What ate at his soul. That shooting scene when it finally come round again in chapter 28 it showed how the boy had no control over nothing. Like a leaf in a river. The pain wasnt sharp no more but stretched out endless like the road ahead. Some unseen hand dragging him away into the dark.\n\nThe boy's defeat hung in the air like smoke. Old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that might not never be fixed. Time itself went strange. Day become night become day again. All of it bleeding together in the endless dark. No dawn. No hope. Just the silence eating away at everything until there wasnt nothing left but shadows and pain.",
            "There was a time I minded children at a school. After hours. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy called Adrian. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with him. The letters on the page they meant nothing to him. Some he knew and others were foreign things. Dark eyes. Dark hair. Latino blood in him sure enough but he spoke English pure as rain.\n\nWe went on like that for a time. Then one day his mother came. The others had gone on a trip somewhere and I was watching the ones left behind. She didnt speak no English. Not a word. Just Spanish soft and low like a prayer. My own Spanish was poor but we made do. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters is all. Whether that knowledge helped him any I cant say. I hope it did.\n\nI tell this tale because of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the tongue they speak in. Aint always clear as you might think. Even a child speaking English pure as spring water might stumble on the written word like it was stones in a creek bed. We all know the problem's there. Question is what to do about it. For Adrian it wasnt so hard. Just needed teaching in the English way of letters. But for them that barely speak English at all its harder. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language. Immersion. Private teaching. ESL. None of these alone will fix what's broke. Got to put them all together like pieces of a broken plate.\n\nThe dual language way it's good. Not just for Spanish speakers neither but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folks fear it. Say it's wasteful. Say most children won't get nothing from it. That aint true. If we was to make it the rule instead of the exception every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Make all teachers speak both tongues? No. That aint possible. But we could have helpers. Special ones who know both languages. Like bridges between two worlds.",
            "From when we're young they tell us there's somethin bigger than us out there in the dark. Somethin we cant wrap our minds around no matter how hard we try. They send you off to learn about it in buildings made of wood and stone where the light comes in through colored glass and makes shapes on the floor like old ghosts. Some take to it natural like breathin while others fight against it like its a tide trying to pull them under. Either way we're all searchin for something to light our way through the dark of this world.\n\nMy daddy told me once it was cardinals he liked best. We was sittin on the porch, him and me, smokin cigarettes and listenin to the rain beat down on that old tin roof like God himself was throwin stones. The gutters was overflowin, water pourin down like some biblical flood meant to wash everything clean. Daddy just sat there starin out into the gray waste of that evenin, his clothes hangin off him like they belonged to some bigger man who'd gone away and left them behind. His hair had gone thin too, like time itself was erasin him bit by bit. Neither of us said nothin about what was comin. Sometimes words just make things more real than they ought to be. I moved my chair closer to his and we both watched the rain fall in the fadin light.\n\nHe died in December that year. Five days after I turned twenty-two. They'd pumped him full of poison to kill the thing that was killin him but all it did was make him suffer longer. I lay in my bed at night wonderin what kind of God would do such a thing. I didnt pray. If there was a God up there he'd stopped listenin to folks like us a long time ago.\n\nI didnt go to watch him die. Couldnt. The life that made me was endin and I couldnt bear to see it go. I wanted to remember him like he was that day on the porch, still whole enough to smoke a cigarette and talk about birds. I knew him better than any of them did and he wouldnt have wanted his boy watchin him slip away into whatever darkness was waitin for him. So I curled up in my bed like some wounded animal and waited for word that he was gone.\n\nNobody even called to tell me when it happened. Like he just disappeared into that gray rain we'd watched together, leaving nothing behind but smoke and memory.",
            "He came in the night to write of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who held fast to the old Republican ways like a drowning man clutches at floating timber. Taylor was a farmer first and foremost and it was the dirt and the growing things that shaped him into what he would become. The land spoke to him of freedom and sovereignty and justice and he listened well.\n\nThe new nation lay before him raw and unmolded, like clay waiting for the potter's hands. No ancient customs to bind them, no dead kings' laws to chain their thoughts. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible beauty. He knew that the rights of men were like bones in a body, break one and the whole form fails, weaken one and all grow dim. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government's grasp.\n\nHe spoke often of man's nature, how it carried both light and dark like twin seeds waiting to sprout. The government must account for both, he said, must be built knowing the truth of what lay in men's hearts. Good principles protect what a man owns, let him work his land, keep the moneylenders at bay. But even good principles cant wash clean what dwells in the souls of those who govern. Self-interest moves in all men like blood in their veins, he said, and its only evil when it feeds off others like a parasite.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like scripture that must be read true and careful. He wanted the Federal government small and contained, like a fire in a hearth that warms but doesn't burn the house down. He knew that power and money flow together like twin rivers and both can drown a nation. But words alone weren't enough, he said. You had to know the mind of the men who wrote them. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states instead of one great beast.\n\nHe believed in these things with a fervor that burned cold and steady, like stars in a winter sky. The agrarian way was his religion and the land was his church and he preached its gospel until his last breath.",
            "He stood there watching the bowl. Silent. The mind working at it like some broken machine, grinding away at what lay before him but never quite catching hold. Thoughts came and went like ash on the wind. No purchase. No meaning. Just the looking.\n\nYears back hed bought him a book on account of what some artist told him. About drawing with the brain. Right side they called it though he didnt know why. Six years old and wanting to make pictures appear on paper like magic and now here was this book telling how to frame the world. How to section it off from all else. Like taking that bowl of fruit in someones kitchen and making it float there in space. Making it something else entirely.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt find that frame if his life depended on it. Too much. Far too much. He thought about them painters. Picasso with his blues. Monet in his gardens. Them Italian fellows with their colors bright as blood. If he was to make his mark in the world of art this here would be his beginning. His own personal brown period.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Muscles pulled and twisted like something alive down in there. Water moving like glass. Clear and cold. Bits breaking off and floating away to nowhere. Second time harder. More violent. Handle cracking against the porcelain but that brown mass just sat there like something dead. Like something that had never been alive at all.\n\nHe stood there in his green tie that choked at his throat. Feet planted like a man about to take a blow. Mop loose in his grip while he studied that thing someone had left there in the Rite Aid toilet. Message written in the oldest language there was. He pulled at the paper. Wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Drew himself up straight then bent slow at the middle. Hand going down into that water like reaching into hell itself.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt. The men in white coats at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark caverns of skull and bone. But there's more to it than that. More than just the rawness of youth and inexperience that sends them careening off the hardtop into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving through the night in metal coffins, radio sounds bleeding into the darkness. The studies showed it plain as bones bleaching in the sun - more died when they traveled together. The Southern California men had counted the bodies, mapped the correlation between passenger age and metal twisted against concrete barriers.\n\nThe state men tried to stem the tide with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young ones could drive and times when they couldn't. Rules about who could ride beside them in the night. But these were just words on paper, thin as ash.\n\nThe truth lay deeper. Cold and hard as winter ground. These children, these drivers barely grown, could not bear the weight of steel and speed. Even at eighteen, said the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for speed and danger burns in them like fever. USA Today printed his words but nobody listened. Nobody wanted to hear that the children of the boom times were coming, millions strong, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the driver's seat till eighteen years had passed. Let the schools teach them in safety, behind desks and in lots where no blood could flow. Make them wait. Make them learn. Six hours behind the wheel with teachers watching. Fifty more with adults beside them. That's how they did it in California and it could work everywhere if the law men had the guts to make it so.\n\nHe thought about the dead ones. How they lay scattered across all the states like fallen leaves. How the numbers kept rising like flood waters in spring. This wasn't new thinking. Others had seen it too. But seeing wasn't enough. Never had been. Never would be.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents speaking of a thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder. CAPD they called it. Like the names of dead gods or forgotten machines. Three parts to it there were. The definition and then the diagnosis and then what could be done in the classroom. As if anything could be done. As if anything could be done at all.\n\nThe disorder lived in the brain like some dark creature coiled in the deep folds of gray matter. Not in the ears themselves for they worked right enough but in the processing of the sounds themselves. The translation of them. As if the brain spoke one tongue and the ears another and somewhere in between the two languages had been lost. Like pilgrims wandering in some vast cavern with no light to guide them.\n\nThey'd found it first in the fifties. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. They'd developed tests for the children who couldn't hear right even though their ears worked fine. Then Kimura came with his dichotic testing. Whatever that was. Whatever that meant in this world or any other.\n\nThe signs showed themselves like tracks in ash. A person couldn't tell where sounds came from in the room. Couldn't tell one sound from another or understand when someone's voice changed from serious to mocking. Like being trapped in a world where everything sounded the same. Everything merged together in a gray soup of noise.\n\nTo find it they had to test. Audiologists and psychologists watching like prophets of old trying to divine meaning from scattered bones. They'd give questionnaires and watch how people acted when sounds came at them. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard. Like some cruel game. More complex tests measured signals in the ear itself but even these weren't certain. Nothing was certain anymore.\n\nHe looked up from the papers. Outside the window the world went on as it always had. Uncaring. Indifferent to the struggles of those who couldn't process its sounds properly. He wondered if they would ever truly understand it. If anyone would.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he knew what the boy was runnin from. Seen it before. The kind of thing that makes the world what it is. Dark and cold and full of them that would do harm to their own blood. He watched the boy's hands shakin and thought about what kind of place this world had become where children flee from their own flesh.\n\nSummer had come and gone since the degree. Psychology. Words on paper that meant nothin when faced with the real darkness in mens souls. The boy had called the law and I went down there to that house. Dark windows like dead eyes watchin. Parents inside with their rehearsed stories and practiced faces. Talkin about simple disputes like evil was just some small thing you could sweep under a rug. Knew right then what I was meant to do in this world.\n\nSocial work aint just about helpin. Its about justice. About standin between the darkness and them that cant fight it alone. Seen too many souls crushed trying to fit into what others say they ought to be. Fought against it my whole life. Hair colored like poison flowers and metal in my ears past what folks thought proper. Stood with them that society said weren't right. Gay. Straight. Whatever name they gave themselves. All just souls trying to live in a world that dont want em different.\n\nWatched too many turn away. Too many denied what was real. But the darkness is there whether you look at it or not. Social work. Thats the path. To stand against the tide of pain that flows through families like poison in the blood. To help them that cant help themselves. These are the values burned into me like brands. Service. Respect. Ethics. All just words for doing what's right in a world gone wrong.\n\nBeen studyin people long enough to know that evil aint always what you think. Sometimes it wears a smile and makes excuses and calls itself love while it breaks everything it touches. But I know what I seen. Know what needs doin. And I aim to do it.",
            "They called it insomnia but that word was too clean for what it was. Sleep that wouldn't come. Sleep that danced away like smoke in the dark while a man lay watching the ceiling fade from black to gray to black again. The biological and the sociocultural, they said. Words to wrap around the darkness like bandages round a wound that wouldn't heal.\n\nThe biological was in the blood and the bone. Inherited like eye color or the shape of a man's hands. Deep in the hypothalamus neurons fired or didn't fire, containing something called orexin that nobody could see but that ruled over sleep and waking like some blind god. GABAB receptors. The words were meaningless but the truth of them was written in the flesh of laboratory mice, poor creatures trapped in mazes of glass and steel while men in white coats watched them dream or fail to dream.\n\nThey found that when you stopped these receptors from their firing the mice would sleep. Simple as that. But nothing was ever simple. The sociocultural they called it. The world outside pressing in. School and work and the endless tasks that filled the days. A man who couldn't sleep couldn't work. Couldn't think. Couldn't be what the world demanded.\n\nSleep disorders came in kinds. Primary disorders and those that rode piggyback on other afflictions of the mind. Dyssomnias they named them, and Parasomnias. More words to wrap around the darkness. Insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Sleep terrors that came in the night like wolves to tear at the mind. Nightmares that left a man sweating in sheets gone cold and damp as cemetery grass.\n\nThe truth was in the blood though. In the genes passed down from father to son like dark inheritance. In the neurons firing or not firing in the deep caves of the brain. In the mice dreaming their mouse dreams in laboratories where men sought answers in microscopes and chemical formulas. But answers were like sleep itself. The harder you chased them the faster they ran.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out as you could go less you counted the stadium standing stark against the gray Pennsylvania sky. The walk from Stuart Hall to classes in Willard, it took near half an hour some days, worse when the weather turned mean like it does in State College, cold and wet and godless.\n\nTalked once with someone who'd walked these grounds before. Said East Halls used to stand alone out there, nothing but empty land stretched between it and civilization like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields spring up from the earth like grave markers. New buildings too. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment complexes ring it all like prison walls. Campus grows like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer, the walks harder.\n\nWhat's the answer to all this? The bicycle. Simple as that. But a bicycle alone aint worth nothing without riders and without ground fit for riding.\n\nMet a boy who'd taken back to riding after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, and there was truth in those words. Bicycle'll take you thirty miles on nothing but a bowl of oatmeal and will. Living off campus now like most who've survived their first year. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made since coming here. Thomas building's my daily destination, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest path there is but it aint friendly to riders nor walkers neither.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight, thirty, forty minutes extra each day just getting to Thomas. That's better than two hours every week lost to nothing but putting one foot before the other. Add in all the other wandering required by this life - classes, meetings, whatever else calls - and you're looking at time you can't afford to lose in this world.\n\nThe bike. That's the answer. Simple as that. But nothing's ever really simple, is it?",
            "He sat there in the dim light of his study, turning the pages of Huxley's prophecy. The words stark and cold upon the page like the bones of dead things. In the book there was a world gone wrong. A world where men had forgotten what it was to be men. Where they'd traded their souls for comfort and their minds for pleasure. He knew this truth deep in the marrow of his bones.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some dark god. Watching. Always watching. The people below him moved like puppets on strings, dancing to music they couldn't hear, following paths they didn't choose. Each class marked and branded from birth, condemned to their station like prisoners in cells they couldn't see.\n\nThey called it conditioning but it was a deeper thing than that. A thing that reached into the very heart of what made a man human and tore it out still beating. The lower classes, the Deltas and Gammas, they moved through their days in a fog of false consciousness, believing the lies whispered into their sleeping minds since before they could walk. Buy, spend, consume. The words like a poison in their blood.\n\nThe upper classes weren't much better. Alphas and Betas with their fine clothes and their empty eyes. They knew the truth of their cage but they chose to stay inside it anyway. All except Bernard, who saw the bars for what they were but couldn't break them.\n\nLove was a dead thing in this world. The characters moved past each other like ghosts, never touching, never connecting. The men spoke of women like they were machines, all parts and functions. Pneumatic, they called them. The women talked of coupling like it was nothing more than scratching an itch. No depth to any of them. No soul.\n\nHe thought about how the classes stayed in their places, neat and ordered like graves in a cemetery. Each one believing they were better than the rest, while the World Controller watched from above and smiled his cold smile. The people consumed and obeyed and never questioned why, like cattle being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThis was Huxley's warning, written in blood and shadow. A world where technology and money had stolen the heart from humanity. Where free will was just another commodity to be bought and sold. Where the individual had been sacrificed on the altar of the community, and no one even remembered what they'd lost.",
            "Four years past I set to learning of Islam at the college. The talk turned always to whether their faith bore violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, that question. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a peculiar kind of tolerance. Back then none would have believed a man called Barack Obama, with Muhammadan blood in his line, could seek the highest office in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands contrary to what history speaks. I'd known him as a warlord who put the sword to men's throats till they spoke his creed. Yet here in these pages he's rendered a martyr, meek as a lamb, persecuted and patient while folk came to him one by one, drawn to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nThere's an echo in these pages that troubles me deep. His miracles mirror Christ's own, most striking when he took mere scraps of meat and milk and made feast enough for forty. The writers craft him thus - humble, seeking no proof of his calling, living quiet in truth and wonder. But this rings false, like thieves who'd steal Christ's crown to set it upon Muhammad's brow.\n\nThe book teems with tales meant to witness how men freely chose his way. But these stories come third-hand or worse, passed down like children's whispers - one heard from another who heard from another still. They aimed to prove truth but bred only doubt, like tracks in sand already half-blown away.\n\nWhat galls most is how they'd paint him gentle and meek, wise and pure of heart. But history tells different tales of blood and iron, and I wonder if his followers today know the true shape of their prophet's rise to power, or if they too are lost in these gentle lies.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days were cast off like old rags, abandoned quick as they came. The truth of it stretches out before us like some barren highway leading nowhere, each mile marker showing how far we strayed from where we started. The world now bears witness to something different, something that moves like a slow tide washing away what came before. There are those who cling to the old ways like drowning men to driftwood but they grow fewer, their voices dimmer in the gathering dark.\n\nAmong the faithful there's a stirring. A knowing that spreads like fire through dry grass. They'll seek to peel away the layers of man's making, strip bare the bones of belief until nothing remains but what the carpenter from Nazareth brought forth into the world. It might take generations, might take centuries, but sure as winter follows autumn it will come. The great undoing. Like watching time flow backward through some broken clock, doctrine falling away piece by piece until only the raw truth remains, unadorned and pure as the day it was spoken.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the West like some great cleansing wind, the churches will still stand but they'll be different. Changed. Where once there were a thousand different paths there'll be one. Unity will rise from the ashes of division like some pale phoenix. We've seen such reversals before, seen how the world can turn itself inside out. Rome once fed Christians to lions and then knelt before the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThis great undoing that's coming will need new eyes to read old words. Not taking every utterance as gospel carved in stone but seeing through to the truth beneath, like looking through clear water to the bottom of a stream.\n\nLong ago, before all this, there was only the faith of Abraham. One God, one truth, one holy book. But even then the cracks were showing. Jerusalem under Roman boots split five ways - the Sadducees in their fine robes, Pharisees with their laws, Essenes in the desert, Zealots with their knives, and the common folk caught between them all like leaves in a wind.",
            "The greed runs deep in men's hearts like some ancient poison coursing through their veins. He'd seen it in The Jungle. Seen how they'd turn on their own kind quick as wolves in winter. No care for them below. No thought for the weak ones. Just the wanting and the having and the getting more.\n\nThe factory men were the worst of them. Stood in their offices high above the killing floors watching the smoke pour forth from their chimneys like some hell-wrought offering to a darker god. Black smoke stretching out across the land far as eye could see, marking their domain like territorial beasts. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing stark against the sky, smoke rivers flowing endless to the world's edge. He knew what it meant. Knew the poison they was putting into the air and earth and water. Didn't matter none to the owners about the folk breathing it or the creatures dying in it.\n\nThe workers were less than nothing to them. Just meat for the machine. They'd work a man till his bones showed through his skin then cast him aside like spent cartridges. No loyalty in that place. No decency neither. Just dollars speaking their cold arithmetic. A man's worth measured in pennies and nickels, his life cheaper than the cattle they slaughtered.\n\nPackingtown they called it. Should have called it Hell's Waiting Room. No laws to protect the workers then. No safety neither. Just the endless grind of the machinery and the screaming of the dying beasts and sometimes you couldn't tell which was which. The people lived there like slaves in ancient times, foreign folk mostly, hanging on by threads thin as spider silk. Their masters were worse than any plantation owner, dealing in flesh both living and dead. And in such darkness what blooms but the blackest flowers of man's nature? The unions come but they was jackals too, feeding off the desperation. There was no escape from that place. No salvation. Just the grinding of the great machine eating up souls and spitting out profit.",
            "In the darkened realm where Poe's words take root there lies a poem called Dream-land. He wrote it and called it among his finest works though who can say what drives a man to such proclamations. Within its verses the word Thulé appears like some ancient signpost, twice marked, once at the beginning and again at the end, and scholars say it comes from Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the world falls away into darkness and ice.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten hold of Poe's mind and would not let go. Among them stood Goethe whose words burned across the century like signal fires. Arndt saw it plain enough in his studying. Said Poe had taken Goethe's measure and sought to match it stride for stride.\n\nThe Oxford books tell of Goethe and his Faust, that great work split in two parts like a cord of wood, the first piece laid down in 1808 and the second not till the year death took him in 1832. And there in the second part lies hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé. It speaks of a king whose queen passes leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that drink won't wash away. When he can bear it no longer he gives away all he owns save that cup and walks to where the earth ends. Throws it to the sea. Closes his eyes. Dies.\n\nThere's something of Poe in that king. Something of the bottle and the grief that drives men to it. The darkness recognizing darkness across the years. Grattan saw it too and made it into theater in 1842, just before Poe took up the word Thulé again in The Pit and the Pendulum.\n\nThulé appears twice in all Poe's work like twin stars in a black sky. Once in Pit and Pendulum and twice more bracketing Dream-Land like dark sentinels. Read them together, these tales of Thulé, and you'll see the same desolate country. A world drained of color where dead friends walk and loneliness spreads like morning frost. It's as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's kingdom and found it matched the geography of his own heart.\n\nGoethe cast a long shadow in those days. Poe would have known him if only through Tennyson whom he admired with a fire that burned fierce and bright. But there were other paths too, other ways Goethe's words might have found him in those years after Faust first spoke its lines to the world.",
            "The law spoke of malice and despicable deeds but the truth was darker than any words writ upon paper by men in their towers of justice. The store manager sat in his office that evening eating his dinner while outside his door the fluorescent lights hummed their dead song over the aisles where the applesauce lay spilled like some pale blood upon the cold tile floor.\n\nFirst it was Wayne who came. Wayne with his hollow eyes and his green apron hanging loose like a condemned man's shroud. He spoke of the spill but the manager only stared at his food and said he had no time for such things. Then came Haddigan quarter hour later speaking the same words but they fell dead in that room like birds struck from winter sky.\n\nThe woman Palmer she came last. Not knowing. Not seeing. The floor stretched out before her like some treacherous river crossing and when she fell it was as if the earth itself had betrayed her. Her back broke not like a branch but like hope itself. In the year before five others had fallen in that same store their bodies betrayed by the same careless disregard that now claimed Palmer as its latest tribute.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations and compensatory damages but these were just words trying to put order to chaos. What mattered was the willful blindness. The conscious turning away. The manager knew what lurked in those aisles having seen five others fall before but still he sat and ate while danger waited patient as death for its next victim.\n\nIn the end it would be for the judge to decide if this negligence rose to the level of malice that the law demanded for punitive damages. If this disregard for human safety was despicable enough to warrant special punishment. The evidence lay before them like artifacts from some darker age - the timestamps of warnings ignored the history of falls that came before the simple fact of a man who chose his dinner over his duty to protect those who walked his aisles.\n\nThe law would have its say but the truth was already written in Palmer's broken body and in the cold calculations of a man who knew the risks but turned away all the same. There would be no summary dismissal here. The facts themselves stood witness dark and damning as cemetery stones.",
            "The wanting came to her like a thirst that wouldn't quit. Started when she was fourteen and held fast through the years that followed, clinging to her like old shadows in dying light. By seventeen it had shaped itself into something else. Not a thing but a someone. The boys came and went, awkward in their pursuit, fumbling at romance like blind men at locks. None took. She studied this peculiarity in herself like reading old maps, searching for landmarks that weren't there, finding only the blank spaces where answers ought to be. So she walked on through her days carrying this thing that had no name.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her people were peaceful folk who moved through rooms like ghosts, their voices soft as ash falling. Arguments were rare as rain in drought lands, save when the girl's wild spirit rose up against their quietude. She carried something fierce and bright in her that stood at odds with their stillness, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThen came the day when peace broke. She was moving room to room, restless as wind, when her mother's cry split the air like lightning. Kitchen-ways. She ran, calling out, her heart a hammer in her chest. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something broken. Pain had hold of her and wouldn't let go. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Mother's words came broken and scattered: hospital, hurry, help. The girl, strong from years of working iron, lifted her mother like a child. Carried her to the waiting car, laid her gentle in the back, and drove through streets empty as dead riverbeds.\n\nThe hospital rose up before them like some concrete monument to suffering. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic and fear, but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like pale wraiths, wheeling out a stretcher. They took her mother away down corridors bright and merciless as desert sun, leaving the girl alone with her worry.\n\nLater they told her: a step-stool, a high cabinet, a vase. Simple things that conspired to bring her mother low. She sat and waited in that place of sickness and healing, watching shadows lengthen across walls white as bone.",
            "They studied the old ways of eating. The Mediterranean way. Not like the others but something darker and more ancient. Something that spoke to the blood and the heart. In the beginning there were seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six women. Nurses all of them. They had no heart disease nor the sugar sickness that plagues mankind. The researchers watched them for twenty years like patient sentinels marking the passage of time and death itself.\n\nThe women wrote down what they ate. Six times over those long years they wrote it all down. What passed their lips and into their bodies. The fruits and the nuts and the grains ground to dust. Fish from the deep waters. The researchers made numbers of these things. Scores they called them. Like marking the passage of the dead but these marked the living.\n\nSome ate like the old ones did. The Mediterranean people. Others did not. The researchers watched and waited. Death came as it always does. Two thousand three hundred and ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred and sixty three minds were starved of blood till they died. The numbers told a story as old as time. Those who ate like the ancients lived longer. Their hearts were stronger. Their blood flowed true.\n\nThey measured everything. The weight of their bodies. The smoke in their lungs. The pills they took to thin their blood. Whether they bore children still or had ceased. Whether they moved their bodies under the sun or sat idle. All of it marked down in ledgers like a careful accounting of souls.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert. Those who followed the old ways, who ate the fruits of the earth and the fish of the sea, they lived. Their hearts beat longer. Their minds stayed clear. The others died sooner, their bodies betraying them like false prophets in the night. Such is the way of things. Such is the price we pay for forgetting the old wisdom that lives in our blood.",
            "The cardboard sign hung there in the gray light. Hitler is alive in Burma. The girl held it above her head like some proclamation of doom, standing alone on that corner where the wind swept ash and old newspapers across the blacktop. She'd been in pictures. Movies that no one would watch anymore.\n\nBurma. Myanmar. Names dont matter now. The junta rose up in 62 like some biblical plague visited upon the people. A darkness. Soldiers with their rifles and their tanks moving through streets where monks in saffron robes walked barefoot carrying nothing but their bowls. The first protests in ten years. Ten years of silence broken by gunfire and screaming and the sound of monastery doors being kicked in. They came for the foreign journalists too. Rounded them up like cattle. Shot them where they stood. A Japanese man named Nagai lay dead in the street on September 27th, his camera still clicking away at nothing as his lifeblood ran into the gutters.\n\nThirteen dead they said. Colonel Win knew better. He'd seen the bodies stacked like cordwood behind the barracks. Several thousand he said. Several thousand souls crying out in the void.\n\nThese things were nothing new. They'd happened before and they'd happen again. The Romans had done it. The Japanese. Now these generals with their medals and their decorated uniforms stained with the blood of their own people. Man has always killed man. Has always found reason to do so. Even now somewhere in the world someone was dying because someone else had decided they should.\n\nTiananmen Square stood as testament. The tanks rolling through the streets crushing the bones of students and workers alike. Two hundred dead said the government. Three thousand said the Red Cross. The truth lay somewhere in between or perhaps beyond both. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Hutu against Tutsi. The streets ran red. And before that there was Hitler. The camps. The chambers. The ovens burning day and night. The ash falling like gray snow. All of it written in the blood of millions. All of it carried in the wind like some dark promise. Some covenant with death that man had made long ago and could not break.\n\nThe girl stood there holding her sign. A witness to things she could not change. To horrors beyond counting. The wind took her hair and whipped it about her face like black smoke. Like a veil. Like something mourning all of mankind.",
            "The old maestro's mark on the music they called jazz came from the long years he spent wielding that orchestra like some dark instrument of God. His hands moved across them ivory keys quiet as a thief in the night but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant waiting to strike. He knew each man in that band like a father knows his sons and he wrote for their souls not just their horns. He'd craft these pieces like some old world artificer building frameworks of brass and wood and gut string where them soloists could roam free as wild horses on the plain. But he could reign them in too when he needed with notes precise as prison bars.\n\nThe sound. Always the sound. He shaped it like a sculptor shapes clay, knew just how to bend it and mold it till it fit right in the ear like it was always meant to be there. Weren't no accident neither. He studied them players like a hunter studies prey, learned the way each one moved and breathed and when he put them all together it was like watching some great machine come to life, all the gears and wheels turning just so.\n\nTake that piece they called Creole Love Call. Six parts to it like the chambers in a revolver and each one loaded different. First comes the voice pure as spring water then turning dark and rough like creek water after rain. Then a trumpet crying out through a mute like some wounded animal in the night. High clarinet floating over it all like a ghost while the piano keeps time below quiet as footsteps in sand. The whole band rises up then like a storm coming, brass and reeds calling back and forth across the darkness till finally that voice returns growling like some creature that aint quite human no more.\n\nHe wrote another one called Hot and Bothered where he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin. Then there was It Don't Mean a Thing where old Tricky Sam's trombone spoke the first words like some preacher starting up a sermon. Each piece different but carrying that same dark blood in its veins. That was the old man's gift. He could make music speak in tongues that wasn't meant for speaking at all.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraled and calcified testimonies to lives long past. The question that gnawed at him was how these creatures came to be what they were, what forces shaped them in the darkness of deep time. Back in 1917 a man named Thompson had written that science hadn't yet found the mathematics to describe even the simplest living things. Truth was, they still hadn't.\n\nThe shell lay before him on the scarred wooden table. Prunum, they called it. He turned it in his fingers, watching how the light played across its surface. They'd taken X-rays of hundreds of these things, feeding numbers into machines that could birth ghost-shells, theoretical forms that might have been or might yet be. The computer program was called CerioShell, though names meant little now.\n\nHe thought about how a shell grows. Like a living geometry, a spiral road through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of pure mathematics, though there was nothing pure about it. The whorls, that's what they called the turns, spinning around an invisible axis they named columella, though it was really just the spine of the thing. Each whorl separated by a line they called a suture, like stitches holding the whole thing together.\n\nThe biggest part, the body whorl, that's where the creature made its last stand before death took it. Above that, the spire rose like a tower of previous lives, previous moments, all the way to the apex. At the bottom, the base. And there in the opening, the aperture, that's where life once crept in and out, conducting its business with the world.\n\nYou could look at these things from any angle. From above, from below, from the front where the creature once emerged. He'd learned to count the whorls, drawing lines across the shell's face like measuring time itself, quarter turn by quarter turn, marking the slow accretion of calcium and purpose.\n\nHe thought about how each shell was really just a series of doorways, each aperture a frozen moment in the creature's journey through time. You could trace it, map it, try to capture it in numbers and equations. But in the end, it was all just guesswork at God's geometry, trying to understand why things grew the way they did, why life chose the paths it chose.\n\nThe mathematics of it all lay there like a dead language, waiting to be resurrected. But even then, even if you could speak it perfectly, you'd still just be describing shadows on a cave wall, not the thing itself. Not the force that drove it all.",
            "They stood there in the dim light of the government office studying the numbers on the wall. Charts and figures that told of dead children. Ten years worth of them laid out in cold statistics that hadnt changed. Numbers that spoke of mothers too. The boy looked up at him. What does it mean papa.\n\nIt means they're dying son. Same as they always did.\n\nIn the cities and in the villages they died. The lucky ones had someone there. Someone who knew the old ways of bringing life into the world. But knowledge aint always enough. When the blood comes. When things go wrong. They called them midwives but they might as well have been ghosts for all the good they could do when death came calling.\n\nHe remembered the hospital in Jakarta. Clean white walls and machines that beeped in the night. Seven of every hundred mothers got their babies cut from them there. In the villages it was two. Numbers that told a story of who lived and who died based on nothing more than where they drew their first breath.\n\nThe poor died more. Always had. Twenty-seven percent more of them never saw inside a hospital than the rich. Money was the difference between life and death and it always had been. Some things dont change even when the world tries to make them change.\n\nThey talked about programs. About targeting specific problems like a hunter sighting down a rifle barrel. Quick fixes and immediate results that looked good on paper. But he knew better. Had seen what happened when you built one thing up while letting everything else crumble. Like trying to prop up one wall of a burning house. The whole thing would come down eventually. Always did.\n\nHe looked at the boy again. The boy was studying the charts with those solemn eyes of his. Papa, he said. Why dont they fix all of it.\n\nBecause son. Sometimes the simplest answer is the hardest one to see.",
            "The music they called Popular had growed and spread like some dark vine across a hundred years til a man couldnt name all its branches anymore. Each limb of it birthing new ones. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk and others nameless and strange. Like some ancient tree whose roots ran deep into the black soil of time. And from these roots come Heavy Metal, forty years past, spreading like wildfire through the musical wasteland. A thing built of darkness and rage but containing multitudes. Raw emotions stripped bare and bleeding. Men saw its power and took to shaping it like hot iron, hammering out new forms til the original shape was lost to memory.\n\nNow the metal stands transformed, a thousand faces staring back from the dark. A thing that feeds on other music like some desperate creature, taking what it needs, leaving the rest to rot. To know its true nature you got to go back. Back to where it began. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal dwells in darkness like some cave-thing. Always wanting more. More thunder in the bass, more violence in the sound, more theater in the spectacle. These weren't no primitive players neither. These were men who knew their tools like a hunter knows his knife. And there was the drugs too, coursing through it all like poison in the blood. Mid-seventies when the psychedelics hit hard and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like something born in fever dreams. It carried things in it that other music wouldn't touch. Dark things. Visceral things. Things that reached back to them old Romantic composers who knew about darkness too. The kind of darkness that makes a man write words like these here below, though the paper they was writ on is long since ashes.\n\nThem Beatles, they wrote Helter Skelter trying to outdo the Stones. Show em they could walk in darkness too. Some say it was the first real Metal song, though such things aint easy to reckon. A song about going up and down, about losing your mind to them pills and powders. They put it on that white album like a black mark on a clean sheet.",
            "In the time before the dreamers came with their wild paintings there was another who walked alone. Rousseau was his name and he crafted visions that came to him in the deep of night, both real and imagined. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, and in it lay not just some woman lost in wonderment at the strange country round her but Rousseau's own yearnings that gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition he sought. Acceptance too. These things burned in him while he walked the path between what others wanted and what his hands knew to do.\n\nHe was born in a place called Laval where the wind comes hard off the northwest coast of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware and they didnt starve. No teachers showed him the way of art. He worked for the government collecting tolls till he was forty years gone from his birth, though some called him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Only Julia lived. The grief sat in him like stone and he took up the brush hoping it might wash clean what was stained.\n\nHe painted different from the others who made pretty pictures of country folk. He painted true because he was of them. Common blood. Common dreams.\n\nThe art world was a beast he could not tame. Started late with no learning and worked alongside men who'd mastered the craft in their youth. Matisse was rising then, but they were different sorts entirely. Matisse feared the common way of painting like it was death itself while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make something so right and proper that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy to men who walk alone.",
            "He sat there thinking on them things that men before him had thought on. Ethics and beauty and how they was bound together like flesh to bone. Old Keats had wrote it down plain as day on that grecian urn of his. Beauty is truth and truth beauty and that was all there was to know in this world. Most everything a man learns comes by way of books or hard living but these things was different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how describing beauty or goodness was like trying to catch smoke in your hands. You could talk about the Mona Lisa's shadows or the way the background stretched away behind her like something from a fever dream but that wasnt it. That wasnt what made it beautiful. Folk would always say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Like they knew the words wasnt enough.\n\nHe remembered what that woman O'Connor had said about stories. How they was meant to say things that couldn't be said no other way. Like they was carrying something bigger than words. Something that lived in the spaces between em. And he reckoned it was the same with right and wrong. That writer Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics couldn't be spoke of proper cause they was beyond speaking.\n\nThe connection twixt the two of them, art and morals, it lived in that place you couldn't quite reach. Like trying to remember a dream that slips away soon as you wake. The deeper truth of it all existed somewhere past what a man could put into words. Literature carried it strongest of all the arts cause it dealt in the currency of life itself. Values and choices and the hard paths men walk. The things that make us human in this godless world.\n\nHe watched the sun sink below the horizon, painting the sky in colors that no artist could capture. Thought about how some truths cant be spoke, only felt in the marrow of your bones. How beauty and goodness was like that. Beyond telling. Beyond knowing. Just there, waiting to be found by them that had eyes to see.",
            "The land lay ancient and cold beneath the alpine shadows stretching north like some great beast's spine from München to the dark waters of the Baltic where Kiel stood sentinel against the gray horizon. The old ways persisted here like blood in the earth, seeping through the stones of Köln where the Rhine carved its path and eastward through Saxon country where Dresden brooded by the Elbe's sluggish waters. This was Germania.\n\nThey called it different names in the old tongue. Some said it came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine in times before memory, when the world was younger and the gods walked closer to men. Caesar knew them. Wrote of them in his accounts of blood and conquest, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Rome's heel. The Germans remained untamed, wild things that lurked beyond the river's far bank, emerging in the night with spears they called ger, their war-cries splitting the darkness like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote of them too, scratching his observations onto parchment while Rome's streets baked under Mediterranean sun. He saw them as creatures of the soil, born from the earth itself, unmixed with foreign blood. Who would choose such a place, he wondered. Who would abandon warm southern climes for this raw country with its sullen skies and forests that whispered old secrets in tongues no Roman could comprehend.\n\nThe Romans came nonetheless, drawn by amber and fur and things that glittered in the ground. They built their roads and fortresses but never stayed, always returning to their marble columns and heated baths, leaving Germania to its shadows. The tribes remained, trading their forest-wealth for Roman coin, sending their young men to march beneath imperial eagles while their true gods waited patient in the deep woods, knowing Rome's time would pass like all things must, while Germania endured, eternal as the stones.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some ancient tapestry gone yellow with age, threads bare in places where time has gnawed at the fabric. Deception lies at its heart, a dark and necessary thing, like a knife kept ready against the wolves. But there is a cost to wearing masks and the soul knows this cost even if the mind does not. The self becomes a stranger in its own skin and must one day choose between preservation and the bonds that tie it to others. Some will forgive the lie. Others will carry it like a wound that never heals.\n\nWhen the mask is one of gender it cuts deeper still. The question hangs in the air like smoke - why would one abandon the shelter of their own flesh? For Viola it was survival pure and simple. The words fall from her lips like stones: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" She speaks of preservation but what is preserved is merely the body while the spirit wanders lost in the wilderness of pretense.\n\nThe deception works its dark magic but leaves her cut off from her own kind, adrift in a world of women who cannot know her. And Olivia, poor Olivia, sees in her the ghost of Sebastian and loves what is not there: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words echo hollow in the empty air. Even Orsino carries the weight of unspoken desire: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nTo modern eyes the play might seem to speak of hidden hungers, of desires that dare not speak their names. Olivia and Orsino move through their scenes like sleepwalkers, their true hearts masked even from themselves. But perhaps Shakespeare saw deeper still, saw how Olivia's quick transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian marked her as one who loved with her eyes alone, as if the heart could be fooled by mere appearance. At the last she names Viola sister - \"A sister, you are she\" - and in those words lies both acceptance and forgiveness, as if the truth, once spoken, could wash clean all that came before.",
            "They called it German rule but there was nothing German about the blood. Blood speaks its own tongue and the Herero and Nama knew it well when the Germans came with their rifles and their orders and their need to plant flags in foreign soil. The land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nIn the east they built schools. Built them like they meant something. Like knowledge could bridge what guns had sundered. The British found them there when they came. Found the africans who could read and write and cipher numbers. Found them in Tanganyika and in Kamerun too. But in the southwest there was nothing. Nothing but missionaries wandering like pilgrims through the wasteland spreading their word to empty air while the government watched and did nothing.\n\nThe whites got their schools though. Got them built proper with government coin. Got their children taught proper too while the natives watched from beyond the windows, their faces pressed against glass that showed them nothing but their own reflection. Most never learned to read. Most never learned to write. Most just learned to survive.\n\nThe southwest was different. Different in ways that spoke of deeper things. Of older things. Things that lived in the hearts of men who came to plant their flags and spread their seed. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand strong. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their conquered realm. The climate suited them they said. Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right for making something of their own. Something that would last.\n\nBut the land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nThey wrote about it later. Wrote about it in German first then English. Wrote about how different it was from place to place. Territory to territory. How the schools worked here but not there. How the teaching took root in some soil but not in others. They had their reasons. Their explanations. Their theories written in neat lines on clean paper. But paper burns and ink fades and in the end there is only the land and what it remembers.",
            "They stood at the border, these two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide that stretched fifty-seven years deep into time. From 1836 to 1893 they circled and prowled, the United States and Mexico, their rivalry carved into the very bones of the earth. The war came in 1846 like some dark tide rising, Americans moving south with their rifles and their god, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in blood and dust and gunsmoke.\n\nThe border between them was a thing alive, a serpentine line drawn in sand and stone where cultures ground against each other like tectonic plates. Religion stood between them like a wall. Protestant and Catholic, each carrying the ghosts of old world hatreds in their veins, the English and Spanish dead whispering ancient grievances into living ears.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those years, most often over the borderlands where outlaws and brigands moved like wraiths through the desert night. Raiders crossed back and forth, leaving destruction in their wake until both nations sent their armies to stand watch in the wastes. The border towns existed in a kind of twilight, neither here nor there, where a man might wake to find himself in one country or another depending on which way the wind had blown the sand that night.\n\nThe rivalry was a living thing until it wasn't. Like some great beast lying down to die, it faded as Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor. The United States no longer looked to the land with hungry eyes but turned its gaze to money and markets. The old hatreds didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledgers instead of bodies.\n\nThey share that border still, these two nations, though the nature of their dance has changed. The ghosts of old conflicts walk those lands yet, their footprints hidden beneath the shifting sands of time, waiting for those who know where to look. In the end it was not god or guns that bridged the divide but the cold arithmetic of commerce, turning blood-soaked earth into columns of numbers, transforming ancient enmity into profit and loss.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety that came from having none as a child. They'd all say it - you'll always find work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing trade though it wasn't what my heart wanted.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone, nothing saved, and the work gone from me like smoke. Still am broken, these fifteen years later. Living on government handouts has stripped me bare. Everything I once called mine is gone now. Each day's a battle against the void, against the feeling of being less than whole. Nothing's certain anymore except one truth that burns like a coal in the dark - I wouldn't have survived without my people. Family. The few friends who stayed. When the real darkness comes you learn quick how weak you really are.\n\nThat's the thing about catastrophe. It comes without warning. No matter how you shore up against it, some storms are too big to weather alone. Like them old pioneers crossing the mountains. Conservatives preach about going it alone but that ain't how the wagons made it west. It was sharing. Looking out. Helping hands in the night.\n\nSo yes, lay in your stores. I got mine - medical supplies, water tablets, tape for the windows against whatever poison might come on the wind. Flashlights. Batteries. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods lined up like soldiers. Plant your garden if you got the land. Stack your wood if you got a stove to burn it.\n\nBut while you're preparing for the end of things, know your neighbors. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't rugged independence that'll save us. It's the light we keep burning for each other.",
            "In the old world, before the steel and concrete rose up to mock the heavens, there lived a prince. They would later call him Buddha though that wasnt his name then. None knew what would come. He cast off the gilded chains of his station like a snake shedding its skin and walked into the wastes of the world until enlightenment found him or he found it, who could say. What he taught became Buddhism and the Theravada sect claimed to hold closest to his words, though who could know after twenty five hundred years of men's tongues wagging and their minds forgetting.\n\nIn Sri Lanka they cut the water now. Some ceremony the Buddha never spoke of. Monks in their saffron robes and the common folk too, gathering like pilgrims at some ancient well. The faith had changed like everything changes, wearing smooth like river stones beneath the endless flow of time. The guardians of the old ways, both robed and common, had bent like reeds in the wind, doctrine twisting and reshaping itself against forces from within and without. Some came with fire and sword, others with mere indifference, each leaving their mark like the tide leaves its mark upon the shore.\n\nThey spoke of internal forces and external ones as if such things could be parsed clean like butchered meat. Internal meant those who claimed the Buddha's way as their own, external meant all others though such divisions meant little in the end. Then there were those who came meaning harm and those who meant nothing at all, though harm or help might follow in their wake like carrion birds following a war party.\n\nAt the heart of it lay the triple gem they sought refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma held in three baskets of ancient words: the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its rules, the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of things. They spoke of Anatta - the absence of soul, Dukkha - the suffering that clings to life like smoke to clothing, Anicca - how nothing lasts, nothing stays, everything crumbles to dust in time. Only by seeing these truths could one break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and rebirth grinding on and on like some cosmic mill wheel. Then would end the holy trinity of man's afflictions: desire, hatred, delusion. The rules came after, five for common folk - no killing, no lying, no stealing, no rutting like beasts, no drowning sense in drink or smoke. More rules for the monks, though rules were just words and words were wind.\n\nFour noble truths stood at the center like stone pillars in a temple: that life was suffering, that wanting caused the suffering, that suffering could end. These were the bones everything else was built upon."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The God of scripture and testament. Not some other god dreamed up in the minds of lesser men but the true God if there was such. To speak of other gods would muddy the waters and that wouldnt serve.

Wrote of how Fannie Mae, that great beast of mortgage and loan, was pressed by men in suits to give money to those who had none. To maintain its hunger for profit. Holmes saw what was coming like a prophet in the waste. Saw the government would have to reach down with its cold hand and save what was left, same as they done before with the savings and loans in the eighties.\n\nThey made new kinds of money then. Strange words for strange things. Adjustable-rate mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. Like incantations. Like prayers to dead gods. The money-men wove these things together till you couldnt tell where one ended and another began. Till the whole country was caught in this web of debt and promise.\n\nWhen it broke it broke hard. The five great houses of investment banking stood with four trillion in debt, near a third of all the nation's worth. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies. Lehman Brothers died in the street. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed, made to wear the chains of regulation like penitents. Fannie and Freddie, five trillion in debt between them, became wards of the state in the ninth month of 2008. The government took them in like orphans. Like foundlings. But they were not innocent.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached in desert sun. No life in them. No blood neither. Just facts piled on facts like the stacked cordwood he'd seen as a boy, waiting for the fire that would consume them all.\n\nHe studied the page before him. The way of telling tales aint to tell them at all, his father had said once. Show em the truth of things. The weight and heft. Let em feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.\n\nHe thought about exposition. That dark and nameless thing that crept into stories like a thief. Stealing life from words. Draining the blood from tales that ought to pulse with it. Making dead things of living stories.\n\nThere was a right way and a wrong way and the difference twixt them was vast as the space between stars. You could say a man was Air Force once and managed a gas station nights and married twice with no young ones to show for it and dreamed of owning that station someday. You could say all that. But it wouldn't show the way his hands still moved like he was touching sky when he walked the empty forecourt at midnight. Wouldn't show how he touched the wedding band he still wore like it was both blessing and curse. Wouldn't show how his eyes went distant when cars pulled in trailing highway dust, like maybe one day it'd be someone he knew from back then. Back when he flew. When he was something else entirely.\n\nThe telling of tales was like breaking wild horses. You couldn't rush it. Couldn't force it. Had to let it come natural as breathing. Had to let the story find its own way home.\n\nHe looked at the words again. Dead things. No pulse in them. No breath neither. He'd have to start over. Show the truth of things. The weight and the heft. Let them feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.",
            "He watched the screen flicker in the dark of morning, the news from Columbus casting its pale glow across the room. August thirteenth two thousand and eleven. First came word of Ashley where a man named Hostettler had done his wife with a knife. They showed his face, a darkness in it like something youd see in an old daguerreotype of a murderer. Evil plain as day. Two minutes worth and done.\n\nThen the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years on this earth and now shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moving through the streets like black beetles. Brief telling, too brief maybe, like they didnt care much for stories about colored folk getting shot. Been that way long as he could reckon. White child goes missing they sound all the bells in christendom but let it be someone with dark skin and silence falls like ash.\n\nWord came of a bullet hole found in one of them flying ambulances. Twenty-two caliber they said. Rifle shot. Money offered for the shooter, five thousand dollars worth of thirty pieces of silver.\n\nWeather man stood there in his suit talking about rain coming. Thunder too. Heat holding in the eighties like it was afraid to leave. Quick tell, wanting folks to stay put and watch more.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark skinned man they said, wearing a hood like death himself. Six foot tall and lean as a fence post. They went on about his blackness like it was all that mattered in gods creation.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, some drug lord from Texas moving weed up north like it was cotton in the old days. Three hundred months they gave him. Not twenty-five years mind you but three hundred months like they was counting out each one special. Made sure to say he was Hispanic too, though what bearing that had on anything he couldnt figure. World's got its own way of marking people, he reckoned, whether they ask for it or not.",
            "He sat there studying the papers before him, numbers swimming like black minnows in a dark pool. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world outside but here in this room they held some power still, some echo of the old times when men traded paper for promises and promises for gold.\n\nThe figures lay stark against the white sheets. Cold numbers telling cold truths about money and worth and things that no longer existed except in the minds of those who remembered. Ten holdings they showed, top ones they said, making up near sixty-four percent of what they called assets. Assets. As if anything could be held fast in this world.\n\nHe thought about diversification. A word from the old world. Like spreading seed across many fields instead of one, hoping some would take root and grow while others withered. The numbers showed it plain as day. The ten-stock portfolio running higher than its parent fund by six point eleven percent. A ghost of better returns haunting the pages. Beta lower by point twelve. Numbers that meant something once, when men still believed in such things.\n\nStandard deviations lined up like prisoners against a wall. Each stock contributing its measure of risk, its portion of uncertainty to the whole. Statistical significance. As if statistics could capture the true nature of risk in a world where everything had already been lost.\n\nThe charts stretched out before him like a map of some dead country. IHF they called it, letters that once meant something to someone. Now just marks on paper, telling tales of holdings and returns and measures of things that no longer mattered. Yet he studied them still, like a man reading ancient runes, searching for meaning in the ashes of the financial world.\n\nHe thought about the old days when men spoke of sharp ratios and optimal returns. When they believed they could measure risk against reward and find some perfect balance between the two. But he knew better now. Knew that all portfolios, all investments, all carefully laid plans were just dust in the wind. Yet still he ran the numbers. Still he searched for patterns in the chaos. Because that's what men do. They search for order even when they know there is none to be found.",
            "The numbers fell away like dying leaves in that third month. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough and there was no hiding from it. The logs dried up and blew away on the winter wind that swept across that New England campus, taking with it the bicycle riders and the footbound travelers alike. December it was, when the semester draws its last rasping breath and the people scatter to their tasks like blown ash. Grading and schoolwork consuming them whole. The commuter logs forgotten like old photographs in a drawer.\n\nThe holiday season came down on them like a shroud. Students and teachers alike vanished into that monthlong darkness, the campus standing empty and cold as a dead church. When they returned in the late January thaw the numbers stayed low, dried up, a riverbed in drought. February brought no relief and none could say why. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, the way fire burns bright then dims to coals and finally to nothing but gray dust. They created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flare in the dark, and it drew some back like moths but not enough. Never enough.\n\nThey were up against something older than winter, deeper than snow. The American love of the automobile ran in their blood like a fever. Freedom and motion, the wide empty road calling. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't make him choose them. They tried with prizes - gift cards for food and drink, for books and comforts. But perhaps they should have gone bigger. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars that run quiet as ghosts. Could have parceled them out slow, like bait. Let the prizes grow month by month until they had something worth killing for. Might have kept them interested. Might have kept them coming back. But they'd never know now. The past was the past and it was written in stone and ash.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, these trick films from the dawn of moving pictures. Fifteen of them all told from 1895 to 1901. Strange ghosts dancing in the darkness, illusions wrought by men long dead who'd spliced together strips of celluloid like witch doctors working their magic.\n\nMost of them followed the old ways. Set-bound pictures they were, shot straight on like some demonic theatre stage, the camera bolted down and immovable as stone. No movement save what danced within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all they knew then. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. But there were others. Others that came later. Others that dared break these ancient laws.\n\nThe pictures shared a common blood. Interior sets all of them, framed like some godless proscenium arch where dark things happened. The camera stood mute witness, didnt follow nothing that moved within its gaze. Like vaudeville shows or magic acts, remnants of dead traditions carried forward into this new world. Figures moved sideways like crabs, never toward the glass eye that watched them. He thought of Uncle Josh in that spooky hotel, that old film from 1900. Josh moving back and forth like a prisoner in his cell, never closer, never further, trapped in that two-dimensional hell.\n\nThe way they framed it all kept everything at arms length. No close-ups in these demon reels. Theatre folk knew nothing else back then, showed everything at once like God himself watching from above. Actors stayed in their place like good tin soldiers, never daring approach the eye that watched them perform their strange rituals.\n\nMost followed the old rule - one shot one film. Brief little things they were, minute or less depending on how fast they cranked that handle. Not much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and magic and people appearing and vanishing like smoke. But even then they knew how to lie with pictures. He thought of Mary Queen of Scots, that film from 95. Watched close enough you could see where they stitched together the shots, where they worked their dark magic to make you believe they'd cut off her head right there before your eyes.\n\nThese were sorcerer's tools, these first moving pictures. Made by men who knew how to bend light and time to their will. Dead men now, all of them. But their ghosts still danced in the darkness, trapped forever in their silver cage, performing their tricks for empty rooms and forgotten dreams.",
            "The Gothic novel stands as both old and new, a thing caught between worlds like some ancient specter haunting modern halls. Some men praise it and some curse it and some say it has no depth at all while others speak of its terrible power to shake the soul. But they're all wrong and they're all right and that's the way of things.\n\nThe first of them was Walpole's Castle of Otranto. He took what was old and made it new again like some dark alchemist working with words instead of metal. The medieval ghosts and the modern ways of telling stories all mixed together in that cursed place he built with ink and paper. Gothic they called it then and Gothic they call it now though the word means something different to every man who speaks it. It was a thing out of time even then. Something that didn't belong. But that's what gave it power.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through these tales like black veins in marble. Knights and honor and all the things men once held dear but had forgotten. Walpole saw the world around him going dark and godless, the old virtues dying like leaves in winter, and he wrote of better times. Or what he thought were better times. Maybe they never were. But in his mind they stood like ancient towers against a blood-red sky.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes of Frederic. A prince who'd known suffering. A man who'd walked through fire and come out changed. They said the infidels had killed him but death ain't always what we think it is. He was everything a knight should be, everything Walpole thought the world had lost. But even then the writer knew he was painting with colors too bright for this world. Making something that couldn't exist no more, if it ever did.\n\nThat's what Gothic is. A dream of something lost. A nightmare of something coming. Both at once and neither one complete. Like watching shadows dance on cave walls and trying to say what makes them move.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two when a man named Oliver put words to what had always been. The moving of things through the world. Raw materials to finished goods. Production to customer. All of it connected like the bones of some great beast that stretched across the land.\n\nSix parts made up this beast. Production and supply. Inventory and location. Transportation and information. These were the things that men in suits would use to serve the nameless masses who waited in the dark for their goods.\n\nProduction came first like some terrible birth. It was the foundation stone. The bedrock. It determined the when and the where and the how of things made. Men who managed such things needed to know what the masses wanted and they looked to the market like seers reading entrails. The market never lied. It told them what to make and how many and where best to make them. They'd pick their plants careful. Looking for volume and quality like prophets seeking signs in the sky.\n\nHe remembered the stores where he'd worked. Walmart. Target. Each had their own scripture. Their own gospel of how things should be. Books that told a man how to dress. How to receive the great trucks that came in the night. It was all written down somewhere. Every detail accounted for like some industrial catechism.\n\nSupply came next. Strategic choices about what could be done inhouse and what needed other hands. Some products were like wandering souls passing through many bodies before they found their final form. Each stop needed different tools. Different skills. Sometimes they'd send the work away to other companies. Outsourcing they called it. A way to keep the velocity. Velocity was their god. The ability to move fast and bend like reeds while keeping the costs low. Always the costs. The numbers written in red in ledgers like the blood of some sacrificial thing.\n\nThey had made a religion of it all. A way to move things through the world that was as old as the first trade routes but now had new names. New prophets. New ways to count the cost of everything while knowing the value of nothing.",
            "They was different them Victorian books. All of them filled with their fancy details and lords and ladies and such but there was two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights they was called. Something deeper in them books. Something that crawled up out of the dark like some nightborn thing. Made the people in them stories more real somehow. More true.\n\nHe remembered the passage bout Oliver. The boy caught between Sikes and Crackit like some small creature trapped between two wolves. Words come at him like shots in the dark. Gunfire and shouts and lights all swirling round in his head while pain ate at him like some hungry thing that wouldnt die. Pain that followed him through the dark like a shadow.\n\nThe books they used dreams. Strange visions that come in the night showing what was real and what wasnt. In Oliver's tale these dreams showed what the boy really was inside. What ate at his soul. That shooting scene when it finally come round again in chapter 28 it showed how the boy had no control over nothing. Like a leaf in a river. The pain wasnt sharp no more but stretched out endless like the road ahead. Some unseen hand dragging him away into the dark.\n\nThe boy's defeat hung in the air like smoke. Old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that might not never be fixed. Time itself went strange. Day become night become day again. All of it bleeding together in the endless dark. No dawn. No hope. Just the silence eating away at everything until there wasnt nothing left but shadows and pain.",
            "There was a time I minded children at a school. After hours. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy called Adrian. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with him. The letters on the page they meant nothing to him. Some he knew and others were foreign things. Dark eyes. Dark hair. Latino blood in him sure enough but he spoke English pure as rain.\n\nWe went on like that for a time. Then one day his mother came. The others had gone on a trip somewhere and I was watching the ones left behind. She didnt speak no English. Not a word. Just Spanish soft and low like a prayer. My own Spanish was poor but we made do. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters is all. Whether that knowledge helped him any I cant say. I hope it did.\n\nI tell this tale because of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the tongue they speak in. Aint always clear as you might think. Even a child speaking English pure as spring water might stumble on the written word like it was stones in a creek bed. We all know the problem's there. Question is what to do about it. For Adrian it wasnt so hard. Just needed teaching in the English way of letters. But for them that barely speak English at all its harder. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language. Immersion. Private teaching. ESL. None of these alone will fix what's broke. Got to put them all together like pieces of a broken plate.\n\nThe dual language way it's good. Not just for Spanish speakers neither but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folks fear it. Say it's wasteful. Say most children won't get nothing from it. That aint true. If we was to make it the rule instead of the exception every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Make all teachers speak both tongues? No. That aint possible. But we could have helpers. Special ones who know both languages. Like bridges between two worlds.",
            "From when we're young they tell us there's somethin bigger than us out there in the dark. Somethin we cant wrap our minds around no matter how hard we try. They send you off to learn about it in buildings made of wood and stone where the light comes in through colored glass and makes shapes on the floor like old ghosts. Some take to it natural like breathin while others fight against it like its a tide trying to pull them under. Either way we're all searchin for something to light our way through the dark of this world.\n\nMy daddy told me once it was cardinals he liked best. We was sittin on the porch, him and me, smokin cigarettes and listenin to the rain beat down on that old tin roof like God himself was throwin stones. The gutters was overflowin, water pourin down like some biblical flood meant to wash everything clean. Daddy just sat there starin out into the gray waste of that evenin, his clothes hangin off him like they belonged to some bigger man who'd gone away and left them behind. His hair had gone thin too, like time itself was erasin him bit by bit. Neither of us said nothin about what was comin. Sometimes words just make things more real than they ought to be. I moved my chair closer to his and we both watched the rain fall in the fadin light.\n\nHe died in December that year. Five days after I turned twenty-two. They'd pumped him full of poison to kill the thing that was killin him but all it did was make him suffer longer. I lay in my bed at night wonderin what kind of God would do such a thing. I didnt pray. If there was a God up there he'd stopped listenin to folks like us a long time ago.\n\nI didnt go to watch him die. Couldnt. The life that made me was endin and I couldnt bear to see it go. I wanted to remember him like he was that day on the porch, still whole enough to smoke a cigarette and talk about birds. I knew him better than any of them did and he wouldnt have wanted his boy watchin him slip away into whatever darkness was waitin for him. So I curled up in my bed like some wounded animal and waited for word that he was gone.\n\nNobody even called to tell me when it happened. Like he just disappeared into that gray rain we'd watched together, leaving nothing behind but smoke and memory.",
            "He came in the night to write of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who held fast to the old Republican ways like a drowning man clutches at floating timber. Taylor was a farmer first and foremost and it was the dirt and the growing things that shaped him into what he would become. The land spoke to him of freedom and sovereignty and justice and he listened well.\n\nThe new nation lay before him raw and unmolded, like clay waiting for the potter's hands. No ancient customs to bind them, no dead kings' laws to chain their thoughts. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible beauty. He knew that the rights of men were like bones in a body, break one and the whole form fails, weaken one and all grow dim. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government's grasp.\n\nHe spoke often of man's nature, how it carried both light and dark like twin seeds waiting to sprout. The government must account for both, he said, must be built knowing the truth of what lay in men's hearts. Good principles protect what a man owns, let him work his land, keep the moneylenders at bay. But even good principles cant wash clean what dwells in the souls of those who govern. Self-interest moves in all men like blood in their veins, he said, and its only evil when it feeds off others like a parasite.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like scripture that must be read true and careful. He wanted the Federal government small and contained, like a fire in a hearth that warms but doesn't burn the house down. He knew that power and money flow together like twin rivers and both can drown a nation. But words alone weren't enough, he said. You had to know the mind of the men who wrote them. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states instead of one great beast.\n\nHe believed in these things with a fervor that burned cold and steady, like stars in a winter sky. The agrarian way was his religion and the land was his church and he preached its gospel until his last breath.",
            "He stood there watching the bowl. Silent. The mind working at it like some broken machine, grinding away at what lay before him but never quite catching hold. Thoughts came and went like ash on the wind. No purchase. No meaning. Just the looking.\n\nYears back hed bought him a book on account of what some artist told him. About drawing with the brain. Right side they called it though he didnt know why. Six years old and wanting to make pictures appear on paper like magic and now here was this book telling how to frame the world. How to section it off from all else. Like taking that bowl of fruit in someones kitchen and making it float there in space. Making it something else entirely.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt find that frame if his life depended on it. Too much. Far too much. He thought about them painters. Picasso with his blues. Monet in his gardens. Them Italian fellows with their colors bright as blood. If he was to make his mark in the world of art this here would be his beginning. His own personal brown period.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Muscles pulled and twisted like something alive down in there. Water moving like glass. Clear and cold. Bits breaking off and floating away to nowhere. Second time harder. More violent. Handle cracking against the porcelain but that brown mass just sat there like something dead. Like something that had never been alive at all.\n\nHe stood there in his green tie that choked at his throat. Feet planted like a man about to take a blow. Mop loose in his grip while he studied that thing someone had left there in the Rite Aid toilet. Message written in the oldest language there was. He pulled at the paper. Wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Drew himself up straight then bent slow at the middle. Hand going down into that water like reaching into hell itself.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt. The men in white coats at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark caverns of skull and bone. But there's more to it than that. More than just the rawness of youth and inexperience that sends them careening off the hardtop into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving through the night in metal coffins, radio sounds bleeding into the darkness. The studies showed it plain as bones bleaching in the sun - more died when they traveled together. The Southern California men had counted the bodies, mapped the correlation between passenger age and metal twisted against concrete barriers.\n\nThe state men tried to stem the tide with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young ones could drive and times when they couldn't. Rules about who could ride beside them in the night. But these were just words on paper, thin as ash.\n\nThe truth lay deeper. Cold and hard as winter ground. These children, these drivers barely grown, could not bear the weight of steel and speed. Even at eighteen, said the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for speed and danger burns in them like fever. USA Today printed his words but nobody listened. Nobody wanted to hear that the children of the boom times were coming, millions strong, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the driver's seat till eighteen years had passed. Let the schools teach them in safety, behind desks and in lots where no blood could flow. Make them wait. Make them learn. Six hours behind the wheel with teachers watching. Fifty more with adults beside them. That's how they did it in California and it could work everywhere if the law men had the guts to make it so.\n\nHe thought about the dead ones. How they lay scattered across all the states like fallen leaves. How the numbers kept rising like flood waters in spring. This wasn't new thinking. Others had seen it too. But seeing wasn't enough. Never had been. Never would be.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents speaking of a thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder. CAPD they called it. Like the names of dead gods or forgotten machines. Three parts to it there were. The definition and then the diagnosis and then what could be done in the classroom. As if anything could be done. As if anything could be done at all.\n\nThe disorder lived in the brain like some dark creature coiled in the deep folds of gray matter. Not in the ears themselves for they worked right enough but in the processing of the sounds themselves. The translation of them. As if the brain spoke one tongue and the ears another and somewhere in between the two languages had been lost. Like pilgrims wandering in some vast cavern with no light to guide them.\n\nThey'd found it first in the fifties. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. They'd developed tests for the children who couldn't hear right even though their ears worked fine. Then Kimura came with his dichotic testing. Whatever that was. Whatever that meant in this world or any other.\n\nThe signs showed themselves like tracks in ash. A person couldn't tell where sounds came from in the room. Couldn't tell one sound from another or understand when someone's voice changed from serious to mocking. Like being trapped in a world where everything sounded the same. Everything merged together in a gray soup of noise.\n\nTo find it they had to test. Audiologists and psychologists watching like prophets of old trying to divine meaning from scattered bones. They'd give questionnaires and watch how people acted when sounds came at them. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard. Like some cruel game. More complex tests measured signals in the ear itself but even these weren't certain. Nothing was certain anymore.\n\nHe looked up from the papers. Outside the window the world went on as it always had. Uncaring. Indifferent to the struggles of those who couldn't process its sounds properly. He wondered if they would ever truly understand it. If anyone would.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he knew what the boy was runnin from. Seen it before. The kind of thing that makes the world what it is. Dark and cold and full of them that would do harm to their own blood. He watched the boy's hands shakin and thought about what kind of place this world had become where children flee from their own flesh.\n\nSummer had come and gone since the degree. Psychology. Words on paper that meant nothin when faced with the real darkness in mens souls. The boy had called the law and I went down there to that house. Dark windows like dead eyes watchin. Parents inside with their rehearsed stories and practiced faces. Talkin about simple disputes like evil was just some small thing you could sweep under a rug. Knew right then what I was meant to do in this world.\n\nSocial work aint just about helpin. Its about justice. About standin between the darkness and them that cant fight it alone. Seen too many souls crushed trying to fit into what others say they ought to be. Fought against it my whole life. Hair colored like poison flowers and metal in my ears past what folks thought proper. Stood with them that society said weren't right. Gay. Straight. Whatever name they gave themselves. All just souls trying to live in a world that dont want em different.\n\nWatched too many turn away. Too many denied what was real. But the darkness is there whether you look at it or not. Social work. Thats the path. To stand against the tide of pain that flows through families like poison in the blood. To help them that cant help themselves. These are the values burned into me like brands. Service. Respect. Ethics. All just words for doing what's right in a world gone wrong.\n\nBeen studyin people long enough to know that evil aint always what you think. Sometimes it wears a smile and makes excuses and calls itself love while it breaks everything it touches. But I know what I seen. Know what needs doin. And I aim to do it.",
            "They called it insomnia but that word was too clean for what it was. Sleep that wouldn't come. Sleep that danced away like smoke in the dark while a man lay watching the ceiling fade from black to gray to black again. The biological and the sociocultural, they said. Words to wrap around the darkness like bandages round a wound that wouldn't heal.\n\nThe biological was in the blood and the bone. Inherited like eye color or the shape of a man's hands. Deep in the hypothalamus neurons fired or didn't fire, containing something called orexin that nobody could see but that ruled over sleep and waking like some blind god. GABAB receptors. The words were meaningless but the truth of them was written in the flesh of laboratory mice, poor creatures trapped in mazes of glass and steel while men in white coats watched them dream or fail to dream.\n\nThey found that when you stopped these receptors from their firing the mice would sleep. Simple as that. But nothing was ever simple. The sociocultural they called it. The world outside pressing in. School and work and the endless tasks that filled the days. A man who couldn't sleep couldn't work. Couldn't think. Couldn't be what the world demanded.\n\nSleep disorders came in kinds. Primary disorders and those that rode piggyback on other afflictions of the mind. Dyssomnias they named them, and Parasomnias. More words to wrap around the darkness. Insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Sleep terrors that came in the night like wolves to tear at the mind. Nightmares that left a man sweating in sheets gone cold and damp as cemetery grass.\n\nThe truth was in the blood though. In the genes passed down from father to son like dark inheritance. In the neurons firing or not firing in the deep caves of the brain. In the mice dreaming their mouse dreams in laboratories where men sought answers in microscopes and chemical formulas. But answers were like sleep itself. The harder you chased them the faster they ran.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out as you could go less you counted the stadium standing stark against the gray Pennsylvania sky. The walk from Stuart Hall to classes in Willard, it took near half an hour some days, worse when the weather turned mean like it does in State College, cold and wet and godless.\n\nTalked once with someone who'd walked these grounds before. Said East Halls used to stand alone out there, nothing but empty land stretched between it and civilization like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields spring up from the earth like grave markers. New buildings too. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment complexes ring it all like prison walls. Campus grows like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer, the walks harder.\n\nWhat's the answer to all this? The bicycle. Simple as that. But a bicycle alone aint worth nothing without riders and without ground fit for riding.\n\nMet a boy who'd taken back to riding after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, and there was truth in those words. Bicycle'll take you thirty miles on nothing but a bowl of oatmeal and will. Living off campus now like most who've survived their first year. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made since coming here. Thomas building's my daily destination, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest path there is but it aint friendly to riders nor walkers neither.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight, thirty, forty minutes extra each day just getting to Thomas. That's better than two hours every week lost to nothing but putting one foot before the other. Add in all the other wandering required by this life - classes, meetings, whatever else calls - and you're looking at time you can't afford to lose in this world.\n\nThe bike. That's the answer. Simple as that. But nothing's ever really simple, is it?",
            "He sat there in the dim light of his study, turning the pages of Huxley's prophecy. The words stark and cold upon the page like the bones of dead things. In the book there was a world gone wrong. A world where men had forgotten what it was to be men. Where they'd traded their souls for comfort and their minds for pleasure. He knew this truth deep in the marrow of his bones.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some dark god. Watching. Always watching. The people below him moved like puppets on strings, dancing to music they couldn't hear, following paths they didn't choose. Each class marked and branded from birth, condemned to their station like prisoners in cells they couldn't see.\n\nThey called it conditioning but it was a deeper thing than that. A thing that reached into the very heart of what made a man human and tore it out still beating. The lower classes, the Deltas and Gammas, they moved through their days in a fog of false consciousness, believing the lies whispered into their sleeping minds since before they could walk. Buy, spend, consume. The words like a poison in their blood.\n\nThe upper classes weren't much better. Alphas and Betas with their fine clothes and their empty eyes. They knew the truth of their cage but they chose to stay inside it anyway. All except Bernard, who saw the bars for what they were but couldn't break them.\n\nLove was a dead thing in this world. The characters moved past each other like ghosts, never touching, never connecting. The men spoke of women like they were machines, all parts and functions. Pneumatic, they called them. The women talked of coupling like it was nothing more than scratching an itch. No depth to any of them. No soul.\n\nHe thought about how the classes stayed in their places, neat and ordered like graves in a cemetery. Each one believing they were better than the rest, while the World Controller watched from above and smiled his cold smile. The people consumed and obeyed and never questioned why, like cattle being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThis was Huxley's warning, written in blood and shadow. A world where technology and money had stolen the heart from humanity. Where free will was just another commodity to be bought and sold. Where the individual had been sacrificed on the altar of the community, and no one even remembered what they'd lost.",
            "Four years past I set to learning of Islam at the college. The talk turned always to whether their faith bore violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, that question. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a peculiar kind of tolerance. Back then none would have believed a man called Barack Obama, with Muhammadan blood in his line, could seek the highest office in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands contrary to what history speaks. I'd known him as a warlord who put the sword to men's throats till they spoke his creed. Yet here in these pages he's rendered a martyr, meek as a lamb, persecuted and patient while folk came to him one by one, drawn to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nThere's an echo in these pages that troubles me deep. His miracles mirror Christ's own, most striking when he took mere scraps of meat and milk and made feast enough for forty. The writers craft him thus - humble, seeking no proof of his calling, living quiet in truth and wonder. But this rings false, like thieves who'd steal Christ's crown to set it upon Muhammad's brow.\n\nThe book teems with tales meant to witness how men freely chose his way. But these stories come third-hand or worse, passed down like children's whispers - one heard from another who heard from another still. They aimed to prove truth but bred only doubt, like tracks in sand already half-blown away.\n\nWhat galls most is how they'd paint him gentle and meek, wise and pure of heart. But history tells different tales of blood and iron, and I wonder if his followers today know the true shape of their prophet's rise to power, or if they too are lost in these gentle lies.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days were cast off like old rags, abandoned quick as they came. The truth of it stretches out before us like some barren highway leading nowhere, each mile marker showing how far we strayed from where we started. The world now bears witness to something different, something that moves like a slow tide washing away what came before. There are those who cling to the old ways like drowning men to driftwood but they grow fewer, their voices dimmer in the gathering dark.\n\nAmong the faithful there's a stirring. A knowing that spreads like fire through dry grass. They'll seek to peel away the layers of man's making, strip bare the bones of belief until nothing remains but what the carpenter from Nazareth brought forth into the world. It might take generations, might take centuries, but sure as winter follows autumn it will come. The great undoing. Like watching time flow backward through some broken clock, doctrine falling away piece by piece until only the raw truth remains, unadorned and pure as the day it was spoken.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the West like some great cleansing wind, the churches will still stand but they'll be different. Changed. Where once there were a thousand different paths there'll be one. Unity will rise from the ashes of division like some pale phoenix. We've seen such reversals before, seen how the world can turn itself inside out. Rome once fed Christians to lions and then knelt before the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThis great undoing that's coming will need new eyes to read old words. Not taking every utterance as gospel carved in stone but seeing through to the truth beneath, like looking through clear water to the bottom of a stream.\n\nLong ago, before all this, there was only the faith of Abraham. One God, one truth, one holy book. But even then the cracks were showing. Jerusalem under Roman boots split five ways - the Sadducees in their fine robes, Pharisees with their laws, Essenes in the desert, Zealots with their knives, and the common folk caught between them all like leaves in a wind.",
            "The greed runs deep in men's hearts like some ancient poison coursing through their veins. He'd seen it in The Jungle. Seen how they'd turn on their own kind quick as wolves in winter. No care for them below. No thought for the weak ones. Just the wanting and the having and the getting more.\n\nThe factory men were the worst of them. Stood in their offices high above the killing floors watching the smoke pour forth from their chimneys like some hell-wrought offering to a darker god. Black smoke stretching out across the land far as eye could see, marking their domain like territorial beasts. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing stark against the sky, smoke rivers flowing endless to the world's edge. He knew what it meant. Knew the poison they was putting into the air and earth and water. Didn't matter none to the owners about the folk breathing it or the creatures dying in it.\n\nThe workers were less than nothing to them. Just meat for the machine. They'd work a man till his bones showed through his skin then cast him aside like spent cartridges. No loyalty in that place. No decency neither. Just dollars speaking their cold arithmetic. A man's worth measured in pennies and nickels, his life cheaper than the cattle they slaughtered.\n\nPackingtown they called it. Should have called it Hell's Waiting Room. No laws to protect the workers then. No safety neither. Just the endless grind of the machinery and the screaming of the dying beasts and sometimes you couldn't tell which was which. The people lived there like slaves in ancient times, foreign folk mostly, hanging on by threads thin as spider silk. Their masters were worse than any plantation owner, dealing in flesh both living and dead. And in such darkness what blooms but the blackest flowers of man's nature? The unions come but they was jackals too, feeding off the desperation. There was no escape from that place. No salvation. Just the grinding of the great machine eating up souls and spitting out profit.",
            "In the darkened realm where Poe's words take root there lies a poem called Dream-land. He wrote it and called it among his finest works though who can say what drives a man to such proclamations. Within its verses the word Thulé appears like some ancient signpost, twice marked, once at the beginning and again at the end, and scholars say it comes from Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the world falls away into darkness and ice.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten hold of Poe's mind and would not let go. Among them stood Goethe whose words burned across the century like signal fires. Arndt saw it plain enough in his studying. Said Poe had taken Goethe's measure and sought to match it stride for stride.\n\nThe Oxford books tell of Goethe and his Faust, that great work split in two parts like a cord of wood, the first piece laid down in 1808 and the second not till the year death took him in 1832. And there in the second part lies hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé. It speaks of a king whose queen passes leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that drink won't wash away. When he can bear it no longer he gives away all he owns save that cup and walks to where the earth ends. Throws it to the sea. Closes his eyes. Dies.\n\nThere's something of Poe in that king. Something of the bottle and the grief that drives men to it. The darkness recognizing darkness across the years. Grattan saw it too and made it into theater in 1842, just before Poe took up the word Thulé again in The Pit and the Pendulum.\n\nThulé appears twice in all Poe's work like twin stars in a black sky. Once in Pit and Pendulum and twice more bracketing Dream-Land like dark sentinels. Read them together, these tales of Thulé, and you'll see the same desolate country. A world drained of color where dead friends walk and loneliness spreads like morning frost. It's as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's kingdom and found it matched the geography of his own heart.\n\nGoethe cast a long shadow in those days. Poe would have known him if only through Tennyson whom he admired with a fire that burned fierce and bright. But there were other paths too, other ways Goethe's words might have found him in those years after Faust first spoke its lines to the world.",
            "The law spoke of malice and despicable deeds but the truth was darker than any words writ upon paper by men in their towers of justice. The store manager sat in his office that evening eating his dinner while outside his door the fluorescent lights hummed their dead song over the aisles where the applesauce lay spilled like some pale blood upon the cold tile floor.\n\nFirst it was Wayne who came. Wayne with his hollow eyes and his green apron hanging loose like a condemned man's shroud. He spoke of the spill but the manager only stared at his food and said he had no time for such things. Then came Haddigan quarter hour later speaking the same words but they fell dead in that room like birds struck from winter sky.\n\nThe woman Palmer she came last. Not knowing. Not seeing. The floor stretched out before her like some treacherous river crossing and when she fell it was as if the earth itself had betrayed her. Her back broke not like a branch but like hope itself. In the year before five others had fallen in that same store their bodies betrayed by the same careless disregard that now claimed Palmer as its latest tribute.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations and compensatory damages but these were just words trying to put order to chaos. What mattered was the willful blindness. The conscious turning away. The manager knew what lurked in those aisles having seen five others fall before but still he sat and ate while danger waited patient as death for its next victim.\n\nIn the end it would be for the judge to decide if this negligence rose to the level of malice that the law demanded for punitive damages. If this disregard for human safety was despicable enough to warrant special punishment. The evidence lay before them like artifacts from some darker age - the timestamps of warnings ignored the history of falls that came before the simple fact of a man who chose his dinner over his duty to protect those who walked his aisles.\n\nThe law would have its say but the truth was already written in Palmer's broken body and in the cold calculations of a man who knew the risks but turned away all the same. There would be no summary dismissal here. The facts themselves stood witness dark and damning as cemetery stones.",
            "The wanting came to her like a thirst that wouldn't quit. Started when she was fourteen and held fast through the years that followed, clinging to her like old shadows in dying light. By seventeen it had shaped itself into something else. Not a thing but a someone. The boys came and went, awkward in their pursuit, fumbling at romance like blind men at locks. None took. She studied this peculiarity in herself like reading old maps, searching for landmarks that weren't there, finding only the blank spaces where answers ought to be. So she walked on through her days carrying this thing that had no name.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her people were peaceful folk who moved through rooms like ghosts, their voices soft as ash falling. Arguments were rare as rain in drought lands, save when the girl's wild spirit rose up against their quietude. She carried something fierce and bright in her that stood at odds with their stillness, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThen came the day when peace broke. She was moving room to room, restless as wind, when her mother's cry split the air like lightning. Kitchen-ways. She ran, calling out, her heart a hammer in her chest. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something broken. Pain had hold of her and wouldn't let go. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Mother's words came broken and scattered: hospital, hurry, help. The girl, strong from years of working iron, lifted her mother like a child. Carried her to the waiting car, laid her gentle in the back, and drove through streets empty as dead riverbeds.\n\nThe hospital rose up before them like some concrete monument to suffering. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic and fear, but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like pale wraiths, wheeling out a stretcher. They took her mother away down corridors bright and merciless as desert sun, leaving the girl alone with her worry.\n\nLater they told her: a step-stool, a high cabinet, a vase. Simple things that conspired to bring her mother low. She sat and waited in that place of sickness and healing, watching shadows lengthen across walls white as bone.",
            "They studied the old ways of eating. The Mediterranean way. Not like the others but something darker and more ancient. Something that spoke to the blood and the heart. In the beginning there were seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six women. Nurses all of them. They had no heart disease nor the sugar sickness that plagues mankind. The researchers watched them for twenty years like patient sentinels marking the passage of time and death itself.\n\nThe women wrote down what they ate. Six times over those long years they wrote it all down. What passed their lips and into their bodies. The fruits and the nuts and the grains ground to dust. Fish from the deep waters. The researchers made numbers of these things. Scores they called them. Like marking the passage of the dead but these marked the living.\n\nSome ate like the old ones did. The Mediterranean people. Others did not. The researchers watched and waited. Death came as it always does. Two thousand three hundred and ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred and sixty three minds were starved of blood till they died. The numbers told a story as old as time. Those who ate like the ancients lived longer. Their hearts were stronger. Their blood flowed true.\n\nThey measured everything. The weight of their bodies. The smoke in their lungs. The pills they took to thin their blood. Whether they bore children still or had ceased. Whether they moved their bodies under the sun or sat idle. All of it marked down in ledgers like a careful accounting of souls.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert. Those who followed the old ways, who ate the fruits of the earth and the fish of the sea, they lived. Their hearts beat longer. Their minds stayed clear. The others died sooner, their bodies betraying them like false prophets in the night. Such is the way of things. Such is the price we pay for forgetting the old wisdom that lives in our blood.",
            "The cardboard sign hung there in the gray light. Hitler is alive in Burma. The girl held it above her head like some proclamation of doom, standing alone on that corner where the wind swept ash and old newspapers across the blacktop. She'd been in pictures. Movies that no one would watch anymore.\n\nBurma. Myanmar. Names dont matter now. The junta rose up in 62 like some biblical plague visited upon the people. A darkness. Soldiers with their rifles and their tanks moving through streets where monks in saffron robes walked barefoot carrying nothing but their bowls. The first protests in ten years. Ten years of silence broken by gunfire and screaming and the sound of monastery doors being kicked in. They came for the foreign journalists too. Rounded them up like cattle. Shot them where they stood. A Japanese man named Nagai lay dead in the street on September 27th, his camera still clicking away at nothing as his lifeblood ran into the gutters.\n\nThirteen dead they said. Colonel Win knew better. He'd seen the bodies stacked like cordwood behind the barracks. Several thousand he said. Several thousand souls crying out in the void.\n\nThese things were nothing new. They'd happened before and they'd happen again. The Romans had done it. The Japanese. Now these generals with their medals and their decorated uniforms stained with the blood of their own people. Man has always killed man. Has always found reason to do so. Even now somewhere in the world someone was dying because someone else had decided they should.\n\nTiananmen Square stood as testament. The tanks rolling through the streets crushing the bones of students and workers alike. Two hundred dead said the government. Three thousand said the Red Cross. The truth lay somewhere in between or perhaps beyond both. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Hutu against Tutsi. The streets ran red. And before that there was Hitler. The camps. The chambers. The ovens burning day and night. The ash falling like gray snow. All of it written in the blood of millions. All of it carried in the wind like some dark promise. Some covenant with death that man had made long ago and could not break.\n\nThe girl stood there holding her sign. A witness to things she could not change. To horrors beyond counting. The wind took her hair and whipped it about her face like black smoke. Like a veil. Like something mourning all of mankind.",
            "The old maestro's mark on the music they called jazz came from the long years he spent wielding that orchestra like some dark instrument of God. His hands moved across them ivory keys quiet as a thief in the night but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant waiting to strike. He knew each man in that band like a father knows his sons and he wrote for their souls not just their horns. He'd craft these pieces like some old world artificer building frameworks of brass and wood and gut string where them soloists could roam free as wild horses on the plain. But he could reign them in too when he needed with notes precise as prison bars.\n\nThe sound. Always the sound. He shaped it like a sculptor shapes clay, knew just how to bend it and mold it till it fit right in the ear like it was always meant to be there. Weren't no accident neither. He studied them players like a hunter studies prey, learned the way each one moved and breathed and when he put them all together it was like watching some great machine come to life, all the gears and wheels turning just so.\n\nTake that piece they called Creole Love Call. Six parts to it like the chambers in a revolver and each one loaded different. First comes the voice pure as spring water then turning dark and rough like creek water after rain. Then a trumpet crying out through a mute like some wounded animal in the night. High clarinet floating over it all like a ghost while the piano keeps time below quiet as footsteps in sand. The whole band rises up then like a storm coming, brass and reeds calling back and forth across the darkness till finally that voice returns growling like some creature that aint quite human no more.\n\nHe wrote another one called Hot and Bothered where he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin. Then there was It Don't Mean a Thing where old Tricky Sam's trombone spoke the first words like some preacher starting up a sermon. Each piece different but carrying that same dark blood in its veins. That was the old man's gift. He could make music speak in tongues that wasn't meant for speaking at all.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraled and calcified testimonies to lives long past. The question that gnawed at him was how these creatures came to be what they were, what forces shaped them in the darkness of deep time. Back in 1917 a man named Thompson had written that science hadn't yet found the mathematics to describe even the simplest living things. Truth was, they still hadn't.\n\nThe shell lay before him on the scarred wooden table. Prunum, they called it. He turned it in his fingers, watching how the light played across its surface. They'd taken X-rays of hundreds of these things, feeding numbers into machines that could birth ghost-shells, theoretical forms that might have been or might yet be. The computer program was called CerioShell, though names meant little now.\n\nHe thought about how a shell grows. Like a living geometry, a spiral road through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of pure mathematics, though there was nothing pure about it. The whorls, that's what they called the turns, spinning around an invisible axis they named columella, though it was really just the spine of the thing. Each whorl separated by a line they called a suture, like stitches holding the whole thing together.\n\nThe biggest part, the body whorl, that's where the creature made its last stand before death took it. Above that, the spire rose like a tower of previous lives, previous moments, all the way to the apex. At the bottom, the base. And there in the opening, the aperture, that's where life once crept in and out, conducting its business with the world.\n\nYou could look at these things from any angle. From above, from below, from the front where the creature once emerged. He'd learned to count the whorls, drawing lines across the shell's face like measuring time itself, quarter turn by quarter turn, marking the slow accretion of calcium and purpose.\n\nHe thought about how each shell was really just a series of doorways, each aperture a frozen moment in the creature's journey through time. You could trace it, map it, try to capture it in numbers and equations. But in the end, it was all just guesswork at God's geometry, trying to understand why things grew the way they did, why life chose the paths it chose.\n\nThe mathematics of it all lay there like a dead language, waiting to be resurrected. But even then, even if you could speak it perfectly, you'd still just be describing shadows on a cave wall, not the thing itself. Not the force that drove it all.",
            "They stood there in the dim light of the government office studying the numbers on the wall. Charts and figures that told of dead children. Ten years worth of them laid out in cold statistics that hadnt changed. Numbers that spoke of mothers too. The boy looked up at him. What does it mean papa.\n\nIt means they're dying son. Same as they always did.\n\nIn the cities and in the villages they died. The lucky ones had someone there. Someone who knew the old ways of bringing life into the world. But knowledge aint always enough. When the blood comes. When things go wrong. They called them midwives but they might as well have been ghosts for all the good they could do when death came calling.\n\nHe remembered the hospital in Jakarta. Clean white walls and machines that beeped in the night. Seven of every hundred mothers got their babies cut from them there. In the villages it was two. Numbers that told a story of who lived and who died based on nothing more than where they drew their first breath.\n\nThe poor died more. Always had. Twenty-seven percent more of them never saw inside a hospital than the rich. Money was the difference between life and death and it always had been. Some things dont change even when the world tries to make them change.\n\nThey talked about programs. About targeting specific problems like a hunter sighting down a rifle barrel. Quick fixes and immediate results that looked good on paper. But he knew better. Had seen what happened when you built one thing up while letting everything else crumble. Like trying to prop up one wall of a burning house. The whole thing would come down eventually. Always did.\n\nHe looked at the boy again. The boy was studying the charts with those solemn eyes of his. Papa, he said. Why dont they fix all of it.\n\nBecause son. Sometimes the simplest answer is the hardest one to see.",
            "The music they called Popular had growed and spread like some dark vine across a hundred years til a man couldnt name all its branches anymore. Each limb of it birthing new ones. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk and others nameless and strange. Like some ancient tree whose roots ran deep into the black soil of time. And from these roots come Heavy Metal, forty years past, spreading like wildfire through the musical wasteland. A thing built of darkness and rage but containing multitudes. Raw emotions stripped bare and bleeding. Men saw its power and took to shaping it like hot iron, hammering out new forms til the original shape was lost to memory.\n\nNow the metal stands transformed, a thousand faces staring back from the dark. A thing that feeds on other music like some desperate creature, taking what it needs, leaving the rest to rot. To know its true nature you got to go back. Back to where it began. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal dwells in darkness like some cave-thing. Always wanting more. More thunder in the bass, more violence in the sound, more theater in the spectacle. These weren't no primitive players neither. These were men who knew their tools like a hunter knows his knife. And there was the drugs too, coursing through it all like poison in the blood. Mid-seventies when the psychedelics hit hard and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like something born in fever dreams. It carried things in it that other music wouldn't touch. Dark things. Visceral things. Things that reached back to them old Romantic composers who knew about darkness too. The kind of darkness that makes a man write words like these here below, though the paper they was writ on is long since ashes.\n\nThem Beatles, they wrote Helter Skelter trying to outdo the Stones. Show em they could walk in darkness too. Some say it was the first real Metal song, though such things aint easy to reckon. A song about going up and down, about losing your mind to them pills and powders. They put it on that white album like a black mark on a clean sheet.",
            "In the time before the dreamers came with their wild paintings there was another who walked alone. Rousseau was his name and he crafted visions that came to him in the deep of night, both real and imagined. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, and in it lay not just some woman lost in wonderment at the strange country round her but Rousseau's own yearnings that gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition he sought. Acceptance too. These things burned in him while he walked the path between what others wanted and what his hands knew to do.\n\nHe was born in a place called Laval where the wind comes hard off the northwest coast of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware and they didnt starve. No teachers showed him the way of art. He worked for the government collecting tolls till he was forty years gone from his birth, though some called him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Only Julia lived. The grief sat in him like stone and he took up the brush hoping it might wash clean what was stained.\n\nHe painted different from the others who made pretty pictures of country folk. He painted true because he was of them. Common blood. Common dreams.\n\nThe art world was a beast he could not tame. Started late with no learning and worked alongside men who'd mastered the craft in their youth. Matisse was rising then, but they were different sorts entirely. Matisse feared the common way of painting like it was death itself while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make something so right and proper that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy to men who walk alone.",
            "He sat there thinking on them things that men before him had thought on. Ethics and beauty and how they was bound together like flesh to bone. Old Keats had wrote it down plain as day on that grecian urn of his. Beauty is truth and truth beauty and that was all there was to know in this world. Most everything a man learns comes by way of books or hard living but these things was different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how describing beauty or goodness was like trying to catch smoke in your hands. You could talk about the Mona Lisa's shadows or the way the background stretched away behind her like something from a fever dream but that wasnt it. That wasnt what made it beautiful. Folk would always say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Like they knew the words wasnt enough.\n\nHe remembered what that woman O'Connor had said about stories. How they was meant to say things that couldn't be said no other way. Like they was carrying something bigger than words. Something that lived in the spaces between em. And he reckoned it was the same with right and wrong. That writer Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics couldn't be spoke of proper cause they was beyond speaking.\n\nThe connection twixt the two of them, art and morals, it lived in that place you couldn't quite reach. Like trying to remember a dream that slips away soon as you wake. The deeper truth of it all existed somewhere past what a man could put into words. Literature carried it strongest of all the arts cause it dealt in the currency of life itself. Values and choices and the hard paths men walk. The things that make us human in this godless world.\n\nHe watched the sun sink below the horizon, painting the sky in colors that no artist could capture. Thought about how some truths cant be spoke, only felt in the marrow of your bones. How beauty and goodness was like that. Beyond telling. Beyond knowing. Just there, waiting to be found by them that had eyes to see.",
            "The land lay ancient and cold beneath the alpine shadows stretching north like some great beast's spine from München to the dark waters of the Baltic where Kiel stood sentinel against the gray horizon. The old ways persisted here like blood in the earth, seeping through the stones of Köln where the Rhine carved its path and eastward through Saxon country where Dresden brooded by the Elbe's sluggish waters. This was Germania.\n\nThey called it different names in the old tongue. Some said it came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine in times before memory, when the world was younger and the gods walked closer to men. Caesar knew them. Wrote of them in his accounts of blood and conquest, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Rome's heel. The Germans remained untamed, wild things that lurked beyond the river's far bank, emerging in the night with spears they called ger, their war-cries splitting the darkness like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote of them too, scratching his observations onto parchment while Rome's streets baked under Mediterranean sun. He saw them as creatures of the soil, born from the earth itself, unmixed with foreign blood. Who would choose such a place, he wondered. Who would abandon warm southern climes for this raw country with its sullen skies and forests that whispered old secrets in tongues no Roman could comprehend.\n\nThe Romans came nonetheless, drawn by amber and fur and things that glittered in the ground. They built their roads and fortresses but never stayed, always returning to their marble columns and heated baths, leaving Germania to its shadows. The tribes remained, trading their forest-wealth for Roman coin, sending their young men to march beneath imperial eagles while their true gods waited patient in the deep woods, knowing Rome's time would pass like all things must, while Germania endured, eternal as the stones.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some ancient tapestry gone yellow with age, threads bare in places where time has gnawed at the fabric. Deception lies at its heart, a dark and necessary thing, like a knife kept ready against the wolves. But there is a cost to wearing masks and the soul knows this cost even if the mind does not. The self becomes a stranger in its own skin and must one day choose between preservation and the bonds that tie it to others. Some will forgive the lie. Others will carry it like a wound that never heals.\n\nWhen the mask is one of gender it cuts deeper still. The question hangs in the air like smoke - why would one abandon the shelter of their own flesh? For Viola it was survival pure and simple. The words fall from her lips like stones: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" She speaks of preservation but what is preserved is merely the body while the spirit wanders lost in the wilderness of pretense.\n\nThe deception works its dark magic but leaves her cut off from her own kind, adrift in a world of women who cannot know her. And Olivia, poor Olivia, sees in her the ghost of Sebastian and loves what is not there: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words echo hollow in the empty air. Even Orsino carries the weight of unspoken desire: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nTo modern eyes the play might seem to speak of hidden hungers, of desires that dare not speak their names. Olivia and Orsino move through their scenes like sleepwalkers, their true hearts masked even from themselves. But perhaps Shakespeare saw deeper still, saw how Olivia's quick transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian marked her as one who loved with her eyes alone, as if the heart could be fooled by mere appearance. At the last she names Viola sister - \"A sister, you are she\" - and in those words lies both acceptance and forgiveness, as if the truth, once spoken, could wash clean all that came before.",
            "They called it German rule but there was nothing German about the blood. Blood speaks its own tongue and the Herero and Nama knew it well when the Germans came with their rifles and their orders and their need to plant flags in foreign soil. The land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nIn the east they built schools. Built them like they meant something. Like knowledge could bridge what guns had sundered. The British found them there when they came. Found the africans who could read and write and cipher numbers. Found them in Tanganyika and in Kamerun too. But in the southwest there was nothing. Nothing but missionaries wandering like pilgrims through the wasteland spreading their word to empty air while the government watched and did nothing.\n\nThe whites got their schools though. Got them built proper with government coin. Got their children taught proper too while the natives watched from beyond the windows, their faces pressed against glass that showed them nothing but their own reflection. Most never learned to read. Most never learned to write. Most just learned to survive.\n\nThe southwest was different. Different in ways that spoke of deeper things. Of older things. Things that lived in the hearts of men who came to plant their flags and spread their seed. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand strong. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their conquered realm. The climate suited them they said. Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right for making something of their own. Something that would last.\n\nBut the land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nThey wrote about it later. Wrote about it in German first then English. Wrote about how different it was from place to place. Territory to territory. How the schools worked here but not there. How the teaching took root in some soil but not in others. They had their reasons. Their explanations. Their theories written in neat lines on clean paper. But paper burns and ink fades and in the end there is only the land and what it remembers.",
            "They stood at the border, these two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide that stretched fifty-seven years deep into time. From 1836 to 1893 they circled and prowled, the United States and Mexico, their rivalry carved into the very bones of the earth. The war came in 1846 like some dark tide rising, Americans moving south with their rifles and their god, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in blood and dust and gunsmoke.\n\nThe border between them was a thing alive, a serpentine line drawn in sand and stone where cultures ground against each other like tectonic plates. Religion stood between them like a wall. Protestant and Catholic, each carrying the ghosts of old world hatreds in their veins, the English and Spanish dead whispering ancient grievances into living ears.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those years, most often over the borderlands where outlaws and brigands moved like wraiths through the desert night. Raiders crossed back and forth, leaving destruction in their wake until both nations sent their armies to stand watch in the wastes. The border towns existed in a kind of twilight, neither here nor there, where a man might wake to find himself in one country or another depending on which way the wind had blown the sand that night.\n\nThe rivalry was a living thing until it wasn't. Like some great beast lying down to die, it faded as Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor. The United States no longer looked to the land with hungry eyes but turned its gaze to money and markets. The old hatreds didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledgers instead of bodies.\n\nThey share that border still, these two nations, though the nature of their dance has changed. The ghosts of old conflicts walk those lands yet, their footprints hidden beneath the shifting sands of time, waiting for those who know where to look. In the end it was not god or guns that bridged the divide but the cold arithmetic of commerce, turning blood-soaked earth into columns of numbers, transforming ancient enmity into profit and loss.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety that came from having none as a child. They'd all say it - you'll always find work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing trade though it wasn't what my heart wanted.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone, nothing saved, and the work gone from me like smoke. Still am broken, these fifteen years later. Living on government handouts has stripped me bare. Everything I once called mine is gone now. Each day's a battle against the void, against the feeling of being less than whole. Nothing's certain anymore except one truth that burns like a coal in the dark - I wouldn't have survived without my people. Family. The few friends who stayed. When the real darkness comes you learn quick how weak you really are.\n\nThat's the thing about catastrophe. It comes without warning. No matter how you shore up against it, some storms are too big to weather alone. Like them old pioneers crossing the mountains. Conservatives preach about going it alone but that ain't how the wagons made it west. It was sharing. Looking out. Helping hands in the night.\n\nSo yes, lay in your stores. I got mine - medical supplies, water tablets, tape for the windows against whatever poison might come on the wind. Flashlights. Batteries. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods lined up like soldiers. Plant your garden if you got the land. Stack your wood if you got a stove to burn it.\n\nBut while you're preparing for the end of things, know your neighbors. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't rugged independence that'll save us. It's the light we keep burning for each other.",
            "In the old world, before the steel and concrete rose up to mock the heavens, there lived a prince. They would later call him Buddha though that wasnt his name then. None knew what would come. He cast off the gilded chains of his station like a snake shedding its skin and walked into the wastes of the world until enlightenment found him or he found it, who could say. What he taught became Buddhism and the Theravada sect claimed to hold closest to his words, though who could know after twenty five hundred years of men's tongues wagging and their minds forgetting.\n\nIn Sri Lanka they cut the water now. Some ceremony the Buddha never spoke of. Monks in their saffron robes and the common folk too, gathering like pilgrims at some ancient well. The faith had changed like everything changes, wearing smooth like river stones beneath the endless flow of time. The guardians of the old ways, both robed and common, had bent like reeds in the wind, doctrine twisting and reshaping itself against forces from within and without. Some came with fire and sword, others with mere indifference, each leaving their mark like the tide leaves its mark upon the shore.\n\nThey spoke of internal forces and external ones as if such things could be parsed clean like butchered meat. Internal meant those who claimed the Buddha's way as their own, external meant all others though such divisions meant little in the end. Then there were those who came meaning harm and those who meant nothing at all, though harm or help might follow in their wake like carrion birds following a war party.\n\nAt the heart of it lay the triple gem they sought refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma held in three baskets of ancient words: the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its rules, the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of things. They spoke of Anatta - the absence of soul, Dukkha - the suffering that clings to life like smoke to clothing, Anicca - how nothing lasts, nothing stays, everything crumbles to dust in time. Only by seeing these truths could one break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and rebirth grinding on and on like some cosmic mill wheel. Then would end the holy trinity of man's afflictions: desire, hatred, delusion. The rules came after, five for common folk - no killing, no lying, no stealing, no rutting like beasts, no drowning sense in drink or smoke. More rules for the monks, though rules were just words and words were wind.\n\nFour noble truths stood at the center like stone pillars in a temple: that life was suffering, that wanting caused the suffering, that suffering could end. These were the bones everything else was built upon."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture moves through the world like a ghost in the dark, unseen but felt, undefined yet bearing down upon all things. The negotiator knows this truth deep in his bones though he may not speak it. He knows too that culture aint no single thing that can be caught and held in the hand like some creature of flesh and blood. It moves through men like wind through dead trees.\n\nThe old ones would tell you that all Russians are this way or all Japanese are that way but they were wrong and had been wrong a long time. A man who sets to bargaining across borders would do well to know the weight of culture bearing down upon the table where the deals are made. When he looks upon foreign ways he sees them through eyes colored by his own raising, like looking through glass stained with the mud of home.\n\nTo know another man's culture is to walk in the tracks he's left behind. Study the history written in blood and bone. Accept the prejudices that run deep as groundwater. A negotiator who comes to foreign soil bearing a weak hand must bend like a reed in the wind, must take what he finds and work within its bounds. There aint no changing what centuries have built.\n\nCorporate culture rises up like kingdoms within kingdoms. Some outfits work their people like slaves to the lash while others let them run loose as wild horses. You can read it in how they dress and how they talk, whether they speak straight or crooked, whether they give to the poor or hoard their gold. Even in America where men claim to be free these kingdoms flourish, different as day and night though they share the same soil.\n\nValues run deeper than a dry well. They tell you why a man does what he does, why he'll die before shaming his people or why he'll fight tooth and nail over copper pennies. A smart negotiator learns these things before he ever sets foot in the room where the deals are made. But knowing the lay of the land aint enough. He must know the man across the table like he knows his own brother, must read the truth in his eyes and the lies in his smile. That's the only way to walk out whole.",
            "He sat there in the dim light reading the words again. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. Words from an old book. Ancient words. Words that Anselm had known and Aquinas too and now here they were again like smoke rising from dead fires.\n\nThey were both of them looking for the same thing. God. The God of scripture and testament. Not some other god dreamed up in the minds of lesser men but the true God if there was such. To speak of other gods would muddy the waters and that wouldnt serve. No. Better to stay the course they'd set. Even if neither one had found the whole of it.\n\nAnselm had his way of thinking. Said that God lived in the understanding like blood in the veins. That you could no more think him out of existence than you could think yourself out of breathing. Complex geometries of thought laid out in dead languages. But what it came to was this: that the truth of God was in you already like a thing you'd known but forgot you knew. Didnt need no evidence. Didnt need no proof. Just faith. Dark and deep as wells.\n\nBut Aquinas. He was different. Said you could prove God like you could prove fire makes smoke. Through reason. Through the hard facts of the world. Would have been a fine thing for spreading the word. Converting the heathens. No need to take nothing on faith when you could show em plain as day. He had five ways of proving it. Change and cause and necessity. Excellence and the harmony of things. Like looking at a puzzle with one piece gone. You dont need to see the missing piece to know what shape it is. The emptiness tells you. The absence.\n\nHe looked at the words again. The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. Ancient and terrible words. True maybe. But neither one of them had got to the heart of it. Not really. Not in full. The truth was bigger than their proofs and darker than their faith and it was still out there waiting. Like something crouched in the dark of the world. Watching. Patient as stones.",
            "Colors speak their own tongue in this world and some men know how to wield them better than others. Fitzgerald was such a man. In that book of his about Gatsby he done something peculiar with the way he painted his world. Like a man who'd found some old photographs bleached by the sun and knew there was truth hidden in their fading. He'd take words that had no business being together and marry them up like some demented preacher. Then he'd grab hold of a color like it was something living and breathing and hed make it mean what he wanted it to mean. Gold and green and white and gray and that bloodstained pink. All of them carrying their own weight like pallbearers at the funeral of meaning.\n\nThe white and gray especially. They was like twins born of different mothers. White being the child raised in them fine houses with silver spoons while gray was the bastard cousin left to scratch in the dirt. Fitzgerald he understood this. Every damn page dripping with white like fresh paint. Daisy and that Jordan girl forever wrapped in white like ghosts haunting the edges of the story. Even Nick with his white flannels and Tom in his white shirt like they was all trying to outshine each other in some godless parade. Only time the white gave way was at them parties Gatsby threw where the colors screamed like heathens in a church.\n\nHe painted his world white and gray like a man possessed. The canyons of New York white as bone. Them party people's names gone gray as week-old newsprint. Apartment buildings stacked like slices of some endless white cake that nobody'd ever eat. The people themselves wasn't spared neither. Jordan and Daisy with their white childhood like it was something pure when it wasnt. That valley of ashes with its gray cars and gray land stretching out like some biblical wasteland. Even the people there, that Italian child and the old dog-seller, gray as cemetery stones.\n\nThen when he'd loaded them colors up with all the meaning they could bear he turned them loose like weapons. Used them to strip away what was real from what wasnt. Take Daisy. She comes floating back into the story dressed in white, driving that white car like some kind of pale angel. But there wasnt nothing angelic about her. She was just something Gatsby wanted. Something he thought he could possess like you might possess a fine watch or a new suit. That gray fur collar around her neck like a noose. White dress before the showdown with Tom like she was trying to prove something that couldn't never be proved.\n\nThats what colors do in the hands of someone who knows their power. They tell truths that words alone cant tell.",
            "The county lay blessed by sun and mild days, a thing rare in this world. Fields stretched endless with tomatoes blood red against the earth and citrus trees bent heavy with fruit and the green leaves of countless crops reaching toward heaven. Squash and broccoli and herbs. Peaches soft as a babe's cheek. Lemons yellow as beaten gold. The berries dark and glistening like beads of blood. Honey sweet as sin in glass jars clouded with age.\n\nThey called it organic farming and folk would wait months just to taste of it. Eggs and milk pure as they'd been since time was young. Sometimes they'd let people walk the land. Watch the birds. See how things was done. Government men would come too with their papers and their promises, talking about programs and benefits and such.\n\nThe land remembered things. Remembered the old ones who'd walked it first. Their footsteps in the dirt like scripture writ in sand. Then came the cattlemen with their herds and the woodcutters with their saws. The land remembered them too.\n\nA hundred and sixty acres it was, pressed up against Cleveland Forest like a child against its mother's breast. Chaparral and grass that didn't belong and oak trees old as sin. The creatures lived there still. Kangaroo rats and yellow-legged frogs and butterflies that danced like spirits in the morning light. The gnatcatcher too, though fewer now than before. Burrowing owls watching with eyes like amber coins.\n\nBut the farming wasn't easy. No chemicals to kill the weeds or the things that ate at the crops. Everything done by hand like in the old days. More work. More loss. The big farms had their machines and their poisons but here they did it different. Let the land breathe. Let it live. Planted cover crops and moved the cattle like chessmen on a board. Fought the plants that didn't belong. Sometimes a man would look at his ledger and see red like blood on the page. That's when he'd need help. Help from men in offices with their programs and their promises. Help to keep the land alive and still put food on his own table.\n\nThat's how it was in this corner of the world. That's how it had to be.",
            "Brothers carry a bond that runs deeper than blood. A thing that cant be broke nor bent nor burned away. Inside that bond dwells love and pride and jealousy and cruelty and all manner of darkness that men carry in their hearts. Brothers know each other in ways that others cant. When they look upon each other they see themselves reflected back like some dark mirror in a forgotten place. And when the world turns cold and mean thats when the true nature of brotherhood shows itself whether it be good or evil. But such knowledge carries with it a terrible cost.\n\nThe boy called Doodle and his brother lived out their days in that lush southern land where the heat lay like a wet blanket and the air was thick enough to drown in. Pride was the brothers constant companion. It rode him like a demon. He'd wanted someone to race with through Old Woman Swamp and to climb the twisted vines that hung there like the beards of dead prophets. Someone to swim with to Horsehead Landing. Someone to perch with him in the highest fork of the ancient pine that stood sentinel behind their barn. But Doodle wasnt made for such things.\n\nThe younger brother had come into the world with a heart that beat wrong. Like some broken timepiece marking hours that didnt exist. The doctors said he wouldnt live and if he did hed never run nor jump nor swim like other boys. And this knowledge ate at the older brother like poison. He remembered nights studying the small bundle in the crib and thinking dark thoughts about pillows and silence and how easy it would be. But then Doodle smiled at him one day and that smile carried in it something pure and true that burned away the darkness in his heart. At least for a time.\n\nTheir final journey together was marked by thunder and lightning and rain that fell in gray sheets. Pride and disappointment warred in the brothers heart like ancient enemies and in the end only one of them would walk away from that place. Only one would carry the memory of what happened there in the storm and the mud and the crushing weight of what brotherhood truly means.",
            "The mind of man aint nothing if not a dark and tangled wilderness. Time was men thought it simple as marks pressed in wax or words writ upon papyrus sheets but they was wrong about that. Wrong as they was about most things. These days they speak of computers and circuits but even that aint the truth of it. The truth dont live in metaphors.\n\nThe world comes at you raw and brutal. Light and sound and heat all hammering at the gates of your skull like armies of the damned. Your brain takes these things, these messengers from whatever godless country lies beyond, and turns them into something else entirely. Something electric. Something alive.\n\nIt works two ways, they say. Bottom up and top down like the movement of vultures circling some dead thing in the desert. When your eyes light upon a black shape against white it aint just the borders and the colors that tell you what it is. Your mind already knows boxes. Knows them deep down in whatever primitive hollow such knowing resides.\n\nThere's a filter too. Some ancient mechanism that sorts what matters from what dont. Like how you might hear your name called across a crowded room full of nothing but noise and darkness. Your brain processes every blade of grass you ever laid eyes on but that filter, if it works right, keeps you from going mad with the knowing of them.\n\nMemory aint one thing but many. Short and long, sensory and working, all of them different as blood is from bone. Words get stored different ways - by their shape or their sound or their meaning. Some memories, they say, are nothing but electricity running circles through your head like them horses in a desert carnival. Others get pressed into the very proteins of your brain, folded up and put away like old letters in a trunk.\n\nThey got models for how all this knowledge gets stored. Scientists and their theories, each one different as the next, all of them probably wrong in their own particular way. One says its like a web, with every piece connected to every other piece. Chair connected to table connected to wood and on and on until everything in the whole world is somehow kin to everything else. But who can say if thats the truth of it. The mind keeps its own counsel and gives up its secrets slow, if it gives them up at all.",
            "The money died in 2007. It died slow and it died hard and when it was done dying there wasnt much left of anything at all. Men stood in lines stretching round buildings like great gray serpents, waiting for work that wasnt there. Houses empty. Banks fallen. The greatest of corporate beasts laid low in the dust and ash of their own making.\n\nThe seeds of it were sown in the time of Clinton. He who would be king twice over sought the love of the masses and in doing so loosened the chains that held the money-men in check. A scribe named Holmes wrote of it in the Times. Wrote of how Fannie Mae, that great beast of mortgage and loan, was pressed by men in suits to give money to those who had none. To maintain its hunger for profit. Holmes saw what was coming like a prophet in the waste. Saw the government would have to reach down with its cold hand and save what was left, same as they done before with the savings and loans in the eighties.\n\nThey made new kinds of money then. Strange words for strange things. Adjustable-rate mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized debt obligations. Words that meant nothing and everything. Like incantations. Like prayers to dead gods. The money-men wove these things together till you couldnt tell where one ended and another began. Till the whole country was caught in this web of debt and promise.\n\nWhen it broke it broke hard. The five great houses of investment banking stood with four trillion in debt, near a third of all the nation's worth. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies. Lehman Brothers died in the street. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley survived but were changed, made to wear the chains of regulation like penitents. Fannie and Freddie, five trillion in debt between them, became wards of the state in the ninth month of 2008. The government took them in like orphans. Like foundlings. But they were not innocent.",
            "The words lay dead on the page like bones bleached in desert sun. No life in them. No blood neither. Just facts piled on facts like the stacked cordwood he'd seen as a boy, waiting for the fire that would consume them all.\n\nHe studied the page before him. The way of telling tales aint to tell them at all, his father had said once. Show em the truth of things. The weight and heft. Let em feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.\n\nHe thought about exposition. That dark and nameless thing that crept into stories like a thief. Stealing life from words. Draining the blood from tales that ought to pulse with it. Making dead things of living stories.\n\nThere was a right way and a wrong way and the difference twixt them was vast as the space between stars. You could say a man was Air Force once and managed a gas station nights and married twice with no young ones to show for it and dreamed of owning that station someday. You could say all that. But it wouldn't show the way his hands still moved like he was touching sky when he walked the empty forecourt at midnight. Wouldn't show how he touched the wedding band he still wore like it was both blessing and curse. Wouldn't show how his eyes went distant when cars pulled in trailing highway dust, like maybe one day it'd be someone he knew from back then. Back when he flew. When he was something else entirely.\n\nThe telling of tales was like breaking wild horses. You couldn't rush it. Couldn't force it. Had to let it come natural as breathing. Had to let the story find its own way home.\n\nHe looked at the words again. Dead things. No pulse in them. No breath neither. He'd have to start over. Show the truth of things. The weight and the heft. Let them feel the raw heart of it beating in their hands.",
            "He watched the screen flicker in the dark of morning, the news from Columbus casting its pale glow across the room. August thirteenth two thousand and eleven. First came word of Ashley where a man named Hostettler had done his wife with a knife. They showed his face, a darkness in it like something youd see in an old daguerreotype of a murderer. Evil plain as day. Two minutes worth and done.\n\nThen the boy Travis Buyers, eighteen years on this earth and now shot down in Sharon Woods. Critical they said. No arrests. SWAT teams moving through the streets like black beetles. Brief telling, too brief maybe, like they didnt care much for stories about colored folk getting shot. Been that way long as he could reckon. White child goes missing they sound all the bells in christendom but let it be someone with dark skin and silence falls like ash.\n\nWord came of a bullet hole found in one of them flying ambulances. Twenty-two caliber they said. Rifle shot. Money offered for the shooter, five thousand dollars worth of thirty pieces of silver.\n\nWeather man stood there in his suit talking about rain coming. Thunder too. Heat holding in the eighties like it was afraid to leave. Quick tell, wanting folks to stay put and watch more.\n\nThen the UDF robbery down on Clime Road. Dark skinned man they said, wearing a hood like death himself. Six foot tall and lean as a fence post. They went on about his blackness like it was all that mattered in gods creation.\n\nLast came the tale of Rodriguez, some drug lord from Texas moving weed up north like it was cotton in the old days. Three hundred months they gave him. Not twenty-five years mind you but three hundred months like they was counting out each one special. Made sure to say he was Hispanic too, though what bearing that had on anything he couldnt figure. World's got its own way of marking people, he reckoned, whether they ask for it or not.",
            "He sat there studying the papers before him, numbers swimming like black minnows in a dark pool. ETF they called it. Exchange traded fund. Words that meant nothing to the dead world outside but here in this room they held some power still, some echo of the old times when men traded paper for promises and promises for gold.\n\nThe figures lay stark against the white sheets. Cold numbers telling cold truths about money and worth and things that no longer existed except in the minds of those who remembered. Ten holdings they showed, top ones they said, making up near sixty-four percent of what they called assets. Assets. As if anything could be held fast in this world.\n\nHe thought about diversification. A word from the old world. Like spreading seed across many fields instead of one, hoping some would take root and grow while others withered. The numbers showed it plain as day. The ten-stock portfolio running higher than its parent fund by six point eleven percent. A ghost of better returns haunting the pages. Beta lower by point twelve. Numbers that meant something once, when men still believed in such things.\n\nStandard deviations lined up like prisoners against a wall. Each stock contributing its measure of risk, its portion of uncertainty to the whole. Statistical significance. As if statistics could capture the true nature of risk in a world where everything had already been lost.\n\nThe charts stretched out before him like a map of some dead country. IHF they called it, letters that once meant something to someone. Now just marks on paper, telling tales of holdings and returns and measures of things that no longer mattered. Yet he studied them still, like a man reading ancient runes, searching for meaning in the ashes of the financial world.\n\nHe thought about the old days when men spoke of sharp ratios and optimal returns. When they believed they could measure risk against reward and find some perfect balance between the two. But he knew better now. Knew that all portfolios, all investments, all carefully laid plans were just dust in the wind. Yet still he ran the numbers. Still he searched for patterns in the chaos. Because that's what men do. They search for order even when they know there is none to be found.",
            "The numbers fell away like dying leaves in that third month. Figure 17 told the tale plain enough and there was no hiding from it. The logs dried up and blew away on the winter wind that swept across that New England campus, taking with it the bicycle riders and the footbound travelers alike. December it was, when the semester draws its last rasping breath and the people scatter to their tasks like blown ash. Grading and schoolwork consuming them whole. The commuter logs forgotten like old photographs in a drawer.\n\nThe holiday season came down on them like a shroud. Students and teachers alike vanished into that monthlong darkness, the campus standing empty and cold as a dead church. When they returned in the late January thaw the numbers stayed low, dried up, a riverbed in drought. February brought no relief and none could say why. Perhaps it was the nature of such things, the way fire burns bright then dims to coals and finally to nothing but gray dust. They created what they called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a desperate flare in the dark, and it drew some back like moths but not enough. Never enough.\n\nThey were up against something older than winter, deeper than snow. The American love of the automobile ran in their blood like a fever. Freedom and motion, the wide empty road calling. You could offer a man alternatives but you couldn't make him choose them. They tried with prizes - gift cards for food and drink, for books and comforts. But perhaps they should have gone bigger. A bicycle maybe. Or one of them hybrid cars that run quiet as ghosts. Could have parceled them out slow, like bait. Let the prizes grow month by month until they had something worth killing for. Might have kept them interested. Might have kept them coming back. But they'd never know now. The past was the past and it was written in stone and ash.",
            "He sat there in the dim light of the archive room watching them flicker across the screen one by one, these old Edison pictures, these trick films from the dawn of moving pictures. Fifteen of them all told from 1895 to 1901. Strange ghosts dancing in the darkness, illusions wrought by men long dead who'd spliced together strips of celluloid like witch doctors working their magic.\n\nMost of them followed the old ways. Set-bound pictures they were, shot straight on like some demonic theatre stage, the camera bolted down and immovable as stone. No movement save what danced within the frame itself. Long shots and medium shots was all they knew then. One shot was all they got, one shot was all they needed. But there were others. Others that came later. Others that dared break these ancient laws.\n\nThe pictures shared a common blood. Interior sets all of them, framed like some godless proscenium arch where dark things happened. The camera stood mute witness, didnt follow nothing that moved within its gaze. Like vaudeville shows or magic acts, remnants of dead traditions carried forward into this new world. Figures moved sideways like crabs, never toward the glass eye that watched them. He thought of Uncle Josh in that spooky hotel, that old film from 1900. Josh moving back and forth like a prisoner in his cell, never closer, never further, trapped in that two-dimensional hell.\n\nThe way they framed it all kept everything at arms length. No close-ups in these demon reels. Theatre folk knew nothing else back then, showed everything at once like God himself watching from above. Actors stayed in their place like good tin soldiers, never daring approach the eye that watched them perform their strange rituals.\n\nMost followed the old rule - one shot one film. Brief little things they were, minute or less depending on how fast they cranked that handle. Not much story to tell in sixty seconds. Just tricks and magic and people appearing and vanishing like smoke. But even then they knew how to lie with pictures. He thought of Mary Queen of Scots, that film from 95. Watched close enough you could see where they stitched together the shots, where they worked their dark magic to make you believe they'd cut off her head right there before your eyes.\n\nThese were sorcerer's tools, these first moving pictures. Made by men who knew how to bend light and time to their will. Dead men now, all of them. But their ghosts still danced in the darkness, trapped forever in their silver cage, performing their tricks for empty rooms and forgotten dreams.",
            "The Gothic novel stands as both old and new, a thing caught between worlds like some ancient specter haunting modern halls. Some men praise it and some curse it and some say it has no depth at all while others speak of its terrible power to shake the soul. But they're all wrong and they're all right and that's the way of things.\n\nThe first of them was Walpole's Castle of Otranto. He took what was old and made it new again like some dark alchemist working with words instead of metal. The medieval ghosts and the modern ways of telling stories all mixed together in that cursed place he built with ink and paper. Gothic they called it then and Gothic they call it now though the word means something different to every man who speaks it. It was a thing out of time even then. Something that didn't belong. But that's what gave it power.\n\nThe old ways of chivalry run through these tales like black veins in marble. Knights and honor and all the things men once held dear but had forgotten. Walpole saw the world around him going dark and godless, the old virtues dying like leaves in winter, and he wrote of better times. Or what he thought were better times. Maybe they never were. But in his mind they stood like ancient towers against a blood-red sky.\n\nYou can see it clear as day in how he writes of Frederic. A prince who'd known suffering. A man who'd walked through fire and come out changed. They said the infidels had killed him but death ain't always what we think it is. He was everything a knight should be, everything Walpole thought the world had lost. But even then the writer knew he was painting with colors too bright for this world. Making something that couldn't exist no more, if it ever did.\n\nThat's what Gothic is. A dream of something lost. A nightmare of something coming. Both at once and neither one complete. Like watching shadows dance on cave walls and trying to say what makes them move.",
            "They called it supply chain management and it was a thing born of necessity in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two when a man named Oliver put words to what had always been. The moving of things through the world. Raw materials to finished goods. Production to customer. All of it connected like the bones of some great beast that stretched across the land.\n\nSix parts made up this beast. Production and supply. Inventory and location. Transportation and information. These were the things that men in suits would use to serve the nameless masses who waited in the dark for their goods.\n\nProduction came first like some terrible birth. It was the foundation stone. The bedrock. It determined the when and the where and the how of things made. Men who managed such things needed to know what the masses wanted and they looked to the market like seers reading entrails. The market never lied. It told them what to make and how many and where best to make them. They'd pick their plants careful. Looking for volume and quality like prophets seeking signs in the sky.\n\nHe remembered the stores where he'd worked. Walmart. Target. Each had their own scripture. Their own gospel of how things should be. Books that told a man how to dress. How to receive the great trucks that came in the night. It was all written down somewhere. Every detail accounted for like some industrial catechism.\n\nSupply came next. Strategic choices about what could be done inhouse and what needed other hands. Some products were like wandering souls passing through many bodies before they found their final form. Each stop needed different tools. Different skills. Sometimes they'd send the work away to other companies. Outsourcing they called it. A way to keep the velocity. Velocity was their god. The ability to move fast and bend like reeds while keeping the costs low. Always the costs. The numbers written in red in ledgers like the blood of some sacrificial thing.\n\nThey had made a religion of it all. A way to move things through the world that was as old as the first trade routes but now had new names. New prophets. New ways to count the cost of everything while knowing the value of nothing.",
            "They was different them Victorian books. All of them filled with their fancy details and lords and ladies and such but there was two that walked a darker path. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights they was called. Something deeper in them books. Something that crawled up out of the dark like some nightborn thing. Made the people in them stories more real somehow. More true.\n\nHe remembered the passage bout Oliver. The boy caught between Sikes and Crackit like some small creature trapped between two wolves. Words come at him like shots in the dark. Gunfire and shouts and lights all swirling round in his head while pain ate at him like some hungry thing that wouldnt die. Pain that followed him through the dark like a shadow.\n\nThe books they used dreams. Strange visions that come in the night showing what was real and what wasnt. In Oliver's tale these dreams showed what the boy really was inside. What ate at his soul. That shooting scene when it finally come round again in chapter 28 it showed how the boy had no control over nothing. Like a leaf in a river. The pain wasnt sharp no more but stretched out endless like the road ahead. Some unseen hand dragging him away into the dark.\n\nThe boy's defeat hung in the air like smoke. Old Fagin had broke something in him. Something that might not never be fixed. Time itself went strange. Day become night become day again. All of it bleeding together in the endless dark. No dawn. No hope. Just the silence eating away at everything until there wasnt nothing left but shadows and pain.",
            "There was a time I minded children at a school. After hours. Teaching them what little I knew. Reading mostly. English too. They sent me a boy called Adrian. Third grade maybe fourth. Something wasnt right with him. The letters on the page they meant nothing to him. Some he knew and others were foreign things. Dark eyes. Dark hair. Latino blood in him sure enough but he spoke English pure as rain.\n\nWe went on like that for a time. Then one day his mother came. The others had gone on a trip somewhere and I was watching the ones left behind. She didnt speak no English. Not a word. Just Spanish soft and low like a prayer. My own Spanish was poor but we made do. That's when it hit me like a hammer blow. The boy could read fine enough. Just didnt know our letters is all. Whether that knowledge helped him any I cant say. I hope it did.\n\nI tell this tale because of what it means. Here in California we got children who cant read the tongue they speak in. Aint always clear as you might think. Even a child speaking English pure as spring water might stumble on the written word like it was stones in a creek bed. We all know the problem's there. Question is what to do about it. For Adrian it wasnt so hard. Just needed teaching in the English way of letters. But for them that barely speak English at all its harder. Aint no single answer neither. Dual language. Immersion. Private teaching. ESL. None of these alone will fix what's broke. Got to put them all together like pieces of a broken plate.\n\nThe dual language way it's good. Not just for Spanish speakers neither but for all of them. Studies show these children do better than the rest. Some folks fear it. Say it's wasteful. Say most children won't get nothing from it. That aint true. If we was to make it the rule instead of the exception every child would grow stronger for it. But how to do it? Make all teachers speak both tongues? No. That aint possible. But we could have helpers. Special ones who know both languages. Like bridges between two worlds.",
            "From when we're young they tell us there's somethin bigger than us out there in the dark. Somethin we cant wrap our minds around no matter how hard we try. They send you off to learn about it in buildings made of wood and stone where the light comes in through colored glass and makes shapes on the floor like old ghosts. Some take to it natural like breathin while others fight against it like its a tide trying to pull them under. Either way we're all searchin for something to light our way through the dark of this world.\n\nMy daddy told me once it was cardinals he liked best. We was sittin on the porch, him and me, smokin cigarettes and listenin to the rain beat down on that old tin roof like God himself was throwin stones. The gutters was overflowin, water pourin down like some biblical flood meant to wash everything clean. Daddy just sat there starin out into the gray waste of that evenin, his clothes hangin off him like they belonged to some bigger man who'd gone away and left them behind. His hair had gone thin too, like time itself was erasin him bit by bit. Neither of us said nothin about what was comin. Sometimes words just make things more real than they ought to be. I moved my chair closer to his and we both watched the rain fall in the fadin light.\n\nHe died in December that year. Five days after I turned twenty-two. They'd pumped him full of poison to kill the thing that was killin him but all it did was make him suffer longer. I lay in my bed at night wonderin what kind of God would do such a thing. I didnt pray. If there was a God up there he'd stopped listenin to folks like us a long time ago.\n\nI didnt go to watch him die. Couldnt. The life that made me was endin and I couldnt bear to see it go. I wanted to remember him like he was that day on the porch, still whole enough to smoke a cigarette and talk about birds. I knew him better than any of them did and he wouldnt have wanted his boy watchin him slip away into whatever darkness was waitin for him. So I curled up in my bed like some wounded animal and waited for word that he was gone.\n\nNobody even called to tell me when it happened. Like he just disappeared into that gray rain we'd watched together, leaving nothing behind but smoke and memory.",
            "He came in the night to write of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who held fast to the old Republican ways like a drowning man clutches at floating timber. Taylor was a farmer first and foremost and it was the dirt and the growing things that shaped him into what he would become. The land spoke to him of freedom and sovereignty and justice and he listened well.\n\nThe new nation lay before him raw and unmolded, like clay waiting for the potter's hands. No ancient customs to bind them, no dead kings' laws to chain their thoughts. Taylor saw in this emptiness a terrible beauty. He knew that the rights of men were like bones in a body, break one and the whole form fails, weaken one and all grow dim. These things must stay beyond the reach of any government's grasp.\n\nHe spoke often of man's nature, how it carried both light and dark like twin seeds waiting to sprout. The government must account for both, he said, must be built knowing the truth of what lay in men's hearts. Good principles protect what a man owns, let him work his land, keep the moneylenders at bay. But even good principles cant wash clean what dwells in the souls of those who govern. Self-interest moves in all men like blood in their veins, he said, and its only evil when it feeds off others like a parasite.\n\nThe Constitution to Taylor was like scripture that must be read true and careful. He wanted the Federal government small and contained, like a fire in a hearth that warms but doesn't burn the house down. He knew that power and money flow together like twin rivers and both can drown a nation. But words alone weren't enough, he said. You had to know the mind of the men who wrote them. The Declaration was his true north star, showing separate sovereign states instead of one great beast.\n\nHe believed in these things with a fervor that burned cold and steady, like stars in a winter sky. The agrarian way was his religion and the land was his church and he preached its gospel until his last breath.",
            "He stood there watching the bowl. Silent. The mind working at it like some broken machine, grinding away at what lay before him but never quite catching hold. Thoughts came and went like ash on the wind. No purchase. No meaning. Just the looking.\n\nYears back hed bought him a book on account of what some artist told him. About drawing with the brain. Right side they called it though he didnt know why. Six years old and wanting to make pictures appear on paper like magic and now here was this book telling how to frame the world. How to section it off from all else. Like taking that bowl of fruit in someones kitchen and making it float there in space. Making it something else entirely.\n\nStanding there now he couldnt find that frame if his life depended on it. Too much. Far too much. He thought about them painters. Picasso with his blues. Monet in his gardens. Them Italian fellows with their colors bright as blood. If he was to make his mark in the world of art this here would be his beginning. His own personal brown period.\n\nHis fingers found the handle. Muscles pulled and twisted like something alive down in there. Water moving like glass. Clear and cold. Bits breaking off and floating away to nowhere. Second time harder. More violent. Handle cracking against the porcelain but that brown mass just sat there like something dead. Like something that had never been alive at all.\n\nHe stood there in his green tie that choked at his throat. Feet planted like a man about to take a blow. Mop loose in his grip while he studied that thing someone had left there in the Rite Aid toilet. Message written in the oldest language there was. He pulled at the paper. Wrapped his hand like a man wrapping a wound. Drew himself up straight then bent slow at the middle. Hand going down into that water like reaching into hell itself.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones. Not yet grown. The statistics tell their tale in cold numbers writ in blood upon the asphalt. The men in white coats at the National Institute speak of brains not yet ready, synapses still forming in the dark caverns of skull and bone. But there's more to it than that. More than just the rawness of youth and inexperience that sends them careening off the hardtop into darkness.\n\nHe'd seen them. Packs of them. Moving through the night in metal coffins, radio sounds bleeding into the darkness. The studies showed it plain as bones bleaching in the sun - more died when they traveled together. The Southern California men had counted the bodies, mapped the correlation between passenger age and metal twisted against concrete barriers.\n\nThe state men tried to stem the tide with paper laws. Provisional licenses they called them. Times when the young ones could drive and times when they couldn't. Rules about who could ride beside them in the night. But these were just words on paper, thin as ash.\n\nThe truth lay deeper. Cold and hard as winter ground. These children, these drivers barely grown, could not bear the weight of steel and speed. Even at eighteen, said the doctor man Zuckerman, the blood runs too hot. The need for speed and danger burns in them like fever. USA Today printed his words but nobody listened. Nobody wanted to hear that the children of the boom times were coming, millions strong, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe answer was simple as a blade. Keep them from the driver's seat till eighteen years had passed. Let the schools teach them in safety, behind desks and in lots where no blood could flow. Make them wait. Make them learn. Six hours behind the wheel with teachers watching. Fifty more with adults beside them. That's how they did it in California and it could work everywhere if the law men had the guts to make it so.\n\nHe thought about the dead ones. How they lay scattered across all the states like fallen leaves. How the numbers kept rising like flood waters in spring. This wasn't new thinking. Others had seen it too. But seeing wasn't enough. Never had been. Never would be.",
            "He sat at the desk studying the papers before him, documents speaking of a thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder. CAPD they called it. Like the names of dead gods or forgotten machines. Three parts to it there were. The definition and then the diagnosis and then what could be done in the classroom. As if anything could be done. As if anything could be done at all.\n\nThe disorder lived in the brain like some dark creature coiled in the deep folds of gray matter. Not in the ears themselves for they worked right enough but in the processing of the sounds themselves. The translation of them. As if the brain spoke one tongue and the ears another and somewhere in between the two languages had been lost. Like pilgrims wandering in some vast cavern with no light to guide them.\n\nThey'd found it first in the fifties. Italian doctors with names like prayers. Bocca. Calearo. Cassinari. They'd developed tests for the children who couldn't hear right even though their ears worked fine. Then Kimura came with his dichotic testing. Whatever that was. Whatever that meant in this world or any other.\n\nThe signs showed themselves like tracks in ash. A person couldn't tell where sounds came from in the room. Couldn't tell one sound from another or understand when someone's voice changed from serious to mocking. Like being trapped in a world where everything sounded the same. Everything merged together in a gray soup of noise.\n\nTo find it they had to test. Audiologists and psychologists watching like prophets of old trying to divine meaning from scattered bones. They'd give questionnaires and watch how people acted when sounds came at them. No single test could catch it. No one knew what caused it. They'd play sounds in both ears at once and ask what was heard. Like some cruel game. More complex tests measured signals in the ear itself but even these weren't certain. Nothing was certain anymore.\n\nHe looked up from the papers. Outside the window the world went on as it always had. Uncaring. Indifferent to the struggles of those who couldn't process its sounds properly. He wondered if they would ever truly understand it. If anyone would.",
            "The boy sat on her couch and he knew what the boy was runnin from. Seen it before. The kind of thing that makes the world what it is. Dark and cold and full of them that would do harm to their own blood. He watched the boy's hands shakin and thought about what kind of place this world had become where children flee from their own flesh.\n\nSummer had come and gone since the degree. Psychology. Words on paper that meant nothin when faced with the real darkness in mens souls. The boy had called the law and I went down there to that house. Dark windows like dead eyes watchin. Parents inside with their rehearsed stories and practiced faces. Talkin about simple disputes like evil was just some small thing you could sweep under a rug. Knew right then what I was meant to do in this world.\n\nSocial work aint just about helpin. Its about justice. About standin between the darkness and them that cant fight it alone. Seen too many souls crushed trying to fit into what others say they ought to be. Fought against it my whole life. Hair colored like poison flowers and metal in my ears past what folks thought proper. Stood with them that society said weren't right. Gay. Straight. Whatever name they gave themselves. All just souls trying to live in a world that dont want em different.\n\nWatched too many turn away. Too many denied what was real. But the darkness is there whether you look at it or not. Social work. Thats the path. To stand against the tide of pain that flows through families like poison in the blood. To help them that cant help themselves. These are the values burned into me like brands. Service. Respect. Ethics. All just words for doing what's right in a world gone wrong.\n\nBeen studyin people long enough to know that evil aint always what you think. Sometimes it wears a smile and makes excuses and calls itself love while it breaks everything it touches. But I know what I seen. Know what needs doin. And I aim to do it.",
            "They called it insomnia but that word was too clean for what it was. Sleep that wouldn't come. Sleep that danced away like smoke in the dark while a man lay watching the ceiling fade from black to gray to black again. The biological and the sociocultural, they said. Words to wrap around the darkness like bandages round a wound that wouldn't heal.\n\nThe biological was in the blood and the bone. Inherited like eye color or the shape of a man's hands. Deep in the hypothalamus neurons fired or didn't fire, containing something called orexin that nobody could see but that ruled over sleep and waking like some blind god. GABAB receptors. The words were meaningless but the truth of them was written in the flesh of laboratory mice, poor creatures trapped in mazes of glass and steel while men in white coats watched them dream or fail to dream.\n\nThey found that when you stopped these receptors from their firing the mice would sleep. Simple as that. But nothing was ever simple. The sociocultural they called it. The world outside pressing in. School and work and the endless tasks that filled the days. A man who couldn't sleep couldn't work. Couldn't think. Couldn't be what the world demanded.\n\nSleep disorders came in kinds. Primary disorders and those that rode piggyback on other afflictions of the mind. Dyssomnias they named them, and Parasomnias. More words to wrap around the darkness. Insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy. Sleep terrors that came in the night like wolves to tear at the mind. Nightmares that left a man sweating in sheets gone cold and damp as cemetery grass.\n\nThe truth was in the blood though. In the genes passed down from father to son like dark inheritance. In the neurons firing or not firing in the deep caves of the brain. In the mice dreaming their mouse dreams in laboratories where men sought answers in microscopes and chemical formulas. But answers were like sleep itself. The harder you chased them the faster they ran.",
            "Been here at University Park going on three years now. The getting around weighs heavy. That first year they put me in East Halls, far out as you could go less you counted the stadium standing stark against the gray Pennsylvania sky. The walk from Stuart Hall to classes in Willard, it took near half an hour some days, worse when the weather turned mean like it does in State College, cold and wet and godless.\n\nTalked once with someone who'd walked these grounds before. Said East Halls used to stand alone out there, nothing but empty land stretched between it and civilization like some forsaken outpost. Now sports fields spring up from the earth like grave markers. New buildings too. The Creamery. Health Services. Apartment complexes ring it all like prison walls. Campus grows like some mindless thing, consuming ground, making the distances longer, the walks harder.\n\nWhat's the answer to all this? The bicycle. Simple as that. But a bicycle alone aint worth nothing without riders and without ground fit for riding.\n\nMet a boy who'd taken back to riding after years away from it. Said he couldn't reckon why he'd ever stopped. \"Only way to get around,\" he said, and there was truth in those words. Bicycle'll take you thirty miles on nothing but a bowl of oatmeal and will. Living off campus now like most who've survived their first year. Bought myself a bike. Best decision I made since coming here. Thomas building's my daily destination, twenty-five minutes walking if you're lucky. On the bike it's five minutes if you're willing to push. Only trouble is Pollock Road. Straightest path there is but it aint friendly to riders nor walkers neither.\n\nWalking's got its merits sure enough but time aint one of them. Without the bike I'd be burning daylight, thirty, forty minutes extra each day just getting to Thomas. That's better than two hours every week lost to nothing but putting one foot before the other. Add in all the other wandering required by this life - classes, meetings, whatever else calls - and you're looking at time you can't afford to lose in this world.\n\nThe bike. That's the answer. Simple as that. But nothing's ever really simple, is it?",
            "He sat there in the dim light of his study, turning the pages of Huxley's prophecy. The words stark and cold upon the page like the bones of dead things. In the book there was a world gone wrong. A world where men had forgotten what it was to be men. Where they'd traded their souls for comfort and their minds for pleasure. He knew this truth deep in the marrow of his bones.\n\nThe World Controller stood above them all like some dark god. Watching. Always watching. The people below him moved like puppets on strings, dancing to music they couldn't hear, following paths they didn't choose. Each class marked and branded from birth, condemned to their station like prisoners in cells they couldn't see.\n\nThey called it conditioning but it was a deeper thing than that. A thing that reached into the very heart of what made a man human and tore it out still beating. The lower classes, the Deltas and Gammas, they moved through their days in a fog of false consciousness, believing the lies whispered into their sleeping minds since before they could walk. Buy, spend, consume. The words like a poison in their blood.\n\nThe upper classes weren't much better. Alphas and Betas with their fine clothes and their empty eyes. They knew the truth of their cage but they chose to stay inside it anyway. All except Bernard, who saw the bars for what they were but couldn't break them.\n\nLove was a dead thing in this world. The characters moved past each other like ghosts, never touching, never connecting. The men spoke of women like they were machines, all parts and functions. Pneumatic, they called them. The women talked of coupling like it was nothing more than scratching an itch. No depth to any of them. No soul.\n\nHe thought about how the classes stayed in their places, neat and ordered like graves in a cemetery. Each one believing they were better than the rest, while the World Controller watched from above and smiled his cold smile. The people consumed and obeyed and never questioned why, like cattle being led to slaughter but thinking they were going to paradise.\n\nThis was Huxley's warning, written in blood and shadow. A world where technology and money had stolen the heart from humanity. Where free will was just another commodity to be bought and sold. Where the individual had been sacrificed on the altar of the community, and no one even remembered what they'd lost.",
            "Four years past I set to learning of Islam at the college. The talk turned always to whether their faith bore violence in its heart. More pressing now than ever it seems, that question. Since the towers fell I watched how the papers and screens shifted like wind-blown ash from hatred to a peculiar kind of tolerance. Back then none would have believed a man called Barack Obama, with Muhammadan blood in his line, could seek the highest office in the land.\n\nThe Prophet's tale gnaws at me. What's writ of Muhammad stands contrary to what history speaks. I'd known him as a warlord who put the sword to men's throats till they spoke his creed. Yet here in these pages he's rendered a martyr, meek as a lamb, persecuted and patient while folk came to him one by one, drawn to his truth like moths to flame.\n\nThere's an echo in these pages that troubles me deep. His miracles mirror Christ's own, most striking when he took mere scraps of meat and milk and made feast enough for forty. The writers craft him thus - humble, seeking no proof of his calling, living quiet in truth and wonder. But this rings false, like thieves who'd steal Christ's crown to set it upon Muhammad's brow.\n\nThe book teems with tales meant to witness how men freely chose his way. But these stories come third-hand or worse, passed down like children's whispers - one heard from another who heard from another still. They aimed to prove truth but bred only doubt, like tracks in sand already half-blown away.\n\nWhat galls most is how they'd paint him gentle and meek, wise and pure of heart. But history tells different tales of blood and iron, and I wonder if his followers today know the true shape of their prophet's rise to power, or if they too are lost in these gentle lies.",
            "The words of the Christ and what he held true in his days were cast off like old rags, abandoned quick as they came. The truth of it stretches out before us like some barren highway leading nowhere, each mile marker showing how far we strayed from where we started. The world now bears witness to something different, something that moves like a slow tide washing away what came before. There are those who cling to the old ways like drowning men to driftwood but they grow fewer, their voices dimmer in the gathering dark.\n\nAmong the faithful there's a stirring. A knowing that spreads like fire through dry grass. They'll seek to peel away the layers of man's making, strip bare the bones of belief until nothing remains but what the carpenter from Nazareth brought forth into the world. It might take generations, might take centuries, but sure as winter follows autumn it will come. The great undoing. Like watching time flow backward through some broken clock, doctrine falling away piece by piece until only the raw truth remains, unadorned and pure as the day it was spoken.\n\nWhen this tide sweeps through the lands of the West like some great cleansing wind, the churches will still stand but they'll be different. Changed. Where once there were a thousand different paths there'll be one. Unity will rise from the ashes of division like some pale phoenix. We've seen such reversals before, seen how the world can turn itself inside out. Rome once fed Christians to lions and then knelt before the cross. Black men went from chains to power. The wheel turns and what was down comes up again.\n\nThis great undoing that's coming will need new eyes to read old words. Not taking every utterance as gospel carved in stone but seeing through to the truth beneath, like looking through clear water to the bottom of a stream.\n\nLong ago, before all this, there was only the faith of Abraham. One God, one truth, one holy book. But even then the cracks were showing. Jerusalem under Roman boots split five ways - the Sadducees in their fine robes, Pharisees with their laws, Essenes in the desert, Zealots with their knives, and the common folk caught between them all like leaves in a wind.",
            "The greed runs deep in men's hearts like some ancient poison coursing through their veins. He'd seen it in The Jungle. Seen how they'd turn on their own kind quick as wolves in winter. No care for them below. No thought for the weak ones. Just the wanting and the having and the getting more.\n\nThe factory men were the worst of them. Stood in their offices high above the killing floors watching the smoke pour forth from their chimneys like some hell-wrought offering to a darker god. Black smoke stretching out across the land far as eye could see, marking their domain like territorial beasts. Sinclair wrote of them chimneys standing stark against the sky, smoke rivers flowing endless to the world's edge. He knew what it meant. Knew the poison they was putting into the air and earth and water. Didn't matter none to the owners about the folk breathing it or the creatures dying in it.\n\nThe workers were less than nothing to them. Just meat for the machine. They'd work a man till his bones showed through his skin then cast him aside like spent cartridges. No loyalty in that place. No decency neither. Just dollars speaking their cold arithmetic. A man's worth measured in pennies and nickels, his life cheaper than the cattle they slaughtered.\n\nPackingtown they called it. Should have called it Hell's Waiting Room. No laws to protect the workers then. No safety neither. Just the endless grind of the machinery and the screaming of the dying beasts and sometimes you couldn't tell which was which. The people lived there like slaves in ancient times, foreign folk mostly, hanging on by threads thin as spider silk. Their masters were worse than any plantation owner, dealing in flesh both living and dead. And in such darkness what blooms but the blackest flowers of man's nature? The unions come but they was jackals too, feeding off the desperation. There was no escape from that place. No salvation. Just the grinding of the great machine eating up souls and spitting out profit.",
            "In the darkened realm where Poe's words take root there lies a poem called Dream-land. He wrote it and called it among his finest works though who can say what drives a man to such proclamations. Within its verses the word Thulé appears like some ancient signpost, twice marked, once at the beginning and again at the end, and scholars say it comes from Virgil who spoke of lands beyond the edge of knowing, north of Britain where the world falls away into darkness and ice.\n\nBut there was something else. Something closer. The German writers had gotten hold of Poe's mind and would not let go. Among them stood Goethe whose words burned across the century like signal fires. Arndt saw it plain enough in his studying. Said Poe had taken Goethe's measure and sought to match it stride for stride.\n\nThe Oxford books tell of Goethe and his Faust, that great work split in two parts like a cord of wood, the first piece laid down in 1808 and the second not till the year death took him in 1832. And there in the second part lies hidden a darker tale, The King of Thulé. It speaks of a king whose queen passes leaving nothing but a goblet and memories that drink won't wash away. When he can bear it no longer he gives away all he owns save that cup and walks to where the earth ends. Throws it to the sea. Closes his eyes. Dies.\n\nThere's something of Poe in that king. Something of the bottle and the grief that drives men to it. The darkness recognizing darkness across the years. Grattan saw it too and made it into theater in 1842, just before Poe took up the word Thulé again in The Pit and the Pendulum.\n\nThulé appears twice in all Poe's work like twin stars in a black sky. Once in Pit and Pendulum and twice more bracketing Dream-Land like dark sentinels. Read them together, these tales of Thulé, and you'll see the same desolate country. A world drained of color where dead friends walk and loneliness spreads like morning frost. It's as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's kingdom and found it matched the geography of his own heart.\n\nGoethe cast a long shadow in those days. Poe would have known him if only through Tennyson whom he admired with a fire that burned fierce and bright. But there were other paths too, other ways Goethe's words might have found him in those years after Faust first spoke its lines to the world.",
            "The law spoke of malice and despicable deeds but the truth was darker than any words writ upon paper by men in their towers of justice. The store manager sat in his office that evening eating his dinner while outside his door the fluorescent lights hummed their dead song over the aisles where the applesauce lay spilled like some pale blood upon the cold tile floor.\n\nFirst it was Wayne who came. Wayne with his hollow eyes and his green apron hanging loose like a condemned man's shroud. He spoke of the spill but the manager only stared at his food and said he had no time for such things. Then came Haddigan quarter hour later speaking the same words but they fell dead in that room like birds struck from winter sky.\n\nThe woman Palmer she came last. Not knowing. Not seeing. The floor stretched out before her like some treacherous river crossing and when she fell it was as if the earth itself had betrayed her. Her back broke not like a branch but like hope itself. In the year before five others had fallen in that same store their bodies betrayed by the same careless disregard that now claimed Palmer as its latest tribute.\n\nThe law spoke of obligations and compensatory damages but these were just words trying to put order to chaos. What mattered was the willful blindness. The conscious turning away. The manager knew what lurked in those aisles having seen five others fall before but still he sat and ate while danger waited patient as death for its next victim.\n\nIn the end it would be for the judge to decide if this negligence rose to the level of malice that the law demanded for punitive damages. If this disregard for human safety was despicable enough to warrant special punishment. The evidence lay before them like artifacts from some darker age - the timestamps of warnings ignored the history of falls that came before the simple fact of a man who chose his dinner over his duty to protect those who walked his aisles.\n\nThe law would have its say but the truth was already written in Palmer's broken body and in the cold calculations of a man who knew the risks but turned away all the same. There would be no summary dismissal here. The facts themselves stood witness dark and damning as cemetery stones.",
            "The wanting came to her like a thirst that wouldn't quit. Started when she was fourteen and held fast through the years that followed, clinging to her like old shadows in dying light. By seventeen it had shaped itself into something else. Not a thing but a someone. The boys came and went, awkward in their pursuit, fumbling at romance like blind men at locks. None took. She studied this peculiarity in herself like reading old maps, searching for landmarks that weren't there, finding only the blank spaces where answers ought to be. So she walked on through her days carrying this thing that had no name.\n\nThe house stood quiet most days. Her people were peaceful folk who moved through rooms like ghosts, their voices soft as ash falling. Arguments were rare as rain in drought lands, save when the girl's wild spirit rose up against their quietude. She carried something fierce and bright in her that stood at odds with their stillness, yet folk were drawn to her like moths to flame.\n\nThen came the day when peace broke. She was moving room to room, restless as wind, when her mother's cry split the air like lightning. Kitchen-ways. She ran, calling out, her heart a hammer in her chest. Found her mother laid out on the tile like something broken. Pain had hold of her and wouldn't let go. The girl knelt beside her, hands hovering uncertain. Mother's words came broken and scattered: hospital, hurry, help. The girl, strong from years of working iron, lifted her mother like a child. Carried her to the waiting car, laid her gentle in the back, and drove through streets empty as dead riverbeds.\n\nThe hospital rose up before them like some concrete monument to suffering. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic and fear, but the girl noticed none of it, her world narrowed to her mother's pain. She called out and white-coated figures appeared like pale wraiths, wheeling out a stretcher. They took her mother away down corridors bright and merciless as desert sun, leaving the girl alone with her worry.\n\nLater they told her: a step-stool, a high cabinet, a vase. Simple things that conspired to bring her mother low. She sat and waited in that place of sickness and healing, watching shadows lengthen across walls white as bone.",
            "They studied the old ways of eating. The Mediterranean way. Not like the others but something darker and more ancient. Something that spoke to the blood and the heart. In the beginning there were seventy four thousand eight hundred and eighty six women. Nurses all of them. They had no heart disease nor the sugar sickness that plagues mankind. The researchers watched them for twenty years like patient sentinels marking the passage of time and death itself.\n\nThe women wrote down what they ate. Six times over those long years they wrote it all down. What passed their lips and into their bodies. The fruits and the nuts and the grains ground to dust. Fish from the deep waters. The researchers made numbers of these things. Scores they called them. Like marking the passage of the dead but these marked the living.\n\nSome ate like the old ones did. The Mediterranean people. Others did not. The researchers watched and waited. Death came as it always does. Two thousand three hundred and ninety one hearts failed. One thousand seven hundred and sixty three minds were starved of blood till they died. The numbers told a story as old as time. Those who ate like the ancients lived longer. Their hearts were stronger. Their blood flowed true.\n\nThey measured everything. The weight of their bodies. The smoke in their lungs. The pills they took to thin their blood. Whether they bore children still or had ceased. Whether they moved their bodies under the sun or sat idle. All of it marked down in ledgers like a careful accounting of souls.\n\nIn the end the numbers spoke clear as bones in the desert. Those who followed the old ways, who ate the fruits of the earth and the fish of the sea, they lived. Their hearts beat longer. Their minds stayed clear. The others died sooner, their bodies betraying them like false prophets in the night. Such is the way of things. Such is the price we pay for forgetting the old wisdom that lives in our blood.",
            "The cardboard sign hung there in the gray light. Hitler is alive in Burma. The girl held it above her head like some proclamation of doom, standing alone on that corner where the wind swept ash and old newspapers across the blacktop. She'd been in pictures. Movies that no one would watch anymore.\n\nBurma. Myanmar. Names dont matter now. The junta rose up in 62 like some biblical plague visited upon the people. A darkness. Soldiers with their rifles and their tanks moving through streets where monks in saffron robes walked barefoot carrying nothing but their bowls. The first protests in ten years. Ten years of silence broken by gunfire and screaming and the sound of monastery doors being kicked in. They came for the foreign journalists too. Rounded them up like cattle. Shot them where they stood. A Japanese man named Nagai lay dead in the street on September 27th, his camera still clicking away at nothing as his lifeblood ran into the gutters.\n\nThirteen dead they said. Colonel Win knew better. He'd seen the bodies stacked like cordwood behind the barracks. Several thousand he said. Several thousand souls crying out in the void.\n\nThese things were nothing new. They'd happened before and they'd happen again. The Romans had done it. The Japanese. Now these generals with their medals and their decorated uniforms stained with the blood of their own people. Man has always killed man. Has always found reason to do so. Even now somewhere in the world someone was dying because someone else had decided they should.\n\nTiananmen Square stood as testament. The tanks rolling through the streets crushing the bones of students and workers alike. Two hundred dead said the government. Three thousand said the Red Cross. The truth lay somewhere in between or perhaps beyond both. In Rwanda they killed with machetes. Neighbor against neighbor. Hutu against Tutsi. The streets ran red. And before that there was Hitler. The camps. The chambers. The ovens burning day and night. The ash falling like gray snow. All of it written in the blood of millions. All of it carried in the wind like some dark promise. Some covenant with death that man had made long ago and could not break.\n\nThe girl stood there holding her sign. A witness to things she could not change. To horrors beyond counting. The wind took her hair and whipped it about her face like black smoke. Like a veil. Like something mourning all of mankind.",
            "The old maestro's mark on the music they called jazz came from the long years he spent wielding that orchestra like some dark instrument of God. His hands moved across them ivory keys quiet as a thief in the night but it was in the writing of the music that his true power lay dormant waiting to strike. He knew each man in that band like a father knows his sons and he wrote for their souls not just their horns. He'd craft these pieces like some old world artificer building frameworks of brass and wood and gut string where them soloists could roam free as wild horses on the plain. But he could reign them in too when he needed with notes precise as prison bars.\n\nThe sound. Always the sound. He shaped it like a sculptor shapes clay, knew just how to bend it and mold it till it fit right in the ear like it was always meant to be there. Weren't no accident neither. He studied them players like a hunter studies prey, learned the way each one moved and breathed and when he put them all together it was like watching some great machine come to life, all the gears and wheels turning just so.\n\nTake that piece they called Creole Love Call. Six parts to it like the chambers in a revolver and each one loaded different. First comes the voice pure as spring water then turning dark and rough like creek water after rain. Then a trumpet crying out through a mute like some wounded animal in the night. High clarinet floating over it all like a ghost while the piano keeps time below quiet as footsteps in sand. The whole band rises up then like a storm coming, brass and reeds calling back and forth across the darkness till finally that voice returns growling like some creature that aint quite human no more.\n\nHe wrote another one called Hot and Bothered where he took Miley's trumpet and Cox's voice and made them dance together like they was kin. Then there was It Don't Mean a Thing where old Tricky Sam's trombone spoke the first words like some preacher starting up a sermon. Each piece different but carrying that same dark blood in its veins. That was the old man's gift. He could make music speak in tongues that wasn't meant for speaking at all.",
            "He sat there studying the shells. Ancient things. Spiraled and calcified testimonies to lives long past. The question that gnawed at him was how these creatures came to be what they were, what forces shaped them in the darkness of deep time. Back in 1917 a man named Thompson had written that science hadn't yet found the mathematics to describe even the simplest living things. Truth was, they still hadn't.\n\nThe shell lay before him on the scarred wooden table. Prunum, they called it. He turned it in his fingers, watching how the light played across its surface. They'd taken X-rays of hundreds of these things, feeding numbers into machines that could birth ghost-shells, theoretical forms that might have been or might yet be. The computer program was called CerioShell, though names meant little now.\n\nHe thought about how a shell grows. Like a living geometry, a spiral road through time and space. Three hundred and sixty degrees of pure mathematics, though there was nothing pure about it. The whorls, that's what they called the turns, spinning around an invisible axis they named columella, though it was really just the spine of the thing. Each whorl separated by a line they called a suture, like stitches holding the whole thing together.\n\nThe biggest part, the body whorl, that's where the creature made its last stand before death took it. Above that, the spire rose like a tower of previous lives, previous moments, all the way to the apex. At the bottom, the base. And there in the opening, the aperture, that's where life once crept in and out, conducting its business with the world.\n\nYou could look at these things from any angle. From above, from below, from the front where the creature once emerged. He'd learned to count the whorls, drawing lines across the shell's face like measuring time itself, quarter turn by quarter turn, marking the slow accretion of calcium and purpose.\n\nHe thought about how each shell was really just a series of doorways, each aperture a frozen moment in the creature's journey through time. You could trace it, map it, try to capture it in numbers and equations. But in the end, it was all just guesswork at God's geometry, trying to understand why things grew the way they did, why life chose the paths it chose.\n\nThe mathematics of it all lay there like a dead language, waiting to be resurrected. But even then, even if you could speak it perfectly, you'd still just be describing shadows on a cave wall, not the thing itself. Not the force that drove it all.",
            "They stood there in the dim light of the government office studying the numbers on the wall. Charts and figures that told of dead children. Ten years worth of them laid out in cold statistics that hadnt changed. Numbers that spoke of mothers too. The boy looked up at him. What does it mean papa.\n\nIt means they're dying son. Same as they always did.\n\nIn the cities and in the villages they died. The lucky ones had someone there. Someone who knew the old ways of bringing life into the world. But knowledge aint always enough. When the blood comes. When things go wrong. They called them midwives but they might as well have been ghosts for all the good they could do when death came calling.\n\nHe remembered the hospital in Jakarta. Clean white walls and machines that beeped in the night. Seven of every hundred mothers got their babies cut from them there. In the villages it was two. Numbers that told a story of who lived and who died based on nothing more than where they drew their first breath.\n\nThe poor died more. Always had. Twenty-seven percent more of them never saw inside a hospital than the rich. Money was the difference between life and death and it always had been. Some things dont change even when the world tries to make them change.\n\nThey talked about programs. About targeting specific problems like a hunter sighting down a rifle barrel. Quick fixes and immediate results that looked good on paper. But he knew better. Had seen what happened when you built one thing up while letting everything else crumble. Like trying to prop up one wall of a burning house. The whole thing would come down eventually. Always did.\n\nHe looked at the boy again. The boy was studying the charts with those solemn eyes of his. Papa, he said. Why dont they fix all of it.\n\nBecause son. Sometimes the simplest answer is the hardest one to see.",
            "The music they called Popular had growed and spread like some dark vine across a hundred years til a man couldnt name all its branches anymore. Each limb of it birthing new ones. Rap and rock and country and jazz and folk and others nameless and strange. Like some ancient tree whose roots ran deep into the black soil of time. And from these roots come Heavy Metal, forty years past, spreading like wildfire through the musical wasteland. A thing built of darkness and rage but containing multitudes. Raw emotions stripped bare and bleeding. Men saw its power and took to shaping it like hot iron, hammering out new forms til the original shape was lost to memory.\n\nNow the metal stands transformed, a thousand faces staring back from the dark. A thing that feeds on other music like some desperate creature, taking what it needs, leaving the rest to rot. To know its true nature you got to go back. Back to where it began. Back to understand why they call it a movement and not just music.\n\nMetal dwells in darkness like some cave-thing. Always wanting more. More thunder in the bass, more violence in the sound, more theater in the spectacle. These weren't no primitive players neither. These were men who knew their tools like a hunter knows his knife. And there was the drugs too, coursing through it all like poison in the blood. Mid-seventies when the psychedelics hit hard and the music turned strange and otherworldly, like something born in fever dreams. It carried things in it that other music wouldn't touch. Dark things. Visceral things. Things that reached back to them old Romantic composers who knew about darkness too. The kind of darkness that makes a man write words like these here below, though the paper they was writ on is long since ashes.\n\nThem Beatles, they wrote Helter Skelter trying to outdo the Stones. Show em they could walk in darkness too. Some say it was the first real Metal song, though such things aint easy to reckon. A song about going up and down, about losing your mind to them pills and powders. They put it on that white album like a black mark on a clean sheet.",
            "In the time before the dreamers came with their wild paintings there was another who walked alone. Rousseau was his name and he crafted visions that came to him in the deep of night, both real and imagined. The Dream they called it, this thing he made in 1910, and in it lay not just some woman lost in wonderment at the strange country round her but Rousseau's own yearnings that gnawed at him like hunger. Recognition he sought. Acceptance too. These things burned in him while he walked the path between what others wanted and what his hands knew to do.\n\nHe was born in a place called Laval where the wind comes hard off the northwest coast of France. His father worked metal and sold hardware and they didnt starve. No teachers showed him the way of art. He worked for the government collecting tolls till he was forty years gone from his birth, though some called him customs man which he wasnt. His first wife Clémence died after watching eight babies go into the ground. Only Julia lived. The grief sat in him like stone and he took up the brush hoping it might wash clean what was stained.\n\nHe painted different from the others who made pretty pictures of country folk. He painted true because he was of them. Common blood. Common dreams.\n\nThe art world was a beast he could not tame. Started late with no learning and worked alongside men who'd mastered the craft in their youth. Matisse was rising then, but they were different sorts entirely. Matisse feared the common way of painting like it was death itself while Rousseau wanted nothing more than to make something so right and proper that the Artiste Français would open their doors to him. But doors dont open easy to men who walk alone.",
            "He sat there thinking on them things that men before him had thought on. Ethics and beauty and how they was bound together like flesh to bone. Old Keats had wrote it down plain as day on that grecian urn of his. Beauty is truth and truth beauty and that was all there was to know in this world. Most everything a man learns comes by way of books or hard living but these things was different. Like they was already there waiting to be found.\n\nHe thought on how describing beauty or goodness was like trying to catch smoke in your hands. You could talk about the Mona Lisa's shadows or the way the background stretched away behind her like something from a fever dream but that wasnt it. That wasnt what made it beautiful. Folk would always say there was just something about it before they started in with their fancy talk. Like they knew the words wasnt enough.\n\nHe remembered what that woman O'Connor had said about stories. How they was meant to say things that couldn't be said no other way. Like they was carrying something bigger than words. Something that lived in the spaces between em. And he reckoned it was the same with right and wrong. That writer Wittgenstein knew it too. Said ethics couldn't be spoke of proper cause they was beyond speaking.\n\nThe connection twixt the two of them, art and morals, it lived in that place you couldn't quite reach. Like trying to remember a dream that slips away soon as you wake. The deeper truth of it all existed somewhere past what a man could put into words. Literature carried it strongest of all the arts cause it dealt in the currency of life itself. Values and choices and the hard paths men walk. The things that make us human in this godless world.\n\nHe watched the sun sink below the horizon, painting the sky in colors that no artist could capture. Thought about how some truths cant be spoke, only felt in the marrow of your bones. How beauty and goodness was like that. Beyond telling. Beyond knowing. Just there, waiting to be found by them that had eyes to see.",
            "The land lay ancient and cold beneath the alpine shadows stretching north like some great beast's spine from München to the dark waters of the Baltic where Kiel stood sentinel against the gray horizon. The old ways persisted here like blood in the earth, seeping through the stones of Köln where the Rhine carved its path and eastward through Saxon country where Dresden brooded by the Elbe's sluggish waters. This was Germania.\n\nThey called it different names in the old tongue. Some said it came from the Tungrians, fierce warriors who crossed the Rhine in times before memory, when the world was younger and the gods walked closer to men. Caesar knew them. Wrote of them in his accounts of blood and conquest, marking them separate from the Gauls he'd broken beneath Rome's heel. The Germans remained untamed, wild things that lurked beyond the river's far bank, emerging in the night with spears they called ger, their war-cries splitting the darkness like thunder.\n\nTacitus wrote of them too, scratching his observations onto parchment while Rome's streets baked under Mediterranean sun. He saw them as creatures of the soil, born from the earth itself, unmixed with foreign blood. Who would choose such a place, he wondered. Who would abandon warm southern climes for this raw country with its sullen skies and forests that whispered old secrets in tongues no Roman could comprehend.\n\nThe Romans came nonetheless, drawn by amber and fur and things that glittered in the ground. They built their roads and fortresses but never stayed, always returning to their marble columns and heated baths, leaving Germania to its shadows. The tribes remained, trading their forest-wealth for Roman coin, sending their young men to march beneath imperial eagles while their true gods waited patient in the deep woods, knowing Rome's time would pass like all things must, while Germania endured, eternal as the stones.",
            "The play stretches out before us like some ancient tapestry gone yellow with age, threads bare in places where time has gnawed at the fabric. Deception lies at its heart, a dark and necessary thing, like a knife kept ready against the wolves. But there is a cost to wearing masks and the soul knows this cost even if the mind does not. The self becomes a stranger in its own skin and must one day choose between preservation and the bonds that tie it to others. Some will forgive the lie. Others will carry it like a wound that never heals.\n\nWhen the mask is one of gender it cuts deeper still. The question hangs in the air like smoke - why would one abandon the shelter of their own flesh? For Viola it was survival pure and simple. The words fall from her lips like stones: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" She speaks of preservation but what is preserved is merely the body while the spirit wanders lost in the wilderness of pretense.\n\nThe deception works its dark magic but leaves her cut off from her own kind, adrift in a world of women who cannot know her. And Olivia, poor Olivia, sees in her the ghost of Sebastian and loves what is not there: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" The words echo hollow in the empty air. Even Orsino carries the weight of unspoken desire: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"\n\nTo modern eyes the play might seem to speak of hidden hungers, of desires that dare not speak their names. Olivia and Orsino move through their scenes like sleepwalkers, their true hearts masked even from themselves. But perhaps Shakespeare saw deeper still, saw how Olivia's quick transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian marked her as one who loved with her eyes alone, as if the heart could be fooled by mere appearance. At the last she names Viola sister - \"A sister, you are she\" - and in those words lies both acceptance and forgiveness, as if the truth, once spoken, could wash clean all that came before.",
            "They called it German rule but there was nothing German about the blood. Blood speaks its own tongue and the Herero and Nama knew it well when the Germans came with their rifles and their orders and their need to plant flags in foreign soil. The land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nIn the east they built schools. Built them like they meant something. Like knowledge could bridge what guns had sundered. The British found them there when they came. Found the africans who could read and write and cipher numbers. Found them in Tanganyika and in Kamerun too. But in the southwest there was nothing. Nothing but missionaries wandering like pilgrims through the wasteland spreading their word to empty air while the government watched and did nothing.\n\nThe whites got their schools though. Got them built proper with government coin. Got their children taught proper too while the natives watched from beyond the windows, their faces pressed against glass that showed them nothing but their own reflection. Most never learned to read. Most never learned to write. Most just learned to survive.\n\nThe southwest was different. Different in ways that spoke of deeper things. Of older things. Things that lived in the hearts of men who came to plant their flags and spread their seed. By 1913 they numbered fifteen thousand strong. White faces in a brown land. More than anywhere else in all their conquered realm. The climate suited them they said. Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right for making something of their own. Something that would last.\n\nBut the land remembered. The land always remembers.\n\nThey wrote about it later. Wrote about it in German first then English. Wrote about how different it was from place to place. Territory to territory. How the schools worked here but not there. How the teaching took root in some soil but not in others. They had their reasons. Their explanations. Their theories written in neat lines on clean paper. But paper burns and ink fades and in the end there is only the land and what it remembers.",
            "They stood at the border, these two nations, like ancient beasts eyeing each other across a divide that stretched fifty-seven years deep into time. From 1836 to 1893 they circled and prowled, the United States and Mexico, their rivalry carved into the very bones of the earth. The war came in 1846 like some dark tide rising, Americans moving south with their rifles and their god, taking Texas and the Southwest territories in blood and dust and gunsmoke.\n\nThe border between them was a thing alive, a serpentine line drawn in sand and stone where cultures ground against each other like tectonic plates. Religion stood between them like a wall. Protestant and Catholic, each carrying the ghosts of old world hatreds in their veins, the English and Spanish dead whispering ancient grievances into living ears.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed in those years, most often over the borderlands where outlaws and brigands moved like wraiths through the desert night. Raiders crossed back and forth, leaving destruction in their wake until both nations sent their armies to stand watch in the wastes. The border towns existed in a kind of twilight, neither here nor there, where a man might wake to find himself in one country or another depending on which way the wind had blown the sand that night.\n\nThe rivalry was a living thing until it wasn't. Like some great beast lying down to die, it faded as Mexico grew dependent on its northern neighbor. The United States no longer looked to the land with hungry eyes but turned its gaze to money and markets. The old hatreds didn't die but transformed, became something else, something that could be counted in ledgers instead of bodies.\n\nThey share that border still, these two nations, though the nature of their dance has changed. The ghosts of old conflicts walk those lands yet, their footprints hidden beneath the shifting sands of time, waiting for those who know where to look. In the end it was not god or guns that bridged the divide but the cold arithmetic of commerce, turning blood-soaked earth into columns of numbers, transforming ancient enmity into profit and loss.",
            "Fifteen years back the sickness came. Not gradual like most afflictions but sudden and complete, like a door slamming shut in the dark. I didn't even know such a thing existed until it had me in its grip.\n\nI was a nurse then. Chose it out of some deep hollow need for safety that came from having none as a child. They'd all say it - you'll always find work, folk'll always be sick and dying. So I buried my dreams of science and words and took up with the healing trade though it wasn't what my heart wanted.\n\nThen there I was. Forty-six years lived and alone, nothing saved, and the work gone from me like smoke. Still am broken, these fifteen years later. Living on government handouts has stripped me bare. Everything I once called mine is gone now. Each day's a battle against the void, against the feeling of being less than whole. Nothing's certain anymore except one truth that burns like a coal in the dark - I wouldn't have survived without my people. Family. The few friends who stayed. When the real darkness comes you learn quick how weak you really are.\n\nThat's the thing about catastrophe. It comes without warning. No matter how you shore up against it, some storms are too big to weather alone. Like them old pioneers crossing the mountains. Conservatives preach about going it alone but that ain't how the wagons made it west. It was sharing. Looking out. Helping hands in the night.\n\nSo yes, lay in your stores. I got mine - medical supplies, water tablets, tape for the windows against whatever poison might come on the wind. Flashlights. Batteries. Candles and matches sealed against damp. Canned goods lined up like soldiers. Plant your garden if you got the land. Stack your wood if you got a stove to burn it.\n\nBut while you're preparing for the end of things, know your neighbors. Because when the real darkness comes, it ain't rugged independence that'll save us. It's the light we keep burning for each other.",
            "In the old world, before the steel and concrete rose up to mock the heavens, there lived a prince. They would later call him Buddha though that wasnt his name then. None knew what would come. He cast off the gilded chains of his station like a snake shedding its skin and walked into the wastes of the world until enlightenment found him or he found it, who could say. What he taught became Buddhism and the Theravada sect claimed to hold closest to his words, though who could know after twenty five hundred years of men's tongues wagging and their minds forgetting.\n\nIn Sri Lanka they cut the water now. Some ceremony the Buddha never spoke of. Monks in their saffron robes and the common folk too, gathering like pilgrims at some ancient well. The faith had changed like everything changes, wearing smooth like river stones beneath the endless flow of time. The guardians of the old ways, both robed and common, had bent like reeds in the wind, doctrine twisting and reshaping itself against forces from within and without. Some came with fire and sword, others with mere indifference, each leaving their mark like the tide leaves its mark upon the shore.\n\nThey spoke of internal forces and external ones as if such things could be parsed clean like butchered meat. Internal meant those who claimed the Buddha's way as their own, external meant all others though such divisions meant little in the end. Then there were those who came meaning harm and those who meant nothing at all, though harm or help might follow in their wake like carrion birds following a war party.\n\nAt the heart of it lay the triple gem they sought refuge in: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. The Dhamma held in three baskets of ancient words: the Suttas with their teachings, the Vinaya with its rules, the Abhidhamma with its truths about the nature of things. They spoke of Anatta - the absence of soul, Dukkha - the suffering that clings to life like smoke to clothing, Anicca - how nothing lasts, nothing stays, everything crumbles to dust in time. Only by seeing these truths could one break free from Sansara, that wheel of death and rebirth grinding on and on like some cosmic mill wheel. Then would end the holy trinity of man's afflictions: desire, hatred, delusion. The rules came after, five for common folk - no killing, no lying, no stealing, no rutting like beasts, no drowning sense in drink or smoke. More rules for the monks, though rules were just words and words were wind.\n\nFour noble truths stood at the center like stone pillars in a temple: that life was suffering, that wanting caused the suffering, that suffering could end. These were the bones everything else was built upon."
