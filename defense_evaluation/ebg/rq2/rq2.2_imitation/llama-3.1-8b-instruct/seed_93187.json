            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of a world beset on all sides by the ravages of human suffering, I find myself drawn to the path of social work. A career within the Division of Family and Children Services beckons, a siren's call to those who would seek to heal the wounds of the broken and the battered. It is a calling that speaks to the deepest recesses of my being, a summons to take up the mantle of compassion and to wield it against the cruel indifference of a world that often seems more concerned with the smooth operation of its own machinery than the well-being of its most vulnerable members. \n\nThe values that guide me on this journey are not those of a stranger, but of a pilgrim who has walked the hard roads of this world and has seen the ravages of its cruelty. Service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships between individuals - these are the bedrock upon which I stand. And I am driven by a fierce determination to hone my craft, to sharpen my skills and to remain steadfast in the face of the unrelenting tide of human suffering.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of others, and it was only a matter of time before I found myself on this path. The years spent in high school and college were a crucible, a testing ground where I saw the fractures in the social fabric of our society laid bare. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their faces a mask of denial, while others searched for solace in fleeting escapes. It was then that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a caregiver and to wield it against the forces of despair.\n\nMy journey to this point has not been an easy one. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I felt adrift, unsure of the path that lay ahead. But it was on that summer, in the sterile quiet of a friend's living room, that I encountered a young boy, his eyes a window to a soul battered and bruised by the cruel hand of circumstance. His story is one that has stayed with me to this day, a burning ember of conscience that fuels my determination to act. I drove to his parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding, and there I found myself face to face with the abyss of human cruelty. The parents, their faces a mask of feigned concern, their words a tissue of lies and half-truths, tried to shift the blame onto their son, to portray him as a manipulative child who had brought this suffering upon himself. But I saw the truth, a truth that has stayed with me to this day: that the true monsters are not the children, but the adults who fail to protect and nurture them.\n\nAnd so I began to walk the path of social work, driven by a fierce determination to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Another value that guides me is social justice, a concept that is often trotted out as a catchphrase, but which I believe in with every fiber of my being. I have always been an outsider, a rebel who refuses to conform to the norms of a society that values sameness over individuality. I have fought against the tide of oppression, whether it was the stifling conformity of high school or the entrenched racism and homophobia of our society. I have worn my hair in unnatural colors, pierced my ears, and declared my solidarity with those who are different from me. And I will continue to do so, for I believe that it is only by challenging the status quo that we can create a more just and equitable world.",
            "The darkness of insomnia, a shroud that wraps itself around the waking mind, has long been a subject of study. The twin prongs of the biological and sociocultural models offer two disparate yet intertwined perspectives on this affliction. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving calculus, reduces the complexity of sleep to the binary terms of genetic predisposition and physiological imperfection. The hypothalamus, a glandular outpost in the depths of the brain, governs the delicate balance between wakefulness and slumber, its neurons a symphony of firings and silences. The orexin neurons, those errant violinists, dance with the GABAB receptors, their harmonies a lullaby of sleep, or a cacophony of wakefulness. The study of mice, a proxy for humanity, reveals a truth both banal and profound: the activation of the GABAB receptor induces a sleep that is both a respite and a surrender. The inhibition of this receptor, a quietus, brings a stillness that is both restorative and oppressive. The GABAB agonist, a pharmacological siren, lures the sleeper into a realm of repose, a realm from which the waking world is distant and indistinct.\n\nBut the sociocultural model, a lens that refracts the prism of experience, reveals a more nuanced truth. The inheritance of the phenotypic GABAB receptor, a genetic legacy, shapes the contours of our sleep, a topography of the self. The alterations to this receptor, a subtle yet decisive tweak, can unravel the fabric of our waking lives, leaving in its wake a trail of fragmented thoughts and behaviors. The implications are stark: a life lived in the shadow of insomnia, a life of fragmented days and sleepless nights, a life of halting steps and uncertain purpose.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, the insomnia-ridden mind wanders, lost and forlorn, a pilgrim without a map. The biological and sociocultural models, two competing cartographers, chart the terrain of this affliction, their maps a testament to the complexities of the human condition. But the truth, like the night itself, remains elusive, a will-o-the-wisp that beckons and escapes.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a quiet affliction, a disorder of the auditory realm that defies the senses and eludes the understanding. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition shrouded in the shadows of perception, lies at the heart of the enigma. It is a malady wherein the central nervous system, that labyrinthine network of neurons and synapses, falters in its duty to transcribe the whispers of the world into meaningful sound. The afflicted, though their ears may be intact, find themselves lost in a cacophony of confusion, their brains struggling to untangle the skein of noise that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder's existence date back to the 1950s, when the winds of research began to stir in the realm of communicative disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like beacons in the darkness, lit the path forward with their tests and trials, seeking to grasp the elusive nature of this condition. The work of Kimura, who introduced the concept of dichotic testing in 1961, illuminated the pathways of the auditory cortex, shedding light upon the mysteries of perception. And yet, despite these advances, the disorder remained shrouded, its true face hidden behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that dance upon a wall. The sufferer may find themselves lost in the expanse of sound, unable to pinpoint the source of a noise, or to distinguish between two or more competing auditory events. They may struggle to recognize patterns, to decipher the hidden rhythms that govern the world. The subtleties of speech, the nuances of tone and inflection, may be lost upon them, leaving them bereft of understanding. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, a cacophony of chaos that threatens to consume all. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves unable to synthesize the disparate threads of sound into a meaningful whole, or to unravel the sequence of auditory clues that govern the world.\n\nThe diagnosis of this disorder is a labyrinthine process, a journey through the twisting corridors of perception. The patient is subjected to a battery of tests, a series of trials designed to probe the depths of their auditory faculties. The audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists, like guides in a wilderness, navigate the patient through a maze of questionnaires and surveys, observation and experimentation. But even as they strive to grasp the essence of the disorder, they are confronted with the truth that there is no single, definitive test, no one tool that can unlock the secrets of the afflicted brain. The causes of the disorder remain a mystery, a whispered rumor in the darkness.",
            "In the depths of twelfth night's hush, where moonlight weaves an inconstant veil, Twelfth Night's whispered truths unfold like a tattered tapestry. A deceiver's guile, it seems, is a double-edged sword, capable of piercing the heart with a thousand cuts of sorrow. The outward guise, though a temporary reprieve, can soon become a shroud that suffocates the soul. To shed the disguise, to reveal the truth, is to risk being forsaken by those who once called you kin. And so, the choice is laid bare: to preserve the self, or to preserve the relationships that bind us to the fragile, faltering world.\n\nIn the realm of Twelfth Night, the dance of deception is a waltz of twisted desires, where the lines between truth and falsehood blur like the shifting sands of a desert dune. Viola, a maiden lost in a strange land, dons the cloak of masculinity to shield herself from the ravages of a hostile world. Her ruse, a clever contrivance, proves effective in its purpose, yet it exacts a terrible price: she is estranged from the very women who would have been her succor, her support in a world gone mad. The sea of Olivia's affections, once set upon the shore of Cesario's masculine form, now shifts to the rocky shores of Sebastian's fraternal presence. The tides of desire, it seems, are as changeable as the wind.\n\nAnd yet, in this maelstrom of deception, a glimmer of insight emerges. The masks we wear, the guises we assume, may be the catalyst for the unveiling of secrets long suppressed, hidden deep within the recesses of the heart. Olivia's ardor for Cesario, a flame that burns bright and fierce, may be but a reflection of a deeper longing, a yearning that dare not speak its name. Or is it a jest, a cruel mockery of the societal norms that bind us to the strictures of expectation? The ambiguity lingers, a shadow cast upon the page, a testament to the complexities of the human heart.\n\nIn Twelfth Night, Shakespeare weaves a tapestry of paradox and intrigue, a dance of deception that leads us down a path of discovery, where the masks we wear are but a fragile barrier between the self and the unknown.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of German colonial rule, a bleak tapestry of brutality was woven, most starkly evident in the genocide that ravaged the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, to speak of such atrocities as the sum total of an empire's cruelty would be a gross oversimplification. The German colonial project, a hydra-headed beast, exhibited a maddening diversity in its policies and ruling style, a labyrinthine complexity that defied reduction to a single description. Educational provision, a paltry lifeline cast to the colonized, was similarly variegated, a patchwork quilt of disparate threads that mirrored the fractured geography of the colonies.\n\nWhen the British assumed dominion over German East Africa, a land that would come to be known as Tanganyika, they found a population of Africans beset by the light of knowledge, their minds awakened to the whispers of literacy. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors had earned the praise of contemporary chroniclers. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark contrast emerged, a harsh dichotomy that would leave an indelible mark on the land. Unlike the East African colonies, where the government had taken a firm hand in the education of the native populations, in South West Africa, the task of enlightening the untutored masses was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the stingy support of a government more concerned with the education of its own kind. State schools for Europeans sprouted like weeds, their foundations laid upon the fertile soil of colonial largesse, while the native populations were left to wither, unlettered and unenlightened.\n\nThe legacy of these educational policies lingered, a ghostly presence that haunted the land long after the German colonial project had been extinguished. In South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the cruel hand of colonial fortune. The reasons for this divergence were multifaceted, a Gordian knot of social, political, and economic factors that had ensnared the colony in its grasp. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled threads of this narrative, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the new research that has shed light upon this oft-overlooked chapter in the annals of colonial history.\n\nA vast literature has grown up around the topic of education in the German colonial empire, a sprawling jungle of sources that threaten to overwhelm the unwary scholar. The earliest works, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with describing the contours of educational systems in the various colonies. Later writings, penned in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, undertaking comparative studies of education in the German colonies and subjecting the specific aspects of education to close analysis. These studies revealed a tapestry of differences, a rich and varied brocade that defied reduction to a single narrative. Cohen's magnum opus, a study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a towering monolith in this literature, its influence still felt today. Cohen's research, a probing examination of the educational systems of the two colonies, shed light upon the factors that accounted for their divergent paths.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, presented a colonial authority with a choice: to cultivate the arid desert that stretched across the territory, to coax forth the hidden riches that lay beneath the surface, or to succumb to the harsh beauty of the landscape. The European population, a hardy and resilient people, chose the latter path, drawn by the lure of a relatively temperate climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that swelled the ranks of the settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony, by nearly threefold. The stage was set for a drama of colonial proportions, one that would play out in the deserts and savannas of South West Africa, a drama that would be written in the blood of the native populations and the steel of the colonial project.",
            "In the crepuscular expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, labyrinthine forest, its classifications as elusive as the whispers of the wind. Genres have sprouted like weeds, their tendrils snaking into the earth, giving birth to a proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that defy mortal comprehension. Amidst this tangled thicket, Heavy Metal stands as a behemoth, its dark, Gothic limbs stretching towards the sky like a twisted, cadaverous tree. It is a genre of unbridled expression, a canvas of sound that paints the shadows on the wall of the human experience.\n\nIn the past four decades, the Metal movement has unfurled its dark, sinuous tendrils, embracing a kaleidoscope of emotions, yet fixated on the bleaker reaches of the emotional spectrum. Its offspring, a multitude of sub-genres, have burst forth like a riotous bloom, each one a unique, dark flower. The Metal movement, a churning, amorphous mass, has devoured and assimilated influences from other genres, yet its essence remains a mystery, a maelstrom of sound that defies categorization.\n\nTo grasp the Metal music that surrounds us, one must first confront the void that lies at its core. Metal is a music of excess, a defiant rejection of the bland, the mundane. It is a sound that conjures forth the primordial fears and desires that slumber beneath the surface of human consciousness. The virtuosos of Metal, masters of their craft, wield their instruments like serrated blades, slicing through the veil of reality to reveal the abyss that lies within.\n\nThe darkness that permeates Metal is not merely a metaphor; it is a lived experience, a vortex of emotions that draws the listener in, like a moth to the flame. The psychedelic excesses of the 1970s, a maelstrom of experimentation and creativity, birthed a generation of musicians who plumbed the depths of the human psyche, creating music that was at once beautiful and terrifying. The Romantic Era, with its emphasis on the sublime and the grotesque, left an indelible mark on the Metal movement, its influence still felt today.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that some claim to be one of the first Heavy Metal anthems, distill the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the darker side of rock, it is a declaration of sonic rebellion, a defiant cry into the void. The Beatles, those masters of melodic craft, had created a sound that was at once innovative and unsettling, a sound that would influence generations to come.",
            "The Dream, a painting born of Henri Rousseau's ardent longing, lay in the crucible of his own tortured soul. Conceived in 1910, it was a moment of fleeting insight, a flash of lucidity amidst the unyielding din of his own creative torment. In this work, the artist, a man beset by the abyss of self-doubt, laid bare his own inner struggle - a Sisyphean quest for acceptance, for validation in a world that seemed determined to silence him.\n\nIt was a struggle born of circumstance, of the jagged topography of his own life. A tinsmith's son, raised in the provinces of northwest France, Rousseau's early years were marked by the dull, unyielding routine of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a man of little renown. The name he chose for himself, the douanier, a customs inspector, was a cruel mockery, a mocking reminder of his own pedestrian existence. His first wife, Clémence, died, taking with her eight infant children, leaving Rousseau to navigate the desolate landscape of grief, his only solace the fragile thread of a daughter, Julia.\n\nIt was in this desolate expanse that he found his solace in painting, a refuge from the crushing weight of his own insignificance. And yet, even as he poured his heart and soul into his work, he was driven by a hunger for recognition, for the approbation of the art world he so desperately sought to join. The Surrealists, those mad visionaries, were painting their own dreamscapes, their own private kingdoms of the mind, but Rousseau's Dream was something different, a desperate bid for acceptance, a plea for entry into a world that seemed determined to exclude him.\n\nFor years, he toiled in obscurity, his work unknown to the world beyond his humble circle. It was only when Matisse, that great master of modern art, began to make his mark, that Rousseau's own work began to gain recognition. And yet, even in his success, Rousseau remained haunted by the specter of his own inadequacy, a man forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own self-doubt. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's desire was not to create something new, something bold, but rather to paint a picture so conventional, so acceptably bourgeois, that he might finally be admitted to the rarefied ranks of the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream, that enigmatic painting, is a testament to this struggle, a cri de coeur from the depths of Rousseau's own tortured psyche. It is a painting of a woman, lost in a world of wonder, but also a painting of the artist himself, lost in a world of his own making, forever torn between the twin abysses of conformity and creative freedom.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a faint tremor runs through the fabric of thought. It is the whispered conversation between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. A murmur that echoes through the corridors of the mind, a siren's call to the unseen. For in the words of John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a bald assertion, a cry from the wilderness, a statement that defies the sterile light of reason.\n\nWe think we grasp ethics and aesthetics through the dusty tomes of learning or the worn pathways of experience. But no, they are not so easily captured. They are the will-o'-the-wisps that dance at the edge of perception, always receding into the shadows as we approach. As Keats so eloquently put it, both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe, not to prescribe. We seek to explain the why of a work of art, the why of a moral act, but the words falter on our lips like autumn leaves.\n\nCriticism, that most vaunted of endeavors, can never fully grasp the essence of what is good or beautiful. The critics' words, like the scratchings on a cave wall, are feeble attempts to corral the uncontainable. Consider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile that has beguiled the ages. Do we speak of her fame in terms of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context? No, we do not. We speak of something more, something that defies articulation. A phrase like \"There's just something about it\" trembles on the lips, a confession of the inadequacy of language.\n\nAnd so it is with ethics. Flannery O'Connor's words, like a desert wind, blow through our understanding: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics, like art, transcends the bounds of description. It speaks to something deeper, something that cannot be captured by the words of the wise or the learned. As Wittgenstein so starkly put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence, this je ne sais quoi, that binds ethics and aesthetics together in a bond of shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is both intimate and ineffable. It is a noumenal realm, a world beyond the reach of words. As Kant so astutely observed, it is a realm that is felt, not thought. And it is here, in this hidden place, that we find the connection between ethics and aesthetics. For it is in the art of literature that we find this connection most clearly. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" It is a quality that speaks to the very heart of our humanity, a quality that is both beautiful and true.",
            "The shadows of the Alps cast a somber hue upon the Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of disparate cultures. From the mist-shrouded spires of München to the Baltic's unforgiving shores in Kiel, a singular unity holds sway, a testament to the indomitable will of a people born of the land. The Rhine's dark waters course through the heart of Köln, a city veiled in mystery, while Dresden, a Saxon stronghold, stands sentinel on the Elbe, its stone façades bearing the weight of a storied past. It is little wonder, then, that the culture of this land is a tapestry rich with the threads of countless influences, a testament to the primordial forces that shaped the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name Germania are shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty, a labyrinth of conflicting theories and half-truths. Tacitus, that knowing chronicler of the Empire's darkest hours, posited that the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that had crossed the Rhine, their hearts afire with a warrior's passion. Others claimed that Julius Caesar, that master of the Gallic Wars, coined the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls' own tongue, a distinction between the subjugated and the unconquered. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a chilling testament to the unyielding ferocity of the Germanic tribes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe Old English Dictionary whispers another tale, one of a spear, a ger, wielded by warriors in the heat of battle, while the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" suggests a people unafraid to make their presence known. And yet, it is Tacitus who provides the most trenchant insight into the Germanic soul, his De Origine et situ Germanorum a searing indictment of the unforgiving landscape: \"I should regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans, those masters of conquest, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of disdain and fascination, their legions probing the borders of this unforgiving land, their spoils a testament to the Germanic tribes' unyielding ferocity. And so, the Germanic tribes, a motley assemblage of warriors and traders, lived on the fringes of the Empire, their skills honed in the crucible of battle, their goods exchanged for the fleeting promise of Roman wealth.

            "The vista before me lay shrouded in a dull haze.  My mind, a vacant slate, refused to inscribe meaning upon the scene that unfolded before my eyes.  The image, a jumble of disparate parts, held an illusory coherence, its constituent elements existing in a state of suspended animation, bereft of significance.  Thoughts arose, flitted, and then vanished, their ephemeral nature as fleeting as the wisp of smoke on the wind.\n\nIt was in a moment of fleeting curiosity that I had chanced upon \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist I had worked with had recommended it, and I, driven by a long-held aspiration to grasp the mysteries of line and form, had purchased the book.  The words within its pages spoke of a world where the pencil was not merely a tool, but a key to unlock the hidden harmonies of the universe.  One technique, a simple yet profound concept, had struck a chord within me: the imposition of a frame upon the chaos of the world, a square boundary that reduced the multiplicity of experience to a unified whole.\n\nAnd yet, as I stood before the offending bundle, my mind recoiled in the face of such simplicity.  The mess before me defied the neat compartmentalization of art.  It was a thing, a thing that had once lived, a thing that now lay broken and discarded, a thing that mocked my attempts to impose order upon it.  I thought of the masters: Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's kaleidoscope of color.  And I, a lowly aspirant, stood before this, this thing, and felt the weight of my own insignificance.\n\nMy hand, a clumsy instrument, hovered over the handle of the toilet.  The muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed once more, as if driven by a will beyond my own.  The handle, a stubborn obstacle, refused to yield to my touch.  I stood, a figure of futility, as the seconds ticked by like grains of sand in an empty hourglass.  My grip on the mop relaxed, my feet shifted, and I stared, a man transfixed, at the thing that lay before me.\n\nA few more moments passed, each one a tiny, insignificant droplet in the vast ocean of time.  And then, my hand, a puppet on a string, moved towards the wall, grasped the sheet of toilet paper, and began to wrap itself in a chilling shroud.  I stood, a figure of desolation, and dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a gesture both intimate and grotesque.",
            "In the desolate landscape of America's roads, a terrible toll is exacted upon the young.  Teenagers succumb to the unforgiving wheel, their lives extinguished by the very thing meant to set them free.  The National Institutes of Health have shed light on the calamitous forces at play, revealing that the adolescent brain is woefully unprepared to confront the perils of the highway.  Inexperience, that most insidious of demons, stalks the roads, claiming its victims with ruthless efficiency.  It is a specter that haunts not only the statistics, but the families left to mourn the loss of their loved ones.\n\nThe burden of inexperience is compounded by the siren's call of peer pressure.  For it is in the company of friends that the young are most likely to take the fatal leap, their hormones and hubris conspiring against them.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the correlation between youthful companionship and the carnage that ensues.  The numbers are a stark reminder of the horrors that unfold on American roads.\n\nIn response, various states have implemented provisional licenses, attempting to mitigate the carnage.  These measures, while well-intentioned, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound.  The true issue lies deeper, a systemic failure to reckon with the harsh realities of the road.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has sounded the alarm, suggesting that even the venerable age of 18 may be too soon to entrust the wheel to the young.  His research reveals a disturbing propensity among the young to court danger for its own sake, a reckless abandon that defies comprehension.  It is a tendency that must be checked, lest the death toll continue to climb.\n\nBy 2010, the demographic bulge of the Baby Boomers will reach its zenith, unleashing a tidal wave of new drivers upon the nation's roads.  The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic.  But legislation can still stem the tide.  A national standard, one that prohibits drivers under the age of 18, is a reasonable and necessary step.  Schools can continue to provide the foundation of driver's education, while a provisional permit can serve as a stepping stone to full licensure.  The requirement of practical training hours, a tried and true measure, can be standardized across the nation.\n\nThis is not a radical proposal, merely a recognition of the stark reality that faces us.  The time for half-measures is past; it is time for a comprehensive solution to the scourge of teen driving.  Uniform national legislation is the only way to ensure that the next generation of Americans is not lost to the void of the highway.",
            "In the depths of the Library of Congress's vast repository, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest films, the trick films of 1895 to 1901. Fifteen such relics lay before me, their creaking reels a testament to the nascent art of cinematic deception. My study was to unravel the poetic threads that wove these illusions, to discern the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in the later years. The trick films of the turn of the century were bound by strict conventions: set-bound, frontal proscenium compositions, static cameras, and a adherence to the tyranny of the single shot.\n\nYet, like ravens on the periphery of a dying flame, a few films dared to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations such as the fragmented shot. In these early years, the camera remained rooted, a sentinel guarding the frame of the proscenium, as the figures within danced across the stage. This theatrical heritage, born from the vaudeville and magic acts of a bygone era, imposed its own limitations. The figures, like puppets on strings, moved only laterally, never venturing forth or receding from the camera's gaze. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, as if bound by an unseen force. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, a monolith to the frozen moment.\n\nThe proscenium's straitjacket also dictated the cinematographic vocabulary: long shots and the occasional medium shot, never the intimate close-up. For in the theatre and vaudeville, the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, frozen in their roles, never breached the middle ground, their faces and actions a tableau for the viewer's scrutiny. Hence, the close-up, a tool of nuance and subtlety, was an alien concept in these early trick films.\n\nThe rule of one conceptual shot, one physical shot held sway, limiting the films to a brevity that bordered on the ephemeral. Most trick films, like fleeting whispers in the wind, vanished in less than a minute, their frames a blurred shadow of a narrative. Their focus, a vaudeville-style trifecta of magic, disappearance, and switching acts, left little room for dramatic depth. Yet, as one delves deeper, the façade cracks, revealing the cunning artifice that underpinned these deceptions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion of a severed head is unmasked, the moment of its creation revealed, like a conjurer's sleight of hand. The single shot, a mere illusion, was in truth a collage of joined fragments, a testament to the early filmmakers' resourcefulness in the art of deception.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of America's early years, a figure emerged who would leave an indelible mark upon the nation's formative days. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land and a warrior of conviction, stood resolute in his dedication to the principles of Republicanism. His hands, worn rough from the toil of the earth, had also grasped the reins of politics, tempering his agrarian roots with a fervor for personal freedom and government restraint. The twin pursuits of his life – the cultivation of the land and the shaping of the nation's destiny – had forged a man unyielding in his resolve.\n\nFor Taylor, the agrarian Ideal was the very foundation upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were erected. It was a vision of a society where the common man, untainted by the corruptions of power, might live unfettered by the encroaching grasp of government. In this vast and untamed expanse, he saw the potential for a system of self-government, unshackled by the weight of tradition, to take root and flourish.\n\nThe notion of the \"state of nature\" – a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak – was an affront to Taylor's sensibilities. In a civilization, he believed, this brutal calculus must be tempered by the presence of a government that accounted for the duality of human nature. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he wrote, a dictum that underscored his conviction in the dualistic morality that governed human affairs.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's estimation, must be founded upon principles that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. It was a system that would function equitably, regardless of the administrators who might seek to exploit its power for personal gain. Self-interest, he acknowledged, was the driving force behind human action, but it was only when this impulse led to the subjugation of others that it became a malignancy that must be checked.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor was a proponent of a strict construction of the Constitution, one that limited the Federal government to the powers explicitly granted by the document. He knew that an extensive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, but he also recognized that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the text was fraught with peril. It was a path that could lead to corruption, as the intent of the framers was lost in the cold calculus of power. Even more, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the American experiment, a document that spoke to the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of the endeavor, a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions precipitated a sense of unease. The cause of this decline eluded us, lost in the crepuscular haze of winter's onset. The New England campus, blanketed in snow, witnessed a decline in pedestrian and cyclist traffic, a likely contributor to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought a maelstrom of activity: final exams, grades, and the attendant chaos of year's end. Amidst this maelstrom, the commuter log may have been cast aside, forgotten in the rush to complete the semester's business. The holiday season, too, brought a respite from academic toil, a month-long interlude in which the campus was all but deserted. The resumption of classes in late January offered a possible explanation for the paucity of submissions, but none adequately accounted for the lull that persisted into February. It was as if the initial fervor of the project had given way to a natural ennui, a waning of interest that defied explanation.\n\nIn an effort to counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a high-intensity campaign designed to rekindle the initiative's flame. The results were telling: a surge in log submissions in March, a testament to the power of focused effort. Yet, this success merely highlighted the challenges that lay ahead: how to sustain momentum in the face of seasonal lulls and the deeply ingrained cultural preference for the freedom and independence afforded by driving one's own vehicle. This preference, a pervasive aspect of our society, posed a significant obstacle to the project's success.\n\nThe provision of incentives, in the form of gift certificates to local establishments, was a necessary countermeasure to this entrenched preference. We offered prizes to be redeemed at local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, among other venues. It was a curious exercise, this attempt to nudge behavior through the promise of reward. One could not help but wonder, however, if more substantial prizes might have yielded greater results. A bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle – such prizes might have trumped the allure of personal freedom and flexibility, at least for a time. The value of the prizes, however, remained constant throughout the project. A variable that might have been tweaked to greater effect: had we announced the addition of more substantial rewards, perhaps in December and again in January, the project's fortunes might have been reversed. The gift cards, once sufficient, may have proved insufficient in the face of time's steady erosion of interest.",
            "In the depths of the financial labyrinth, there exists a creature known as the ETF - a hybrid beast that combines the characteristics of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock, trading on the exchanges with the ease of a common commodity.  It is said to offer the diversification of a fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership: the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.  Yet, like all things that seem too good to be true, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund, a tantalizing prospect for the astute investor.\n\nBut, as with all things, there are costs to be reckoned with.  The commission on each trade, a burden that weighs heavily on the investor's wallet, is a persistent thorn in the side of those who would seek to profit from the ETF's flexibility.  And then, of course, there is the question of the ETF's true nature, a shroud of mystery that hangs over the financial landscape like a dark and foreboding cloud.  Does it truly offer the diversification it promises, or is it merely a facade, a clever ruse designed to lure the unwary into its depths?\n\nTo answer these questions, we have chosen to examine the ETF IHF, a creature of particular interest in the financial world.  We have selected the top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the ETF's assets, and set out to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are truly equivalent to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 constituent stocks.  We have also sought to discover whether there exist better configurations of these same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would be a Sisyphean task to include every holding in our analysis.  Therefore, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which will give us a snapshot of the ETF's true nature.  Below, we present the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we have calculated the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings.  The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe data reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a significant reduction in risk.  These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, the possibility remains that these results may be due to chance, and not statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF.  By examining these results, we hope to determine whether the top 10 holdings truly capture the essence of the ETF, or whether they are merely a pale imitation.",
            "In the somber depths of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his unfaltering grasp of the darker recesses of the human experience. It is a poem that burrows into the very marrow of existence, where the veil between reality and the abyss is worn thin. In its spare, haunting lines, Poe invokes the enigmatic term \"Thulé\", a word that echoes through the ages like a mournful whisper. This invocation, noted by the keen-eyed Mabbott, finds its antecedent in the venerable Virgil, who spoke of a distant isle, a Thulé that marked the furthest reach of the known world, a precipice beyond which the unknown stretched out like an endless, dark sea.\n\nBut Virgil's debt to the mystery of Thulé is matched by another, a more proximate and insidious one. Poe's fascination with the German masters, those titans of the Romantic era, casts a long shadow over his work. His affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, and Karl J. Arndt's astute analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\" reveals a kinship that goes beyond mere admiration. Poe's appropriation of Goethe's themes and motifs is a thread that weaves its way through the labyrinthine corridors of his poetry.\n\nIn Goethe's \"Faust\", a work that would become a touchstone for the Romantic movement, we find a poem that bears an uncanny resemblance to \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thulé\", a short, searing elegy, tells the tale of a monarch undone by grief and loss. His wife, a radiant presence, has departed this mortal coil, leaving behind a shattered king, lost in a sea of sorrow. His is a world of shadows, a realm devoid of color, where the very fabric of existence is rent asunder by the weight of his anguish. In this bleak, desolate landscape, we find a dark doppelganger for the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", a mirror held up to the abyss that yawns within.\n\nThe connection between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" is more than a mere coincidence. It is a testament to the crucible of Poe's imagination, a furnace that forges the raw material of his art into a seamless, unbroken whole. And at the heart of this synthesis lies the figure of Goethe, a colossus of the literary world, whose work Poe would have known and revered, if only through his veneration of Tennyson. Poe's admiration for the British poet was matched only by his respect for the German master, whose work he would have encountered in the countless translations and adaptations that flooded the literary landscape of his time.\n\nThus, in the twilight realm of \"Dream-Land\", we find a world that is at once a reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" and a testament to the boundless power of Poe's imagination. It is a world of shadows, a realm of unrelenting sorrow, where the very fabric of existence is torn asunder by the weight of human despair. And at its center, a figure that is at once both Poe and Goethe, a monarch of the abyss, lost in the dark, endless expanse of Thulé.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's laws, a question arises: can a customer, beset by the cruel whims of fate, claim punitive damages for a fall precipitated by an applesauce spill in a grocery store, where the store manager, driven by a hunger for dinner, ignored pleas for assistance, turning a blind eye to the impending doom of others? The cold-hearted pursuit of relief by Jennifer Palmer may find some solace in the law, for a judge is unlikely to dismiss her claim with utter contempt. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall those who venture into the defendant's domain, coupled with conduct so despicable it defies the very fabric of human decency.\n\nPalmer's argument is built upon the foundation of past transgressions: the store's failure to address the spill, despite the knowledge of its probable consequences, is a willful act that disregards the rights and safety of its patrons. The precedent of past slip-and-fall incidents, a litany of suffering and pain, is a stark reminder of the store's negligence. Six such incidents in the year 2009, a numbing tally of human suffering, serves as a testament to the store's callous disregard for its customers.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, a employee, Rich Wayne, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with a warning of the impending danger. Martin's response, a dismissive wave of his hand, a careless acknowledgement that he was too engrossed in his dinner to bother with the concerns of others. The same callousness was repeated when Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, brought the spill to his attention, and Martin's response was one of indifference. And then, at 5:30 pm, the inevitable occurred: Jennifer Palmer, a woman whose life would never be the same, slipped and fell on the spill, her back shattered, her world forever altered.\n\nThe law of California is clear: a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract, if the defendant's actions are driven by \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, a term oft-bandied about in the courts, is defined as conduct that intends to cause harm, or, in its absence, a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "It has been nigh on four years since I wandered into a realm of inquiry, a course on Islam at the CBC, where the fervent discussions raged like a desert storm.  The query that consumed us, like a dry wind, was whether Islam was a creed of hostility.  The question seemed then, and seems now, a pertinent one.  In the crucible of time, since the calamity of 9/11, I have witnessed the media's fervent zeal shift from a scathing vitriol towards Islam, to an unwavering tolerance.  It is a transformation as improbable as a mirage that vanishes at dawn, leaving naught but dust and ash.  And yet, I dare say, it is a transformation that would have been deemed unthinkable in the year 2001, when a candidate with the unassuming surname of Obama, and a heritage so deeply intertwined with the Muslim world, could have never ascended to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a enigma, a puzzle that defies easy solution.  I had always thought, based on the fragmented knowledge I had gathered, that Muhammad was a conqueror, a man who rode the tides of history with an iron fist, compelling the conquered to submit to his creed.  But the biography presents a different tale, one of a man humbled, a man who suffered the slings and arrows of circumstance, and emerged, like a phoenix from the ashes, a martyr to his own conviction.  It is a narrative that challenges my understanding, a narrative that suggests that people were drawn to his message, not by force, but by the quiet conviction that emanated from his very being.\n\nThere are parallels, too, between the ministries of Jesus and the deeds attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, a tale of plenty that seemed to defy the laws of nature, is one such example.  It is a story, I dare say, that bespeaks a deeper truth, one that speaks to the power of humility, of a man who needed no external validation, but was content to live a life of quiet conviction.  But, like a thief in the night, this story steals from the life of Jesus, reducing it to a pale imitation, a shadow of the real thing.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories, tales that aim to provide testament to the veracity of Muhammad's message.  But, like a whispered rumor, they are often relayed second-hand, a story within a story, a tale told by someone who heard it from someone else, and so on.  It is a narrative device that, while intended to convey the weight of truth, strikes me as a thin veil, a fragile membrane that separates fact from fiction.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  But history, like a harsh wind, blows away the veil of myth, revealing a more complex, more nuanced figure, one who rose to power through a combination of charisma, cunning, and circumstance.  And I am left to wonder, what do the faithful of today know of the real Muhammad, of the man behind the myth?",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the teachings of Jesus, like autumn leaves on a forgotten tree, withered and fell away from the tree of Christian thought.  The seasons of history bore witness to a slow erosion, a gradual drift from the original intent of the faith.  The landscape of Christian doctrine, once a barren wasteland, sprouted weeds of tradition and dogma, choking out the tender shoots of truth.  In the present, a glimmer of awareness flickers, a dying ember of a forgotten flame.  The traditionalists, rooted in the soil of their forebears, resist the creeping awareness, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them shifts like the shifting sands of the desert.\n\nYet, it is in this darkness that a glimmer of light will emerge.  A yearning will stir, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to lay bare the foundational truths of the faith.  It will take time, decades or centuries, but the inexorable tides of history will sweep away the accumulated detritus, revealing the stark, unvarnished truth of Jesus' message.  A movement will gather momentum, a tide of reformers seeking to reclaim the lost innocence of the faith, to strip away the layers of doctrine, to return to the pure, unadulterated essence of the Gospel.\n\nIn this great reversal, the church, that stalwart institution, will stand firm, a beacon of continuity in a world in flux.  But the theological clock will have moved backward, its hands unwinding like a spool of thread, as the proliferation of diversity gives way to an eerie uniformity.  Across the land, between denominations, between regions, the differences will melt away, leaving behind a stark, unvariegated landscape of sameness.  The great reversals of history are legion: the crucible of persecution that forged a Christian empire from the ashes of the Roman; the torturous march from slavery to freedom in the Promised Land.  And so it will be again, as the great reversion comes, undoing the tangled skein of history, seeking the lost source, and, in the process, dissolving the rich tapestry of diversity into a monochromatic whole.\n\nIt is in this context that Jesus' words, once literal and unyielding, will be seen anew, as metaphors, symbols, and invitations to a deeper truth.  And what is the source of this great reversal?  Look back, and the history of the faith unwinds like a scroll, unrolling the tale of a people, the Jews, who, in the distant past, knew only the stark, unvarnished truth of the One God, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and the tremulous fear of the divine.  A people divided, a people in disarray, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the rest, each with their own vision, their own interpretation, their own truth.  But in the end, it is not the multiplicity of voices that will prevail, but the singularity of the message, the unyielding truth of the Gospel, stripped bare of the ornamentation of time.",
            "The abyss that lies at the heart of humanity yawns open like a chasm, a void of avarice and self-regard that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a testament to this desolate truth, lays bare the callousness of a society that prizes gold above all else, its people reduced to mere pawns in a game of unyielding progress. The factories, behemoths of industry, loom like specters on the horizon, their smoke-stained spires reaching for the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by unbridled ambition.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words paint a picture of this bleak landscape, the pollution that chokes the air and the rivers is a constant companion to the unrelenting drive for profit. The chimneys, like titans of industry, belch forth their noxious fumes, a perpetual affront to the senses, a testament to the disregard for life that drives the owners and managers of these sweatshops. The fecund pens of Packingtown, teeming with the waste of the animals that supply the meatpacking industries, serve as a grim reminder of the callousness that underlies this system, a system that values the bottom line above all else.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the machine, toil in a sea of suffering, their hours long, their pay meager, their lives a constant struggle to eke out a meager existence. The owners and managers, their eyes fixed on the dollar, care not for the welfare of those who toil for them, nor for the lives they destroy in the process. \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is a cauldron of bitter rivalries and hatreds, a place where decency and loyalty are but a distant memory, where a man's worth is measured by his worth to the dollar.\" The layoffs come without warning, the terminations a mere whisper in the wind, the consequences of which are borne by the workers, left to fend for themselves in a system devoid of compassion or kindness.\n\nIn the era of The Jungle, the law offered little solace to the workers, a meager shield against the unyielding might of the factory owners and managers. The unions, meant to be a bastion of hope, often proved to be a mere puppet of the very system they sought to overthrow, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in serving the working class. The workers, enslaved by the system, were forced to endure the worst of conditions, their lives a never-ending struggle to survive, their worth measured by their value to the machine. And in this bleak landscape, immorality was as inevitable as the rising sun, a constant companion to the despair that gripped the hearts of those who toiled in Packingtown.",
            "In the realm of literature, authors weave a tapestry of meaning, employing various techniques to imbue their subjects with a particular hue. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, is a master weaver of this tapestry. He coaxes his readers into a particular state of mind by juxtaposing words in unexpected harmony, thereby imbuing the ordinary with an aura of significance. The novelist's deft use of symbolism, too, is noteworthy, wherein a single color can evoke a world of connotations. The colors of gold, green, white, and gray – a diaphanous quartet – swirl through the narrative like wisps of smoke, their meanings coalescing into a rich patina.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously crafts an idiom of white and gray, those insidious sibling hues that bespeak the banality of existence. White, with its hint of the rarefied and the refined, is paired with gray, the color of dust and decay. This dichotomy is seeded in the novel's opening pages, where the protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are forever draped in white, their attire a testament to the stifling uniformity of the elite. The narrative is replete with examples of this juxtaposition: Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's soiree, Tom sports a white shirt when encountering the lowly Myrtle, while Catherine's complexion is likened to powdered milk. Even the city's landscape is not immune to this chromatic schema, as Nick traverses the \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the names on his timetable reduced to \"gray names\", and Catherine's apartment a mere \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\".\n\nAs Fitzgerald painstakingly builds this lexicon of meaning, he eventually employs these colors to signify the crushing banality of the subjects they represent. The process begins with Daisy, that enigmatic cipher at the heart of the narrative. After a protracted absence from the color palette, Daisy reappears dressed in white, her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serving as a harbinger of her growing irrelevance. The once-vibrant Daisy is now reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform entity longed for by Gatsby but ultimately bereft of depth or substance. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, with Fitzgerald employing the color scheme to underscore the vacuity of the characters and their world.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful stroke, a deft manipulation of the reader's perceptions, wherein the ordinary is transformed into the extraordinary. In the world of The Great Gatsby, the colors of white and gray serve as a potent symbol of the hollowness at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The land of San Diego County lay fertile, a paradise for the farmer's art, its mild and sun-kissed climate coaxing forth a tapestry of bounty from the earth. Tomatoes ripened on the vine, their red skins glistening like rubies in the desert sun. Leafy greens burst forth from the soil, their delicate leaves a vibrant green, while squash and broccoli swayed in the breeze like sentinels guarding the land's hidden riches. Herbs and tree fruits, peaches and lemons, berries and peppers, all vied for attention in the verdant landscape. And honey, the golden nectar of the gods, dripped from the hives like a blessing from above. Yet, amidst this plenty, a sense of unease lingered, a nagging awareness of the costs of this prosperity.\n\nThe demand for organic community-supported agriculture was a palpable thing, a hunger that drove consumers to wait in line, their pockets deep and their resolve unshaken. Organic eggs and milk, the very lifeblood of the land, were sought after with an almost fanatical devotion. And the farmers, those rugged sons and daughters of the earth, toiled tirelessly to meet this demand, their sweat and toil a testament to their commitment to the land and its secrets.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer was not an easy one. The sun beat down upon their back, the soil cried out in parched desperation, and the pests and weeds conspired against them, a relentless horde of enemies to be vanquished. The costs were high, the labor intense, and the losses a constant, gnawing worry. Yet, the rewards were great, for in this land of plenty, the farmer found a sense of purpose, a connection to the earth that was both primal and profound.\n\nIn the town of Potrero, a small haven nestled in the heart of the San Diego County, a landowner's dilemma played out like a tragedy. A parcel of 160 acres, a verdant tapestry of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, lay before them, a challenge waiting to be seized. The Cleveland National Forest loomed large, a sentinel guarding the secrets of the land. And the ecoregion, that vast and mysterious realm, whispered its secrets to the wind, a siren's call to the landowner's ears.\n\nThis land had been home to the Native Americans for untold centuries, their spirits lingering in the ancient trees, their stories whispered on the wind. The cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, their legacy a testament to the land's enduring power. And now, a small farmer, driven by a dream of sustainability and a connection to the land, sought to claim this parcel as their own.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website, my eyes scanning the digital landscape for a glimpse of the land's hidden potential. And then, I researched the government programs, a maze of bureaucratic red tape waiting to ensnare the unwary. But I persevered, driven by a determination to uncover the hidden paths to success, to find the secrets that lay hidden in the land's ancient heart. And so, I located an organic farm in the same area, a beacon of hope in a world of uncertainty.",
            "In the crucible of negotiation, culture is a fire that burns with a fierce and unforgiving intensity. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what is and what is not, of what signifies and what remains unseen. And like a mirage on a desert plain, culture shifts and distorts, refusing to be grasped or defined. Statements that purport to capture its essence - \"all Russians are stubborn,\" \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - are nothing more than feeble attempts to pin the beast to the ground, to tame its unyielding spirit.\n\nBut the negotiator who would succeed must learn to navigate this labyrinthine landscape, to listen for the whispers of significance that underlie the surface of a culture. For it is not the broad strokes of generalization that will serve him well, but rather a nuanced understanding of how a culture's values and attitudes will shape the delicate dance of the negotiation. When one approaches a foreign culture, the familiar contours of his own world rise up like a specter, casting shadows that are at once comforting and misleading.\n\nTo truly comprehend a culture, one must be willing to immerse oneself in its depths, to drink from the well of its history, and to confront the prejudices that lurk in every shadow. It is not a matter of judging or changing, but of accepting the culture for what it is, and working within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are highest and the odds are against him. And when one finds himself a stranger in a strange land, a respect for the traditions and beliefs that govern the culture can be a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding him through the treacherous waters of the negotiation.\n\nBut culture is not a fixed or static thing, tied to the petty boundaries of nation or geography. It is a living, breathing entity that pulses with the rhythm of the corporate heart. Within the walls of a single company, a culture can be as vibrant and diverse as the individuals who inhabit it. One company may be a bastion of long hours and stern discipline, while another may be a bastion of relaxation and camaraderie. The dress code may be a badge of honor, or a symbol of rebellion. Communication may be direct and brutal, or indirect and nuanced. The values that guide the company may be a mystery, or an open book.\n\nIt is in the values that we find the why of a culture, the unseen forces that drive it forward. If saving face is a paramount concern, then the negotiator must be delicate and circumspect, lest he risk offending the very fabric of the culture. If a culture values the hard-won bargain, then the negotiator must be prepared to engage in a struggle that is both fierce and unforgiving. And yet, it is in the values that we also find the key to effective negotiation, for it is the personal touch that can make the difference between success and failure.\n\nBy understanding the values and attitudes of his opponent, the negotiator can begin to see the world through his eyes, to feel the weight of his concerns and the depth of his convictions. And it is in this moment of empathetic understanding that the true art of negotiation begins to take shape, a delicate dance of give and take that is as much a matter of art as it is of science.",
            "The fool has spoken his mind, \"There is no God,\" a notion that echoes through the hollow chambers of Psalm 14, and finds itself entwined with the thoughts of a man named Anselm. It is a thread that runs parallel to the musings of another, Thomas Aquinas, a man consumed by the weight of reason and the cold light of evidence. We are drawn into a dance of words, a pas de deux between these two thinkers, each one striving to grasp the elusive figure of the divine. And so we begin with a premise, a leap of faith, for the sake of brevity's sake, that both men speak of a God, a God of the Bible, a God of blood and bone and spirit. To invite other possibilities would be to invite confusion, a maelstrom of interpretations that would mire our understanding.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Anselm's words unfold like a tapestry, a slow and deliberate unraveling of the threads of understanding. He speaks of a path that winds inward, a journey into the recesses of the soul, where the proof of God resides. It is a notion that echoes the whispers of the mind, a gentle susurrus that speaks to the heart of all things. He argues that the existence of God cannot be conceived, cannot be comprehended, for it is a truth that lies beyond the reach of mortal men. It is a faith that is inextricably bound to the very fabric of our being, a thread that runs deep into the marrow of our bones.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stands apart, a figure of reason and logic, a man who seeks to prove the existence of God through the cold light of evidence. He presents five arguments, each one a shard of glass that refracts the light of truth, casting shadows on the wall of doubt. He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each one a chapter in the grand tome of reason. He argues that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a thread that weaves its way through the very fabric of the universe. And so, he says, we can know of God's existence, not through faith, but through the logic of the human mind.\n\nIn this dance of words, we find ourselves lost in the labyrinth of their thoughts, searching for a thread to guide us through the darkness. And yet, as we listen to their words, we are drawn to the realization that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a complete answer, a holistic basis for belief in God. Their words are like two sides of a coin, each one incomplete without the other, each one a fragment of a greater whole.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a bygone era, a prince would take his first breath, a prince who would one day be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would stray far from the path of the world, and in the desolate expanse of his renunciation, he would find enlightenment. His teachings, like a slow-moving river, would carve a course through the ages, giving rise to the formidable edifice of Buddhism. The most austere and unyielding of its sects, Theravada Buddhism, would emerge as a bastion of orthodoxy, its contours shaped by the vicissitudes of time. The passage of twenty five hundred years would see the once-pristine waters of the faith become muddied, its outlines distorted, like a reflection in rippling waters. This metamorphosis is nowhere more evident than in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with fervor. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this ritual, their participation a testament to the indomitable will to preserve tradition. Yet, this ceremony, a celebration born of fervent devotion, holds no place in the Buddha's teachings, a stark reminder that the fabric of the faith has been tempered by the fires of time.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community, a tapestry woven from the threads of monastic and lay perspectives, has been forced to adapt its doctrinal principles in the face of forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These forces, like a pair of opposing winds, have buffeted the community, shaping its course in ways both subtle and profound.\n\nIn this discussion, certain qualifying terms will be employed with frequency. The internal and external dichotomy will be a recurring theme. An internal force is understood as a force born of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of its monastic or lay provenance. Conversely, an external force is any influence emanating from non-Buddhist circles. A hostile force is one that seeks to damage or undermine the Buddhist community, its animosity born of a malevolent perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither seeks to harm nor assist the community, its actions often yielding unintended consequences.\n\nIt is essential to excavate the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the faith is constructed. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine corpus, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka harbors the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These notions include the concept of Anatta—no self, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Only through a profound recognition of these concepts can the cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be broken, and with it, the twin specters of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. In the Vinaya Pitaka, a lattice of rules is set forth for the layman and the monk alike. For the layman, five precepts are decreed: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in illicit behavior, and I shall not partake of intoxicants. For the monk, a more austere regimen is prescribed. The four noble truths, the very bedrock of the faith, stand as the most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism. First, the truth that life is suffering, Dukkha. Second, that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, that suffering can be transcended.",
            "The animosity between the United States and Mexico had been a festering wound for nigh on 57 years, its bitter edges sharpened by the harsh realities of a contentious past. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations were locked in a struggle that would test their mettle, a clash of wills that would leave scars that would take years to heal. The high watermark of this conflict came in 1846-1848, when the United States, driven by a hunger for expansion, clashed with Mexico in a war that would leave its mark on the continent. The spoils of victory were Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the defeated nation, their annexation a bitter pill for Mexico to swallow.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident, for the rift between the two nations was rooted in deeper, more fundamental differences. Their cultures, like two opposing forces, had long been at odds, their traditions and values in stark contrast to one another. The material interests that drove them were in direct conflict, a clash of titans that would not be easily resolved. As Schmitt noted, the discord between the two nations was a legacy of the English and Spanish, the colonial powers that had once ruled over them, leaving behind a legacy of distrust that would take generations to overcome (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a tale as old as time, a story that has played out in the annals of history, where nations sharing a border have found themselves at odds over issues both great and small. The United States and Mexico were not unique in this regard, their rivalry a microcosm of the deeper struggles that have shaped the world. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (Pletcher 1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their enmity.\n\nThe issue of religion had been a point of contention, a source of discord that had divided the two nations for centuries. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (Frahm 2001, p. 86), a sentiment that would shape their relations with Mexico, a nation with a strong Catholic heritage. This was not simply a matter of ideology, but a fundamental clash of values, a struggle that would not be easily resolved.\n\nThe distrust between the two nations was rooted in the legacy of their colonial past, the animosity that had been sown by the English and Spanish, the powers that had once ruled over them. This was a wound that would take years to heal, a legacy that would continue to shape their relations for generations to come. As Diehl and Goerts noted, there were 17 disputes between the two nations during this period, the majority of which were territorial in nature, a testament to the ongoing struggle for control of the borderlands (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).\n\nThe border raids, the lawlessness that had plagued the region, were a symptom of a deeper disease, a reflection of the distrust that had taken root between the two nations. It was not until both sides exerted military force on their borders that the situation began to abate, a testament to the enduring nature of their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). It was only when Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States, and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, that the rivalry began to subside (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110). The wounds of the past would take time to heal, but the legacy of their rivalry would continue to shape their relations for years to come.",
            "It was fifteen years ago that calamity descended upon me like a shroud, a mysterious illness that shattered the fragile vessel of my existence. I was a nurse, a calling born of a childhood's stark desolation, a desperate search for the security that had forever eluded me. \"You'll always find work,\" they had whispered, a hollow mantra that echoed through the chambers of my adolescence. And so, though the path of science and journalism beckoned, I chose the safer, more comforting route. But fate, it seemed, had other designs.\n\nForty-six winters had passed, and I stood alone, drained of all but the bare essentials. The meager earnings of a life on Social Security Disability had long since been exhausted, leaving nothing but a hollow husk of what once was. Each day was a struggle, a constant assault on the fragile walls of my self-esteem. And yet, amidst this desolate landscape, one truth remained: I could not have endured without the tender mercies of those who had seen fit to lend a hand. Friends, family – they were the thin thread that had held me together, the flickering candle that had guided me through the dark.\n\nIn a world where certainties are in short supply, where the wind howls and the earth trembles, it is easy to forget the value of community. We speak of rugged individualism, of a self-reliance that would see us through the trials of a fallen world. But I know better. I know that it was not the lone wolf that braved the untamed expanse of the American frontier, but the traveler who walked in the company of others, who shared the burden of the unknown. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but in the company of those who had become family.\n\nI do not dismiss the value of preparation, of stockpiling the tools of survival. I have my own cache of supplies, my own arsenal of candles and matches, my own store of non-perishable goods. But these are mere makeweights against the tempests that rage beyond our doors. While we toil in the garden of self-sufficiency, let us not forget the beauty of connection, the fleeting comfort of human touch. Get to know your neighbors, these strangers who share your roof with you. For in the end, it is not the strength of our supplies that will see us through, but the strength of our hearts, the bond that ties us together in a world that would seek to tear us asunder.",
            "The coils of existence unfold like a tattered scroll, a testament to the unforgiving passage of time.  In this desolate landscape of life, organisms twist and turn, their forms shaped by the unforgiving whims of evolution.  Yet, we dare to ask: what unseen forces govern the direction of this meandering path?  What unfathomable constraints dictate the trajectory of their transformation?  Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 treatise, dared to venture that the zoologist's grasp on the organic forms remained tenuous at best, a fragile web of understanding threatened to unravel at every twist.\n\nToday, we find ourselves no closer to unraveling the mystery.  The threads of mathematical modeling, once promising to illuminate the darkness, remain as elusive as the whispers of the wind.  Yet, we press on, driven by an insatiable hunger to comprehend the labyrinthine paths of mollusk skeletogenesis.  Our study, a tentative foray into the unknown, seeks to marry the discipline of mathematical modeling with the raw, unyielding data of experimental studies.  We aim to unravel the Gordian knot of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep.\n\nWithin the desolate expanse of the shell, a topography of twists and turns unfolds, a testament to the ceaseless passage of time.  The whorls, like the pages of a worn book, turn slowly, each one a chapter in the narrative of existence.  The columella, a spectral axis, guides the spiral path, a constant heartbeat in the darkness.  And at the periphery, the sutures separate each whorl, a demarcation of the passage of time, a reminder that all is flux, and nothing is static.\n\nAs we peer into the shell, a world of apertures unfolds before us, a labyrinth of possibilities.  The shell, a fragile vessel, holds within it the secrets of the ages, a palimpsest of time and space.  We view it from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a different facet of the multifaceted whole.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must navigate this labyrinth, charting the twists and turns of the shell's topography.  We begin at the apex, where the first suture beckons, a portal to the mysterious realm within.  A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two, and we count the whorls, each one a chapter in the never-ending narrative of existence.\n\nAnd so, we follow the aperture, a thread through the tapestry of time, tracing its path through the coordinates of each whorl's center, the horizontal and vertical radius of its path.  This trajectory, a map of the shell's topography, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a fragile, flickering flame of understanding in the darkness.\n\nAnd yet, even as we grasp this thread, it slips through our fingers, leaving us with more questions than answers.  We vary the parameters, modifying the skeletal structures, and the shell, like a living, breathing entity, responds, its form shifting, adapting to the changing landscape of existence.  In this endless dance, we are but fleeting participants, our understanding a mere whisper in the wind.",
            "The stillness of death clung to Indonesia like a shroud, its grip unyielding on the fragile lives of the young.  For a decade, the rates of infant and maternal mortality had held fast, unmoved by the passage of time.  The country's march towards the Millennium Development Goals had been halting, its progress like a man stumbling through a dark forest, the darkness closing in around him with each step.  The waters of progress had been breached, yet the ripples of improvement had not yet reached the distant shores of child and maternal health.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, there was a glimmer of hope.  The numbers told a tale of progress, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, yet the truth was a cruel mistress.  For in the midst of this seeming triumph, the quiet agony of maternal deaths hung like a specter, its presence a testament to the frailty of life.  The skilled hands that attended the births were often those of midwives, their touch a gentle thing, yet powerless against the ravages of a complicated pregnancy.  The numbers, a cold comfort, a reminder that the distance between life and death was not always so far.\n\nThe waters of diarrheal disease had receded, but the children of Indonesia still drank deep from the well of suffering.  The postnatal care, a dark and forgotten corner of the health system, remained a place of shadows and neglect.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4%, a paltry thing, a reflection of the desperation that gripped the rural areas, where the cries of the unborn were drowned out by the din of poverty.\n\nIn the cities, the hospitals stood like beacons, their lights shining bright, but in the rural expanse, the darkness was complete.  The equity of coverage, a mirage on the horizon, beckoned, yet remained elusive.  The poor, a distant cry in the night, their voices lost in the desolate landscape of healthcare, their access to services a privilege reserved for the fortunate few.\n\nThe question loomed, a specter of despair, how to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness.  Should the path be paved with programmatic approaches, a series of isolated interventions, each one a Band-Aid on a festering wound?  Or should the focus be on strengthening the health system, a Herculean task, one that required a commitment to the long haul, to the slow and dusty road of progress?\n\nThe allure of programmatic approaches was great, a siren's call, promising quick fixes and tangible results.  But the cost was steep, the danger of fragmenting the health system, of creating a maze of competing interests, each one a competing claimant for the meager resources.  The duplication of services, a wasteful thing, a bore in the earth of progress, the forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of drudgery.\n\nIn the end, the question remained, a haunting thing, a reminder of the fragility of life, and the impermanence of progress.  How to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness, how to save the lives of the young, and the mothers who would give them life?",
            "In the sweeping expanse of Victorian literature, two novels emerge as anomalies, their twisted threads refusing to be bound by the conventions of their era.  Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, like specters from a darker realm, haunt the traditions of the period, their somber silhouettes cast against the stern backdrop of the aristocracy. These novels veer from the expected, embracing the macabre and the unknown, as if driven by an otherworldly force. This aberration lends depth to their characters, imbuing them with an aura of mystery, inviting the reader to peer into the recesses of their troubled minds.\n\nThe darkness that lay within these characters seethed and churned, like a maelstrom on the horizon. And then, like a fleeting glimpse of the damned, the visage of Sikes and Crackit rose before him, their voices a maddening din that echoed through his mind. \"We were disputing,\" their words whispered, \"and he was caught in the midst of it, his thoughts tangled in the threads of their discord.\" The sound of firearms shattered the air, a cacophony of terror that tore him from the shadows, bearing him away on a tide of chaos. Pain seared his consciousness, a burning brand that scorched his every waking moment, its flames fueled by the anguish that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nIn these dark visions, the lines between reality and nightmare blurred, as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights danced on the precipice of madness. Oliver's inner turmoil unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads woven from the very fabric of his being. The shooting, a moment of unspeakable horror, replayed itself in his mind like a ghastly refrain, a litany of despair that haunted him still. His senses dulled, he was borne away on a tide of fear, his only solace the numbing ache that had become his constant companion. The question hung in the air, a taunting specter, whose cruel hand had brought about his misfortune. Was it his own fate, or the product of forces beyond his control? The answer, like the day itself, seemed to slip through his fingers like sand in the hourglass.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting moment of darkness, lost in the vast expanse of time. It was gone, consumed by the void, leaving only the weight of night, a heavy shroud that suffocated all in its grasp. The hours ticked by, each one a slow and labored breath, a countdown to the dawn that never came. And in this endless night, Oliver's spirit was crushed, his will broken by the weight of his despair, his heart a heavy stone, sunk deep in the darkness of his own private hell.",
            "The dust of recollection settles heavy upon the memories of my time spent in the after-school program, where I labored to instill the fundamentals of reading and English in the young minds of elementary age students. It was in this crucible that I encountered a boy named Adrian, a youth beset by an affliction that seemed at once both confounding and heartbreaking: he could speak English with perfect clarity, yet falter on the most basic aspects of reading. His struggles echoed within me, a dissonance that would not abate until I chanced upon his mother, a woman whose gaze was as foreign as the language she spoke - a language that hung in the air like an invisible veil, an impenetrable barrier that separated her from the world around her. It was in that moment, amidst the silence of unspoken comprehension, that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's troubles lay not in his ability to read, but in his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet, a fundamental building block of literacy that had been withheld from him.\n\nThis story I recount, a testament to the insidious nature of the language barrier that pervades our schools, particularly in a state like California, where the multiplicity of tongues and cultures seems to strain against the fabric of our collective understanding. It is a problem that seeks to confound us, to make us doubt our assumptions and our solutions. We are wont to think that language is a fixed entity, a clearly defined construct that can be learned and mastered with ease. But it is not so. For Adrian, the solution lay in the simplest of measures: a tutor's patient hand guiding him through the labyrinth of the alphabet, the gentle coaxing of sounds and meanings from the darkness. Yet for those children who are doubly bereft, those who speak little or no English, the answer is more complex, a Gordian knot that can only be unraveled through a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a program that seeks to nurture the bilingual minds of our children, is often met with skepticism and trepidation. We are told that it is a costly endeavor, that it will drain resources and yield little in return. But I would counter that this is a misconception, a false narrative that arises from a lack of understanding. The evidence suggests otherwise: children in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers academically. It is not a panacea, but a key that can unlock the doors of understanding for all our children, regardless of their linguistic heritage.\n\nSo how do we proceed? Do we demand that our teachers be bilingual? No, that would be a foolhardy expectation, one that would precipitate a crisis of proportions we cannot imagine. But we can - and must - provide the necessary tools to bridge the chasm of language. We can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever moniker we choose, who are fluent in multiple tongues. We can create an environment that values and celebrates the diversity of our children's language backgrounds, an environment that is as inclusive as it is supportive. In this way, we can begin to chip away at the obstacle of language, to create a future where every child has the opportunity to flourish, to read, to write, and to speak with confidence and precision.",
            "In the twilight of our earliest years, a presence looms, a force beyond our mortal grasp. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others tread the dusty paths of ancient temples, or probe the recesses of their own minds for answers. Many surrender to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, their conviction born of tradition and upbringing. Others, however, reject the edifice of dogma, scorning the notion of a transcendent realm beyond the confines of their own self-absorbed universe. We oscillate between disparate value systems, our spiritual compasses quivering like a compass needle in the void, as we strive to chart a course through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice a low, measured rumble, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless beat on the tin roof above. The gutters groaned, overflowing with the deluge, drowning the parched plants along the porch's edge. His eyes, sunken and haunted, seemed to stare into some distant realm, a mixture of searching and remembrance. Months of illness had leached the vitality from his frame, leaving him gaunt and spectral. His hair, once a rich mane, now hung sparse and lifeless. I felt a creeping dread, a sense of irreparable loss, as I watched him struggle to keep his gaze fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond us. I knew that speaking of it would only amplify the ache within us both, so I contented myself with a tentative touch, moving my chair closer to his, and joining him in his somber contemplation.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest of modern medicine, had prolonged his suffering, rendering him a shadow of his former self. What purpose did this serve, I wondered, as I lay alone in the dark, the silence a heavy shroud upon me. I did not pray, for if a God existed, I had long since abandoned any notion that He listened to my pleas. The thought was a cold comfort, a bleak acknowledgment of the abyss that yawned between us.\n\nI had not wished to witness his final passage, to behold the last flicker of life ebbing from his frame. I could not bear to watch the man who had given me life slip into the void. I wanted to recall him in all his vibrant, unbroken glory, not in the fragile, fading shell that now lay before me. Besides, I knew him better than any, better than his family, better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be a bystander to his departure, a mere spectator to the end of his journey. I curled into a fetal ball, wrapping myself in the shroud of my own grief, waiting for the news that would shatter me.\n\nThe silence was my only companion, a silence that wrapped itself around me like a shroud, unbroken and unbroken. No word came, no solace, no comfort. Only the stillness, and the darkness, and the crushing weight of my own despair.",
            "In a dissonant union of terms, the Gothic novel embodies the oxymoronic conjunction of the ancient and the modern, an incongruity that Ian Watt astutely observes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been derided and extolled, its profundity questioned and its capacity for evoking the 'terrible sublime' lauded by some (Burke). The earliest exemplar of the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the ancient romance and the modern novel to forge a new idiom, a synthesis of theater and nature. In this work, Walpole wove together the tattered threads of medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and tradition, creating a tapestry that would captivate and confound readers for generations to come. At the time of its publication, the term 'Gothic' was a polyvalent label, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was a term freighted with connotations of antiquity and unsophistication, an anachronism in the face of the modernity that was rapidly transforming the world.\n\nYet it was precisely this union of the archaic and the modern that allowed the Gothic novel to endure, its timelessness a testament to its capacity to transcend the boundaries of time and place. As the reader is transported to a world both familiar and strange, the novel's Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, its chivalric ideals and manners casting a long shadow over the present. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms serves as a poignant reminder of a bygone era, an era in which honor, bravery, and competence were the hallmarks of a true knight. This nostalgia for a vanished world was not merely a sentimental exercise, but a cri de coeur, a lament for the passing of a moral order that Walpole saw as being rapidly eroded in his own time.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's writing was a cry of despair, a lament for the loss of a world that seemed to be slipping away from him. His characters, including the enigmatic Frederic, embody the ideals of chivalry with a fervor that is both admirable and excessive. Frederic, a prince of unyielding virtue, has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and his very existence is a testament to the power of honor and courage in the face of adversity. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a man of unwavering commitment to his principles. And yet, this idealized figure is also a product of excess, a Gothic trope that would come to define the genre. In Frederic, we see the apotheosis of the gallant and courteous knight, a figure that would haunt the pages of the Gothic novel for generations to come.",
            "The labyrinthine threads of commerce weave together in an intricate dance, each strand a vital link in the unyielding chain that binds the customer to the raw material, and from thence to the product that satisfies their most primal needs. Supply chain management, a term coined by the sibylline Keith Oliver in 1982, is the unseen hand that governs this odyssey, a conjurer of efficiencies and a weaver of bespoke solutions. It is the master plan that orchestrates the symphony of production, supply, and distribution, a delicate ballet of movement and tempo.\n\nSix discrete elements comprise the nucleus of this grand endeavor: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, sturdy and unyielding, support the weight of the supply chain, providing a foundation upon which the edifice of customer satisfaction is built. The managers of commerce, wise and foresighted, employ these six elements to craft a narrative of service that is at once swift, efficient, and responsive to the whims of the market.\n\nProduction, the inaugural step in this grand procession, is the fertile soil in which the seeds of success are sown. It is here that the managers of industry must attune themselves to the rhythm of the market, listening to the whispers of the customer's demand, and responding with products that are at once relevant and desirable. The market, a capricious and mercurial force, holds sway over the production process, guiding the manager's hand as they chart the course of their endeavors.\n\nAs the manager navigates the treacherous waters of production, they must also consider the complexities of location, that most critical of variables. Where will the product be manufactured? At which plant will it be crafted, and with what degree of precision and quality? The manager must weigh the competing demands of volume and satisfaction, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable hunger for value and convenience.\n\nThe schedule of workloads and the maintenance of equipment are also crucial considerations, for in the realm of production, every detail is a thread in the intricate tapestry of commerce. A misstep, a miscalculation, can prove costly in the long run, a lesson learned by those who have walked the hallowed halls of retail, where the giants of commerce, Wal-Mart and Target, have honed their craft through the meticulous attention to detail and the relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this grand edifice, is the strategic art of discerning the core capabilities of a facility and forging alliances with partners who share a common vision. A manager must navigate the labyrinth of divisions, each with its unique strengths and specialties, and decide which path to follow, which partnerships to forge, and which opportunities to seize. And in this dance of supply, velocity is the holy grail, the elusive goal of providing quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness in equal measure.",
            "The faded words on the cardboard sign above Ellen's head seemed to bleed into the dusty street, a macabre message scrawled in Sharpie: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The stark phrase hung like a challenge in the sweltering air, a jarring reminder of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of this troubled land. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, had been ruled by the iron fist of a militant junta since the coup that seized power in 1962. The whispered rumors of a Saffron Revolution, born from the ash of public protests in 2007, spoke of a nation torn asunder by the monastic robes of its people, and the bloodlust of those who would seek to silence them.\n\nIt began with whispers, a gentle murmur of dissent that grew into a roar, as the monks, those revered guardians of the faith, took to the streets to demand justice. Foreign eyes, those of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, had witnessed the horrors of that conflict, and paid the ultimate price for his bravery. His death, like the countless others, was a testament to the unyielding resolve of those who sought to silence the voices of the people. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the very ranks of the junta, spoke of a toll that far exceeded the official count, a grim tally that spoke of a nation lost to madness and despair.\n\nBut this is a story that has been told before, in the dusty tomes of history, where the empires of old rose and fell, their leaders driven by a lust for power, a hunger that knew no bounds. The Romans, those gods-ordained rulers, had decreed their dominance over their people, while in Japan, the emperor was believed to be a deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of the divine. And in our own time, the echoes of a bygone era whispered through the halls of power, as a president, a man with a god-complex, held court with the leaders of a world that seemed to have lost its way.\n\nIn the annals of time, there are those who bear witness to the horrors of human nature: Tiananmen Square, where the ghosts of the dead still lingered, their numbers lost to the sands of time; the Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of innocents, driven by the primal urges of hate and fear; and the Third Reich, a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, where the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder by the madness of a single man. These are the echoes of a world in chaos, a world that seems to be forever lost in the darkness of its own making.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms large over the jazz landscape, his legacy an unyielding testament to the enduring power of creative vision. It is a testament forged in the crucible of time, tempered by the fires of innovation and the patient shaping of his orchestra. The piano, an instrument that could be as subtle as a summer breeze or as piercing as a winter storm, played its part in the compositions chosen for this exercise, but it was Ellington's genius as a composer that truly defined his art. He crafted frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl like a blooming flower, their individual petals of sound unfolding in a tapestry of rich and complex beauty. And yet, he was not averse to tightly coiled phrases, phrases that coiled around the essence of his players like a snake around its prey, coaxing forth the essence of their unique styles.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early masterpiece, stands as a testament to Ellington's willingness to experiment with the very fabric of sound. In this 12-bar blues, the human voice was elevated to an instrument of the highest order, its timbre weaving in and out of the reeds like a summer mist. The piece is a slow, deliberate dance, its six choruses unfolding like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice beginning smooth as silk, gradually roughening like the bark of a tree. The second chorus revolves around a muted trumpet, its solo a languid elaboration of the melody, replete with the sweet, mournful tones of the blue note.\n\nThe third chorus is a clarinet's lament, its sweeping phrases backed by a piano that trembles like a leaf in the autumn wind. The fourth chorus, a full-bodied echo of the first, sees the brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response, their voices entwined like the branches of a ancient tree. The fifth chorus is a climactic crescendo, the reeds now the initiators of the call, their voices soaring in the high register as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint. And in the final chorus, the voice assumes the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument, its sound a primal howl of joy and release.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a piece recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is on full display, his ear for tone color guiding the intricate dance of sound. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a masterclass in the marriage of vocal and instrumental elements, the two sounds blending together like the colors of a sunset on a summer's day. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington's use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, is a testament to his ability to coax the very best from his musicians, the muted trombone introducing the melody with a subtle, seductive elegance.",
            "The yearning had been a constant companion, a gnawing emptiness that refused to be sated. It had begun to take hold when she was a girl, a tender sprout of adolescence pushing its way up through the earth of her soul. Three years had passed, and the ache remained, a stubborn thorn that refused to be plucked. Her desire had shifted, from a thing to a person, yet the void within her remained unfulfilled. The faces of boys had crossed her path, each one a pale imitation of what she sought, and she had watched them with a detached curiosity, a stranger observing the antics of the oblivious.\n\nShe had questioned herself, pored over the mysteries of her own heart, seeking answers that remained elusive. Theories had been proposed, whispered in the darkness of her mind, but they were feeble attempts to grasp the ungraspable. She had lived, a cipher of uncertainty, suspended between the poles of longing and despair.\n\nBut this was not a day like any other. The house, a sanctuary of calm and tranquility, was rent asunder by the sound of her mother's cry. A scream, a raw and anguished cry, cut through the stillness like a knife. She ran, her feet pounding the floor, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and dread. The kitchen, a place of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos and distress.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face twisted in a grimace of pain, her voice a barely audible whisper. \"Ow...sweet...take me to the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a desperate plea that shook the daughter to her core. She rushed to her side, her hand reaching out to still the turmoil within her. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with concern. The answer was a hasty series of instructions, a directions to the car, and the daughter's resolve was set. She lifted her mother, her strength and resolve mingling with her worry and fear.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a bastion of sterility and suffering. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that clung to the skin. But she pushed it aside, her mind focused on the task at hand. She carried her mother, a fragile, broken thing, to the reception desk, her voice rising above the din of the waiting room. \"Help! My mother needs attention!\" The faces turned, a blur of concern and compassion, and a wheelchair was produced, a makeshift cradle for her mother's broken body.\n\nThe doctors came, their faces a blur of efficiency and expertise, and her mother was whisked away, a fragile leaf on the wind. She was left to wait, a sentinel of worry, her heart heavy with the weight of her mother's pain. The fall from the stool, a seemingly minor incident, had left her mother broken and battered. The stillness of the house had given way to chaos and confusion, and she was left to pick up the pieces, to try and make sense of the shattered world around her.",
            "The dim lights of a distant world cast long shadows across the expanse of our understanding, yet the promise of the Mediterranean Diet beckons us forward like a siren's call.  Its adherents, a verdant host, feast upon the bounty of plant life - fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - their tables spread with the trappings of a healthier existence.  They eschew the darkness of saturated fats, instead welcoming the golden glow of monounsaturated oils into their lives.  And in this quiet reverence for the land, they find solace in the gentle warmth of moderate alcohol, a reminder that even in excess, there is a fine line between indulgence and moderation.\n\nThe whispers of prior studies have long whispered of the Med Diet's protective benefits - a shield against the ravages of total and cardiovascular mortality, a gentle breeze that rustles the leaves of weight loss and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.  Yet, a void had existed in our knowledge, a chasm that yawned wide and deep, unexplored and uncharted, where the mysteries of stroke and stroke mortality dwelled.  It is in this void that our study ventures forth, a lone traveler in the wilderness of data, seeking to illuminate the paths that lead to a healthier existence.\n\nOur journey began with 74,886 women, a sisterhood bound together by the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses in 11 states.  Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, we computed the aMed diet score, a metric that sang the praises of their nutrient intake, their tables spread with the bounty of their self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\"  And though the years went by, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, more than 95% of these women remained steadfast, their participation a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance.\n\nTheir reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records, hospital documents, and death certificates.  And where the records were scarce, we relied on the whispered rumors of probable cases, a shadowy realm where 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts dwelled.  We also calculated the body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, a litany of factors that sought to confuse and mislead us.  But we stood firm, our gaze fixed on the horizon, as we adjusted for these confounders, our steps steady and resolute.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical cartographer, charted the course of our inquiry, its terrain marked by the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  And in the end, our findings emerged like a dawn breaking over the horizon - the women who adhered to the Mediterranean Diet, their aMed diet score a beacon of hope, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke, their relative risk a mere 0.71, a testament to the power of a diet that honors the land and the body.",
            "The darkness crept in like a thief in the night, stealing the very foundations of a nation's prosperity. It began in 2007, a year when the behemoths of American finance teetered on the precipice of collapse. Unemployment stalked the land like a specter, the housing market lay in shambles, and the once-mighty corporations, those titans of industry, were reduced to mere shadows of their former selves. And so, we are left to ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how might we prevent its recurrence? The answer lies in the hubris of those who would guide the ship of state, their decisions driven by a reckless abandon that would have far-reaching consequences. They goaded the banks and financial institutions to peddle sub-prime loans to the unwary, to those who could ill afford them, into an economic landscape as fragile as a house of cards.\n\nThe machinery of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, was coerced into buying and repackaging these toxic assets, creating a Frankenstein's monster of a financial system. And when the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, their reserves drained by the very chaos they had unleashed. The contagion spread, a cancer that would not be contained, infecting the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in 1999, a year of promise and hubris. The Clinton administration, driven by a lust for power and a desire to enhance their popularity, chose to ease lending restrictions, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, penned a prescient warning in the pages of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" His words, a clarion call to beware, fell on deaf ears, and the consequences of their actions would be dire indeed. \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s,\" he wrote, a prediction that would prove all too accurate.\n\nThe economic landscape was transformed by the proliferation of new and complex financial instruments, a veritable Tower of Babel that would eventually collapse under its own weight. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were the instruments of choice, weaving a web of debt that would ensnare the very fabric of the economy. The U.S. households and financial markets, drunk on the sweet nectar of easy credit, overextended themselves, leaving them vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the market. And when the housing bubble burst, the consequences were catastrophic. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that would haunt the nation for generations to come. Bear, Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to a regimen of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their coffers overflowing with mortgage debt, were placed under government control, a testament to the hubris of those who had brought about their downfall.",
            "The stagnant air of exposition clings to the writer's words like the dry dust of a forgotten land.  It is the place where the narrative's wings beat listlessly, a monotone drone that threatens to lull the reader into a state of torpor, their eyes glazing over like the surface of a stagnant pool.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her face a mask of frustration as she wrestles with the siren's song of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition, that seductive fiend, whispers sweet nothings in the writer's ear, urging them to dispense with the tedious details, to hasten the pace and reach the meat of the story.  But it is a deceitful guide, one that promises a quick escape from the tedium of character development, of atmosphere, of the slow unfolding of the narrative's tapestry.\n\nThe cardinal sin of exposition is to tell, rather than to show.  To dump the reader's lap with a veritable feast of facts and figures, leaving them to sort through the morass like a lost traveler in a desert.  In the cinema, it is the awkward exchange, the clunky exposition dump, where one character unloads their entire life story upon another, a cliche-ridden monologue that would put even the most patient viewer to sleep.  In fiction, it is the author's own telling hand that wields the pen of exposition, carving out great chunks of narrative with all the finesse of a hatchet.\n\nConsider, for instance, a heroine whose life has been forever altered by the presence of a man.  We are told of their meeting, of their marriage, of his brutal and senseless murder.  But what of the man himself?  What of the love they shared, the laughter, the tears, the whispered promises in the dead of night?  To reduce their history to a mere paragraph, a cold recitation of facts, is to deny the reader the chance to feel the weight of his loss, to mourn his passing alongside the heroine.  It is to leave their emotions as dry and barren as the page itself.\n\nA writer's task, then, is to breathe life into the bones of the narrative.  To flesh out the characters, to infuse them with the subtle nuances of speech and action, to allow the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their souls.  It is a labor of love, a slow and painstaking craft that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to let the story unfold at its own pace.  For in the end, it is not the telling that matters, but the showing.  The meat of the story, not the bare bones.  The reader's participation, not their tolerance.\n\nAnd so, the writer's hand hovers over the keyboard, poised to strike, ready to begin.  But the temptation to rush, to dispense with the tedious details, is ever-present, a siren's call that beckons them down a path of least resistance.  To indulge, and risk losing the reader in a sea of exposition, or to resist, and risk crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and alive.  The choice, as ever, is theirs alone.",
            "I watched the newscast from Columbus, Ohio, a city shrouded in the hush of morning's early light. The NBC 4 broadcast, carried on the thirteenth of August in the year of our reckoning, 2011, unfolded like a tapestry of violence and despair. The lead story, a disquieting tale of domestic carnage, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a grim rictus, his eyes vacant as a doll's. They showed his mug shot, a fleeting glimpse into the abyss that had driven him to stab his wife, her name left unspoken, a forgotten cipher. The report was brief, a mere two minutes of airtime, as if the gravity of the act was too much to bear, a weight that threatened to consume the very fabric of the broadcast.\n\nThe next story, a somber account of a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed to be devoured by the very shadows that shrouded it. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old youth, lay critically injured, his fate hanging in the balance, a threadbare thread of hope suspended between life and death. The SWAT team moved in, a dark and impersonal force, their presence a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner. I couldn't help but wonder if the news would have given the same attention to a similar tale if the victim had been a different hue, if the neighborhood had been a different shade of skin.\n\nThe news continued, a litany of violence and disregard, a litany of lives lost or forever changed. A gunshot hole marred the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder of the randomness of violence, the ease with which it can strike. A .22 caliber bullet, fired from a rifle, had pierced the metal, leaving a trail of uncertainty in its wake. A five-thousand-dollar reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture, a fleeting promise of justice in a world that often seemed devoid of it.\n\nThe forecast, a brief interlude of tranquility, spoke of rain and thunderstorms to come, a respite from the darkness that had plagued the city. The temperatures, a mere afterthought, would hover in the mid to low eighties, a trivial concern in the face of the violence that had consumed the airwaves.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, unfolded like a tired trop, a narrative of a dark-skinned black man, his features reduced to a mere caricature. He wore a hoodie, a symbol of anonymity, a cloak of invisibility. His height, a mere 6 feet tall, his weight, a paltry 150 pounds, seemed almost laughable, a grotesque parody of humanity. The news anchor's voice dripped with an almost cruel emphasis, as if the man's color was the only thing that mattered.\n\nAnd then, like a whisper in the wind, a mention of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, his fate sealed in a 300-month sentence, a number that seemed to hold a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain gravity that the news anchor sought to convey. But what did it matter, really? Was it the length of the sentence, or the fact that he was a Hispanic man, a label that seemed to serve no purpose in the story? The news, a reflection of our collective soul, a soul that seems to shrug at the violence, the injustice, the disregard for life.",
            "In the vast and unforgiving expanse of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unrelenting. Like a tempest, it sweeps through the souls of two men, leaving in its wake a tempest of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – a maelstrom of fervor that defies the tender mercies of reason. It is here, in the crucible of adversity, that the true mettle of this bond is tried, and the depths of their characters are laid bare. The cost of this union is a heavy one, a burden that must be shouldered by those who would walk this path. To gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, unvarnished and unflinching – a mirror held up to the darkness that lies within.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark upon a journey through a lush, verdant landscape, their footsteps echoing through the stillness like the beat of a funeral drum. The air is thick with the weight of their emotions, as bitter disappointment struggles against the intense pride that threatens to consume them both. It is here, in this fevered moment, that the true nature of their bond is revealed, a tangled web of love and resentment that ultimately proves fatal for one of them. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are given a glimpse into the twisted world of the protagonist, a world in which the lines between good and evil are blurred, and the consequences of one's actions are writ large upon the landscape.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of pride, a monolith of emotion that towers over his every waking moment. From the outset, he is driven by a sense of disappointment, a sense that his brother Doodle, crippled by a weak heart, is a constant reminder of all that he has lost. He had dreamed of a brother who could keep pace with him, a companion in the untamed wilderness of their youth. But Doodle's frailty shatters these dreams, leaving the protagonist to grapple with the darkness that lies within. His heart seethes with anger and resentment, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to boil over at any moment. And yet, it is in these moments of fury that we catch glimpses of a deeper love, a love that is both beautiful and terrible in its intensity. The protagonist's thoughts turn to the unthinkable – to suffocating the small child with a pillow – and yet, it is the simple, unguarded smile of his brother that stays his hand, a reminder of the love that lies at the heart of their bond. It is a love that flickers like a candle in the darkness, a fragile flame that threatens to be extinguished by the very emotions that seek to consume it.",
            "The mind is a labyrinthine repository of unfathomable complexity, a vast and dark expanse of neural concatenation. As the epochs pass, so too do the metaphors that have been used to describe it, each one a faint echo of the truth, a fleeting glimpse of the abyss that lies within. From the wax tablet of ancient lore to the papyrus scroll of forgotten knowledge, and from the book of dusty tomes to the cold, calculating machine, the mind has been likened to each in turn. And yet, it is a mistake to cling too tightly to these comparisons, for they are but feeble approximations of the uncharted depths that lie within.\n\nThe process begins with the influx of sensory stimuli, a barrage of raw data that assails the senses like a tempest: the tactile thrum of touch, the fiery kiss of heat, the sonic boom of sound waves, the radiant flash of light. These primal sensations are transformed, transmuted, and reconstituted by the alchemy of the brain, a process of bottom-up and top-down sorcery that weaves the disparate threads of perception into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nThe example of the black box on a white background is a case in point: the bottom-up process, a concatenation of simple, brutish facts – color, orientation, borders – that coalesce into a nascent understanding of the object before us. And yet, it is the top-down process that imbues this nascent understanding with context and significance, that elevates the mere thing to a box, a container of meaning that holds within it the power to persuade and to inform.\n\nAnd yet, even as the mind processes this information, a filter of attention holds sway, a gatekeeper that determines what is worthy of consideration and what is cast aside. The healthy mind is a filter that discriminates, that separates the signal from the noise, the wheat from the chaff. We notice the name, the loved one, the thing that speaks to us on a deep and primal level, even in the midst of cacophony and confusion.\n\nThe storage of information is a further mystery, a process of encoding and maintaining that is still poorly understood. Sensory memory, working memory, long-term memory – each is a distinct and separate realm, a kingdom unto itself. The encoding of information is a process of translation, a conversion of the raw data of the senses into a language that the mind can understand. And the maintenance of this information, the preservation of the encoded signal, is a task of great delicacy, a balancing act between the competing claims of retention and forgetting.\n\nThe models of the mind, the theories of how knowledge is organized within its labyrinthine recesses, are many and varied. Some are based on the way we remember, on the threads of association that connect one idea to another. Others are based on the cold, calculating logic of computer science, on the algorithms that govern the flow of information. And others still are rooted in the dark, mysterious world of neurophysiology, where the secrets of the mind are slowly beginning to yield to the prodding of science.\n\nBut even as we strive to understand the mind, to comprehend the intricacies of its workings, we must never forget that we are but strangers in a strange land, that the truth lies just beyond our grasp, waiting to be seized by the bold and the curious.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley summons the specter of a dystopian future, where the fetid tendrils of technology and the suffocating grip of capitalism entwine to strangle the last vestiges of humanity. The inhabitants of this bleak realm, conditioned from the earliest stages of their existence to crave fleeting pleasures above all else, stumble through lives devoid of purpose, their existence a hollow mockery of true human experience. The World Controller, an unseen puppeteer, orchestrates this farce, manipulating the strings of a society that values conformity above all else.\n\nAs one peers into the abyss of Huxley's creation through the lens of Marxist theory, the author's seething disdain for the emerging economic order of his time becomes apparent. The Marxist lexicon of homogeny and reification peppers the narrative, serving as a scathing indictment of the insidious forces that seek to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction. The concept of false consciousness, that most pernicious of Marxist theses, is aptly illustrated in the conditioned masses, who are duped into believing that their interests are inextricably linked to the perpetuation of the status quo. The Delta, Gamma, and other subaltern classes, their wills reduced to mere automatons, are ensnared in a web of ideological control, their every whim manipulated by the insidious whispers of the World Controller.\n\nThe hegemony of the upper classes, that most insidious of social hierarchies, is starkly illuminated in Brave New World. The Alphas and Betas, born with the privilege of awareness, yet blinded by their own complicity, acquiesce to the dictates of the World Controller, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of oppression. The relationships between individuals in this dystopia are reduced to a shallow farce, a vacuous exercise in superficiality, devoid of true connection or depth. The interactions between the characters, a jarring cacophony of shallow observations and hollow sentiments, serve only to highlight the sterility of a society that has abandoned the very concept of human emotion.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, love is a distant memory, replaced by a crass and utilitarian calculus, where individuals are reduced to mere commodities, valued only for their utility. The comments of the males, a tiresome litany of objectification, serve as a stark reminder of the ways in which the gaze of the powerful insidiously reduces the subject to a mere object, devoid of agency or autonomy. The females, their voices a monotone recitation of shallow desires, serve only to reinforce the notion that in this desolate future, humanity has lost all capacity for genuine expression.\n\nThe complacency of the social classes, their willing acquiescence to their station in life, serves as a damning indictment of the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience to the dictates of the World Controller, a testament to the insidious power of ideological control, serves as a chilling reminder of the ways in which the proletariat can be duped into believing that their own superiority is contingent upon their continued compliance. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a dystopian future, a nightmarish reflection of our own, where the insidious forces of technology and capitalism have reduced humanity to a mere husk, a hollow shell of what once was.",
            "I have traversed the grounds of University Park for nigh on three years now, the passage of time marked by changing seasons and the shifting landscape of a campus in constant flux. For many, the endeavor of navigating this sprawling expanse has proven a daunting task. In my first year, I was consigned to an East Halls dorm, situated far to the eastern extremity of campus, save for the imposing bulk of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the Willard building, situated near the heart of the campus, could stretch on for a quarter of an hour, nay, even more, should the weather conspire against me, as it often does in this benighted corner of the state.\n\nIn conversation with an alumnus not much my senior, I chanced upon a tale of a bygone era, when the East Halls dorms stood isolated from the rest of the university, surrounded by vast tracts of unused land. Now, those vacant expanses have given way to fields of green, grand edifices, and the creeping tendrils of apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly entwined with the challenge of traversing this ever-growing landscape. Among the solutions to this conundrum, one stands paramount: the humble bicycle. Yet, the bike itself is but a mere tool, a mere catalyst. Students must be willing to wield it, and the campus must be designed with the needs of these two-wheeled travelers in mind.\n\nA friend, recently resurgent in his love of cycling after a period of inactivity, shared with me his epiphany. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to truly move.\" And he was not alone in his sentiments. For in a world where the passage of time is a currency we can ill afford to squander, bicycling offers a most economical means of locomotion. A simple breakfast, a gentle exertion, and the miles melt away like morning dew. I, too, have discovered the joys of pedal power, having chosen to inhabit a domicile off campus, situated at a remove from the heart of the university. My daily peregrinations to the Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep, are reduced to a mere five minutes, should I choose to pedal with a modicum of haste. Alas, the road to my destination, Pollock Road, is not always a gentle one, and the obstacles that lie in wait for the unwary cyclist are many.\n\nYet, I find myself drawn to the bicycle's sweet allure, for walking, though a noble pursuit, is a luxury I can ill afford. Were I to eschew my trusty steed, the sole alternative would be to trudge, to plod through the streets, devoting a full half-hour to an hour of my day to the tedium of foot travel. And that, multiplied by the number of classes, appointments, and other obligations, would consume a good portion of my waking hours, leaving me with little time for the pursuits that truly nourish my soul."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.

Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of a world beset on all sides by the ravages of human suffering, I find myself drawn to the path of social work. A career within the Division of Family and Children Services beckons, a siren's call to those who would seek to heal the wounds of the broken and the battered. It is a calling that speaks to the deepest recesses of my being, a summons to take up the mantle of compassion and to wield it against the cruel indifference of a world that often seems more concerned with the smooth operation of its own machinery than the well-being of its most vulnerable members. \n\nThe values that guide me on this journey are not those of a stranger, but of a pilgrim who has walked the hard roads of this world and has seen the ravages of its cruelty. Service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships between individuals - these are the bedrock upon which I stand. And I am driven by a fierce determination to hone my craft, to sharpen my skills and to remain steadfast in the face of the unrelenting tide of human suffering.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of others, and it was only a matter of time before I found myself on this path. The years spent in high school and college were a crucible, a testing ground where I saw the fractures in the social fabric of our society laid bare. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their faces a mask of denial, while others searched for solace in fleeting escapes. It was then that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a caregiver and to wield it against the forces of despair.\n\nMy journey to this point has not been an easy one. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I felt adrift, unsure of the path that lay ahead. But it was on that summer, in the sterile quiet of a friend's living room, that I encountered a young boy, his eyes a window to a soul battered and bruised by the cruel hand of circumstance. His story is one that has stayed with me to this day, a burning ember of conscience that fuels my determination to act. I drove to his parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding, and there I found myself face to face with the abyss of human cruelty. The parents, their faces a mask of feigned concern, their words a tissue of lies and half-truths, tried to shift the blame onto their son, to portray him as a manipulative child who had brought this suffering upon himself. But I saw the truth, a truth that has stayed with me to this day: that the true monsters are not the children, but the adults who fail to protect and nurture them.\n\nAnd so I began to walk the path of social work, driven by a fierce determination to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Another value that guides me is social justice, a concept that is often trotted out as a catchphrase, but which I believe in with every fiber of my being. I have always been an outsider, a rebel who refuses to conform to the norms of a society that values sameness over individuality. I have fought against the tide of oppression, whether it was the stifling conformity of high school or the entrenched racism and homophobia of our society. I have worn my hair in unnatural colors, pierced my ears, and declared my solidarity with those who are different from me. And I will continue to do so, for I believe that it is only by challenging the status quo that we can create a more just and equitable world.",
            "The darkness of insomnia, a shroud that wraps itself around the waking mind, has long been a subject of study. The twin prongs of the biological and sociocultural models offer two disparate yet intertwined perspectives on this affliction. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving calculus, reduces the complexity of sleep to the binary terms of genetic predisposition and physiological imperfection. The hypothalamus, a glandular outpost in the depths of the brain, governs the delicate balance between wakefulness and slumber, its neurons a symphony of firings and silences. The orexin neurons, those errant violinists, dance with the GABAB receptors, their harmonies a lullaby of sleep, or a cacophony of wakefulness. The study of mice, a proxy for humanity, reveals a truth both banal and profound: the activation of the GABAB receptor induces a sleep that is both a respite and a surrender. The inhibition of this receptor, a quietus, brings a stillness that is both restorative and oppressive. The GABAB agonist, a pharmacological siren, lures the sleeper into a realm of repose, a realm from which the waking world is distant and indistinct.\n\nBut the sociocultural model, a lens that refracts the prism of experience, reveals a more nuanced truth. The inheritance of the phenotypic GABAB receptor, a genetic legacy, shapes the contours of our sleep, a topography of the self. The alterations to this receptor, a subtle yet decisive tweak, can unravel the fabric of our waking lives, leaving in its wake a trail of fragmented thoughts and behaviors. The implications are stark: a life lived in the shadow of insomnia, a life of fragmented days and sleepless nights, a life of halting steps and uncertain purpose.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, the insomnia-ridden mind wanders, lost and forlorn, a pilgrim without a map. The biological and sociocultural models, two competing cartographers, chart the terrain of this affliction, their maps a testament to the complexities of the human condition. But the truth, like the night itself, remains elusive, a will-o-the-wisp that beckons and escapes.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a quiet affliction, a disorder of the auditory realm that defies the senses and eludes the understanding. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition shrouded in the shadows of perception, lies at the heart of the enigma. It is a malady wherein the central nervous system, that labyrinthine network of neurons and synapses, falters in its duty to transcribe the whispers of the world into meaningful sound. The afflicted, though their ears may be intact, find themselves lost in a cacophony of confusion, their brains struggling to untangle the skein of noise that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder's existence date back to the 1950s, when the winds of research began to stir in the realm of communicative disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like beacons in the darkness, lit the path forward with their tests and trials, seeking to grasp the elusive nature of this condition. The work of Kimura, who introduced the concept of dichotic testing in 1961, illuminated the pathways of the auditory cortex, shedding light upon the mysteries of perception. And yet, despite these advances, the disorder remained shrouded, its true face hidden behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that dance upon a wall. The sufferer may find themselves lost in the expanse of sound, unable to pinpoint the source of a noise, or to distinguish between two or more competing auditory events. They may struggle to recognize patterns, to decipher the hidden rhythms that govern the world. The subtleties of speech, the nuances of tone and inflection, may be lost upon them, leaving them bereft of understanding. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, a cacophony of chaos that threatens to consume all. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves unable to synthesize the disparate threads of sound into a meaningful whole, or to unravel the sequence of auditory clues that govern the world.\n\nThe diagnosis of this disorder is a labyrinthine process, a journey through the twisting corridors of perception. The patient is subjected to a battery of tests, a series of trials designed to probe the depths of their auditory faculties. The audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists, like guides in a wilderness, navigate the patient through a maze of questionnaires and surveys, observation and experimentation. But even as they strive to grasp the essence of the disorder, they are confronted with the truth that there is no single, definitive test, no one tool that can unlock the secrets of the afflicted brain. The causes of the disorder remain a mystery, a whispered rumor in the darkness.",
            "In the depths of twelfth night's hush, where moonlight weaves an inconstant veil, Twelfth Night's whispered truths unfold like a tattered tapestry. A deceiver's guile, it seems, is a double-edged sword, capable of piercing the heart with a thousand cuts of sorrow. The outward guise, though a temporary reprieve, can soon become a shroud that suffocates the soul. To shed the disguise, to reveal the truth, is to risk being forsaken by those who once called you kin. And so, the choice is laid bare: to preserve the self, or to preserve the relationships that bind us to the fragile, faltering world.\n\nIn the realm of Twelfth Night, the dance of deception is a waltz of twisted desires, where the lines between truth and falsehood blur like the shifting sands of a desert dune. Viola, a maiden lost in a strange land, dons the cloak of masculinity to shield herself from the ravages of a hostile world. Her ruse, a clever contrivance, proves effective in its purpose, yet it exacts a terrible price: she is estranged from the very women who would have been her succor, her support in a world gone mad. The sea of Olivia's affections, once set upon the shore of Cesario's masculine form, now shifts to the rocky shores of Sebastian's fraternal presence. The tides of desire, it seems, are as changeable as the wind.\n\nAnd yet, in this maelstrom of deception, a glimmer of insight emerges. The masks we wear, the guises we assume, may be the catalyst for the unveiling of secrets long suppressed, hidden deep within the recesses of the heart. Olivia's ardor for Cesario, a flame that burns bright and fierce, may be but a reflection of a deeper longing, a yearning that dare not speak its name. Or is it a jest, a cruel mockery of the societal norms that bind us to the strictures of expectation? The ambiguity lingers, a shadow cast upon the page, a testament to the complexities of the human heart.\n\nIn Twelfth Night, Shakespeare weaves a tapestry of paradox and intrigue, a dance of deception that leads us down a path of discovery, where the masks we wear are but a fragile barrier between the self and the unknown.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of German colonial rule, a bleak tapestry of brutality was woven, most starkly evident in the genocide that ravaged the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, to speak of such atrocities as the sum total of an empire's cruelty would be a gross oversimplification. The German colonial project, a hydra-headed beast, exhibited a maddening diversity in its policies and ruling style, a labyrinthine complexity that defied reduction to a single description. Educational provision, a paltry lifeline cast to the colonized, was similarly variegated, a patchwork quilt of disparate threads that mirrored the fractured geography of the colonies.\n\nWhen the British assumed dominion over German East Africa, a land that would come to be known as Tanganyika, they found a population of Africans beset by the light of knowledge, their minds awakened to the whispers of literacy. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors had earned the praise of contemporary chroniclers. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark contrast emerged, a harsh dichotomy that would leave an indelible mark on the land. Unlike the East African colonies, where the government had taken a firm hand in the education of the native populations, in South West Africa, the task of enlightening the untutored masses was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the stingy support of a government more concerned with the education of its own kind. State schools for Europeans sprouted like weeds, their foundations laid upon the fertile soil of colonial largesse, while the native populations were left to wither, unlettered and unenlightened.\n\nThe legacy of these educational policies lingered, a ghostly presence that haunted the land long after the German colonial project had been extinguished. In South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the cruel hand of colonial fortune. The reasons for this divergence were multifaceted, a Gordian knot of social, political, and economic factors that had ensnared the colony in its grasp. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled threads of this narrative, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the new research that has shed light upon this oft-overlooked chapter in the annals of colonial history.\n\nA vast literature has grown up around the topic of education in the German colonial empire, a sprawling jungle of sources that threaten to overwhelm the unwary scholar. The earliest works, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with describing the contours of educational systems in the various colonies. Later writings, penned in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, undertaking comparative studies of education in the German colonies and subjecting the specific aspects of education to close analysis. These studies revealed a tapestry of differences, a rich and varied brocade that defied reduction to a single narrative. Cohen's magnum opus, a study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a towering monolith in this literature, its influence still felt today. Cohen's research, a probing examination of the educational systems of the two colonies, shed light upon the factors that accounted for their divergent paths.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, presented a colonial authority with a choice: to cultivate the arid desert that stretched across the territory, to coax forth the hidden riches that lay beneath the surface, or to succumb to the harsh beauty of the landscape. The European population, a hardy and resilient people, chose the latter path, drawn by the lure of a relatively temperate climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that swelled the ranks of the settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony, by nearly threefold. The stage was set for a drama of colonial proportions, one that would play out in the deserts and savannas of South West Africa, a drama that would be written in the blood of the native populations and the steel of the colonial project.",
            "In the crepuscular expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, labyrinthine forest, its classifications as elusive as the whispers of the wind. Genres have sprouted like weeds, their tendrils snaking into the earth, giving birth to a proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that defy mortal comprehension. Amidst this tangled thicket, Heavy Metal stands as a behemoth, its dark, Gothic limbs stretching towards the sky like a twisted, cadaverous tree. It is a genre of unbridled expression, a canvas of sound that paints the shadows on the wall of the human experience.\n\nIn the past four decades, the Metal movement has unfurled its dark, sinuous tendrils, embracing a kaleidoscope of emotions, yet fixated on the bleaker reaches of the emotional spectrum. Its offspring, a multitude of sub-genres, have burst forth like a riotous bloom, each one a unique, dark flower. The Metal movement, a churning, amorphous mass, has devoured and assimilated influences from other genres, yet its essence remains a mystery, a maelstrom of sound that defies categorization.\n\nTo grasp the Metal music that surrounds us, one must first confront the void that lies at its core. Metal is a music of excess, a defiant rejection of the bland, the mundane. It is a sound that conjures forth the primordial fears and desires that slumber beneath the surface of human consciousness. The virtuosos of Metal, masters of their craft, wield their instruments like serrated blades, slicing through the veil of reality to reveal the abyss that lies within.\n\nThe darkness that permeates Metal is not merely a metaphor; it is a lived experience, a vortex of emotions that draws the listener in, like a moth to the flame. The psychedelic excesses of the 1970s, a maelstrom of experimentation and creativity, birthed a generation of musicians who plumbed the depths of the human psyche, creating music that was at once beautiful and terrifying. The Romantic Era, with its emphasis on the sublime and the grotesque, left an indelible mark on the Metal movement, its influence still felt today.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that some claim to be one of the first Heavy Metal anthems, distill the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the darker side of rock, it is a declaration of sonic rebellion, a defiant cry into the void. The Beatles, those masters of melodic craft, had created a sound that was at once innovative and unsettling, a sound that would influence generations to come.",
            "The Dream, a painting born of Henri Rousseau's ardent longing, lay in the crucible of his own tortured soul. Conceived in 1910, it was a moment of fleeting insight, a flash of lucidity amidst the unyielding din of his own creative torment. In this work, the artist, a man beset by the abyss of self-doubt, laid bare his own inner struggle - a Sisyphean quest for acceptance, for validation in a world that seemed determined to silence him.\n\nIt was a struggle born of circumstance, of the jagged topography of his own life. A tinsmith's son, raised in the provinces of northwest France, Rousseau's early years were marked by the dull, unyielding routine of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a man of little renown. The name he chose for himself, the douanier, a customs inspector, was a cruel mockery, a mocking reminder of his own pedestrian existence. His first wife, Clémence, died, taking with her eight infant children, leaving Rousseau to navigate the desolate landscape of grief, his only solace the fragile thread of a daughter, Julia.\n\nIt was in this desolate expanse that he found his solace in painting, a refuge from the crushing weight of his own insignificance. And yet, even as he poured his heart and soul into his work, he was driven by a hunger for recognition, for the approbation of the art world he so desperately sought to join. The Surrealists, those mad visionaries, were painting their own dreamscapes, their own private kingdoms of the mind, but Rousseau's Dream was something different, a desperate bid for acceptance, a plea for entry into a world that seemed determined to exclude him.\n\nFor years, he toiled in obscurity, his work unknown to the world beyond his humble circle. It was only when Matisse, that great master of modern art, began to make his mark, that Rousseau's own work began to gain recognition. And yet, even in his success, Rousseau remained haunted by the specter of his own inadequacy, a man forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own self-doubt. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's desire was not to create something new, something bold, but rather to paint a picture so conventional, so acceptably bourgeois, that he might finally be admitted to the rarefied ranks of the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream, that enigmatic painting, is a testament to this struggle, a cri de coeur from the depths of Rousseau's own tortured psyche. It is a painting of a woman, lost in a world of wonder, but also a painting of the artist himself, lost in a world of his own making, forever torn between the twin abysses of conformity and creative freedom.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a faint tremor runs through the fabric of thought. It is the whispered conversation between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. A murmur that echoes through the corridors of the mind, a siren's call to the unseen. For in the words of John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a bald assertion, a cry from the wilderness, a statement that defies the sterile light of reason.\n\nWe think we grasp ethics and aesthetics through the dusty tomes of learning or the worn pathways of experience. But no, they are not so easily captured. They are the will-o'-the-wisps that dance at the edge of perception, always receding into the shadows as we approach. As Keats so eloquently put it, both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe, not to prescribe. We seek to explain the why of a work of art, the why of a moral act, but the words falter on our lips like autumn leaves.\n\nCriticism, that most vaunted of endeavors, can never fully grasp the essence of what is good or beautiful. The critics' words, like the scratchings on a cave wall, are feeble attempts to corral the uncontainable. Consider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile that has beguiled the ages. Do we speak of her fame in terms of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context? No, we do not. We speak of something more, something that defies articulation. A phrase like \"There's just something about it\" trembles on the lips, a confession of the inadequacy of language.\n\nAnd so it is with ethics. Flannery O'Connor's words, like a desert wind, blow through our understanding: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics, like art, transcends the bounds of description. It speaks to something deeper, something that cannot be captured by the words of the wise or the learned. As Wittgenstein so starkly put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence, this je ne sais quoi, that binds ethics and aesthetics together in a bond of shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is both intimate and ineffable. It is a noumenal realm, a world beyond the reach of words. As Kant so astutely observed, it is a realm that is felt, not thought. And it is here, in this hidden place, that we find the connection between ethics and aesthetics. For it is in the art of literature that we find this connection most clearly. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" It is a quality that speaks to the very heart of our humanity, a quality that is both beautiful and true.",
            "The shadows of the Alps cast a somber hue upon the Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of disparate cultures. From the mist-shrouded spires of München to the Baltic's unforgiving shores in Kiel, a singular unity holds sway, a testament to the indomitable will of a people born of the land. The Rhine's dark waters course through the heart of Köln, a city veiled in mystery, while Dresden, a Saxon stronghold, stands sentinel on the Elbe, its stone façades bearing the weight of a storied past. It is little wonder, then, that the culture of this land is a tapestry rich with the threads of countless influences, a testament to the primordial forces that shaped the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name Germania are shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty, a labyrinth of conflicting theories and half-truths. Tacitus, that knowing chronicler of the Empire's darkest hours, posited that the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that had crossed the Rhine, their hearts afire with a warrior's passion. Others claimed that Julius Caesar, that master of the Gallic Wars, coined the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls' own tongue, a distinction between the subjugated and the unconquered. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a chilling testament to the unyielding ferocity of the Germanic tribes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe Old English Dictionary whispers another tale, one of a spear, a ger, wielded by warriors in the heat of battle, while the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" suggests a people unafraid to make their presence known. And yet, it is Tacitus who provides the most trenchant insight into the Germanic soul, his De Origine et situ Germanorum a searing indictment of the unforgiving landscape: \"I should regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans, those masters of conquest, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of disdain and fascination, their legions probing the borders of this unforgiving land, their spoils a testament to the Germanic tribes' unyielding ferocity. And so, the Germanic tribes, a motley assemblage of warriors and traders, lived on the fringes of the Empire, their skills honed in the crucible of battle, their goods exchanged for the fleeting promise of Roman wealth.

            "The vista before me lay shrouded in a dull haze.  My mind, a vacant slate, refused to inscribe meaning upon the scene that unfolded before my eyes.  The image, a jumble of disparate parts, held an illusory coherence, its constituent elements existing in a state of suspended animation, bereft of significance.  Thoughts arose, flitted, and then vanished, their ephemeral nature as fleeting as the wisp of smoke on the wind.\n\nIt was in a moment of fleeting curiosity that I had chanced upon \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist I had worked with had recommended it, and I, driven by a long-held aspiration to grasp the mysteries of line and form, had purchased the book.  The words within its pages spoke of a world where the pencil was not merely a tool, but a key to unlock the hidden harmonies of the universe.  One technique, a simple yet profound concept, had struck a chord within me: the imposition of a frame upon the chaos of the world, a square boundary that reduced the multiplicity of experience to a unified whole.\n\nAnd yet, as I stood before the offending bundle, my mind recoiled in the face of such simplicity.  The mess before me defied the neat compartmentalization of art.  It was a thing, a thing that had once lived, a thing that now lay broken and discarded, a thing that mocked my attempts to impose order upon it.  I thought of the masters: Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's kaleidoscope of color.  And I, a lowly aspirant, stood before this, this thing, and felt the weight of my own insignificance.\n\nMy hand, a clumsy instrument, hovered over the handle of the toilet.  The muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed once more, as if driven by a will beyond my own.  The handle, a stubborn obstacle, refused to yield to my touch.  I stood, a figure of futility, as the seconds ticked by like grains of sand in an empty hourglass.  My grip on the mop relaxed, my feet shifted, and I stared, a man transfixed, at the thing that lay before me.\n\nA few more moments passed, each one a tiny, insignificant droplet in the vast ocean of time.  And then, my hand, a puppet on a string, moved towards the wall, grasped the sheet of toilet paper, and began to wrap itself in a chilling shroud.  I stood, a figure of desolation, and dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a gesture both intimate and grotesque.",
            "In the desolate landscape of America's roads, a terrible toll is exacted upon the young.  Teenagers succumb to the unforgiving wheel, their lives extinguished by the very thing meant to set them free.  The National Institutes of Health have shed light on the calamitous forces at play, revealing that the adolescent brain is woefully unprepared to confront the perils of the highway.  Inexperience, that most insidious of demons, stalks the roads, claiming its victims with ruthless efficiency.  It is a specter that haunts not only the statistics, but the families left to mourn the loss of their loved ones.\n\nThe burden of inexperience is compounded by the siren's call of peer pressure.  For it is in the company of friends that the young are most likely to take the fatal leap, their hormones and hubris conspiring against them.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the correlation between youthful companionship and the carnage that ensues.  The numbers are a stark reminder of the horrors that unfold on American roads.\n\nIn response, various states have implemented provisional licenses, attempting to mitigate the carnage.  These measures, while well-intentioned, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound.  The true issue lies deeper, a systemic failure to reckon with the harsh realities of the road.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has sounded the alarm, suggesting that even the venerable age of 18 may be too soon to entrust the wheel to the young.  His research reveals a disturbing propensity among the young to court danger for its own sake, a reckless abandon that defies comprehension.  It is a tendency that must be checked, lest the death toll continue to climb.\n\nBy 2010, the demographic bulge of the Baby Boomers will reach its zenith, unleashing a tidal wave of new drivers upon the nation's roads.  The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic.  But legislation can still stem the tide.  A national standard, one that prohibits drivers under the age of 18, is a reasonable and necessary step.  Schools can continue to provide the foundation of driver's education, while a provisional permit can serve as a stepping stone to full licensure.  The requirement of practical training hours, a tried and true measure, can be standardized across the nation.\n\nThis is not a radical proposal, merely a recognition of the stark reality that faces us.  The time for half-measures is past; it is time for a comprehensive solution to the scourge of teen driving.  Uniform national legislation is the only way to ensure that the next generation of Americans is not lost to the void of the highway.",
            "In the depths of the Library of Congress's vast repository, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest films, the trick films of 1895 to 1901. Fifteen such relics lay before me, their creaking reels a testament to the nascent art of cinematic deception. My study was to unravel the poetic threads that wove these illusions, to discern the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in the later years. The trick films of the turn of the century were bound by strict conventions: set-bound, frontal proscenium compositions, static cameras, and a adherence to the tyranny of the single shot.\n\nYet, like ravens on the periphery of a dying flame, a few films dared to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations such as the fragmented shot. In these early years, the camera remained rooted, a sentinel guarding the frame of the proscenium, as the figures within danced across the stage. This theatrical heritage, born from the vaudeville and magic acts of a bygone era, imposed its own limitations. The figures, like puppets on strings, moved only laterally, never venturing forth or receding from the camera's gaze. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, as if bound by an unseen force. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, a monolith to the frozen moment.\n\nThe proscenium's straitjacket also dictated the cinematographic vocabulary: long shots and the occasional medium shot, never the intimate close-up. For in the theatre and vaudeville, the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, frozen in their roles, never breached the middle ground, their faces and actions a tableau for the viewer's scrutiny. Hence, the close-up, a tool of nuance and subtlety, was an alien concept in these early trick films.\n\nThe rule of one conceptual shot, one physical shot held sway, limiting the films to a brevity that bordered on the ephemeral. Most trick films, like fleeting whispers in the wind, vanished in less than a minute, their frames a blurred shadow of a narrative. Their focus, a vaudeville-style trifecta of magic, disappearance, and switching acts, left little room for dramatic depth. Yet, as one delves deeper, the façade cracks, revealing the cunning artifice that underpinned these deceptions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion of a severed head is unmasked, the moment of its creation revealed, like a conjurer's sleight of hand. The single shot, a mere illusion, was in truth a collage of joined fragments, a testament to the early filmmakers' resourcefulness in the art of deception.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of America's early years, a figure emerged who would leave an indelible mark upon the nation's formative days. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land and a warrior of conviction, stood resolute in his dedication to the principles of Republicanism. His hands, worn rough from the toil of the earth, had also grasped the reins of politics, tempering his agrarian roots with a fervor for personal freedom and government restraint. The twin pursuits of his life – the cultivation of the land and the shaping of the nation's destiny – had forged a man unyielding in his resolve.\n\nFor Taylor, the agrarian Ideal was the very foundation upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were erected. It was a vision of a society where the common man, untainted by the corruptions of power, might live unfettered by the encroaching grasp of government. In this vast and untamed expanse, he saw the potential for a system of self-government, unshackled by the weight of tradition, to take root and flourish.\n\nThe notion of the \"state of nature\" – a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak – was an affront to Taylor's sensibilities. In a civilization, he believed, this brutal calculus must be tempered by the presence of a government that accounted for the duality of human nature. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he wrote, a dictum that underscored his conviction in the dualistic morality that governed human affairs.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's estimation, must be founded upon principles that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. It was a system that would function equitably, regardless of the administrators who might seek to exploit its power for personal gain. Self-interest, he acknowledged, was the driving force behind human action, but it was only when this impulse led to the subjugation of others that it became a malignancy that must be checked.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor was a proponent of a strict construction of the Constitution, one that limited the Federal government to the powers explicitly granted by the document. He knew that an extensive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, but he also recognized that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the text was fraught with peril. It was a path that could lead to corruption, as the intent of the framers was lost in the cold calculus of power. Even more, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the American experiment, a document that spoke to the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of the endeavor, a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions precipitated a sense of unease. The cause of this decline eluded us, lost in the crepuscular haze of winter's onset. The New England campus, blanketed in snow, witnessed a decline in pedestrian and cyclist traffic, a likely contributor to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought a maelstrom of activity: final exams, grades, and the attendant chaos of year's end. Amidst this maelstrom, the commuter log may have been cast aside, forgotten in the rush to complete the semester's business. The holiday season, too, brought a respite from academic toil, a month-long interlude in which the campus was all but deserted. The resumption of classes in late January offered a possible explanation for the paucity of submissions, but none adequately accounted for the lull that persisted into February. It was as if the initial fervor of the project had given way to a natural ennui, a waning of interest that defied explanation.\n\nIn an effort to counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a high-intensity campaign designed to rekindle the initiative's flame. The results were telling: a surge in log submissions in March, a testament to the power of focused effort. Yet, this success merely highlighted the challenges that lay ahead: how to sustain momentum in the face of seasonal lulls and the deeply ingrained cultural preference for the freedom and independence afforded by driving one's own vehicle. This preference, a pervasive aspect of our society, posed a significant obstacle to the project's success.\n\nThe provision of incentives, in the form of gift certificates to local establishments, was a necessary countermeasure to this entrenched preference. We offered prizes to be redeemed at local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, among other venues. It was a curious exercise, this attempt to nudge behavior through the promise of reward. One could not help but wonder, however, if more substantial prizes might have yielded greater results. A bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle – such prizes might have trumped the allure of personal freedom and flexibility, at least for a time. The value of the prizes, however, remained constant throughout the project. A variable that might have been tweaked to greater effect: had we announced the addition of more substantial rewards, perhaps in December and again in January, the project's fortunes might have been reversed. The gift cards, once sufficient, may have proved insufficient in the face of time's steady erosion of interest.",
            "In the depths of the financial labyrinth, there exists a creature known as the ETF - a hybrid beast that combines the characteristics of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock, trading on the exchanges with the ease of a common commodity.  It is said to offer the diversification of a fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership: the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.  Yet, like all things that seem too good to be true, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund, a tantalizing prospect for the astute investor.\n\nBut, as with all things, there are costs to be reckoned with.  The commission on each trade, a burden that weighs heavily on the investor's wallet, is a persistent thorn in the side of those who would seek to profit from the ETF's flexibility.  And then, of course, there is the question of the ETF's true nature, a shroud of mystery that hangs over the financial landscape like a dark and foreboding cloud.  Does it truly offer the diversification it promises, or is it merely a facade, a clever ruse designed to lure the unwary into its depths?\n\nTo answer these questions, we have chosen to examine the ETF IHF, a creature of particular interest in the financial world.  We have selected the top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the ETF's assets, and set out to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are truly equivalent to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 constituent stocks.  We have also sought to discover whether there exist better configurations of these same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would be a Sisyphean task to include every holding in our analysis.  Therefore, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which will give us a snapshot of the ETF's true nature.  Below, we present the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we have calculated the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings.  The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe data reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a significant reduction in risk.  These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, the possibility remains that these results may be due to chance, and not statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF.  By examining these results, we hope to determine whether the top 10 holdings truly capture the essence of the ETF, or whether they are merely a pale imitation.",
            "In the somber depths of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his unfaltering grasp of the darker recesses of the human experience. It is a poem that burrows into the very marrow of existence, where the veil between reality and the abyss is worn thin. In its spare, haunting lines, Poe invokes the enigmatic term \"Thulé\", a word that echoes through the ages like a mournful whisper. This invocation, noted by the keen-eyed Mabbott, finds its antecedent in the venerable Virgil, who spoke of a distant isle, a Thulé that marked the furthest reach of the known world, a precipice beyond which the unknown stretched out like an endless, dark sea.\n\nBut Virgil's debt to the mystery of Thulé is matched by another, a more proximate and insidious one. Poe's fascination with the German masters, those titans of the Romantic era, casts a long shadow over his work. His affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, and Karl J. Arndt's astute analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\" reveals a kinship that goes beyond mere admiration. Poe's appropriation of Goethe's themes and motifs is a thread that weaves its way through the labyrinthine corridors of his poetry.\n\nIn Goethe's \"Faust\", a work that would become a touchstone for the Romantic movement, we find a poem that bears an uncanny resemblance to \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thulé\", a short, searing elegy, tells the tale of a monarch undone by grief and loss. His wife, a radiant presence, has departed this mortal coil, leaving behind a shattered king, lost in a sea of sorrow. His is a world of shadows, a realm devoid of color, where the very fabric of existence is rent asunder by the weight of his anguish. In this bleak, desolate landscape, we find a dark doppelganger for the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", a mirror held up to the abyss that yawns within.\n\nThe connection between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" is more than a mere coincidence. It is a testament to the crucible of Poe's imagination, a furnace that forges the raw material of his art into a seamless, unbroken whole. And at the heart of this synthesis lies the figure of Goethe, a colossus of the literary world, whose work Poe would have known and revered, if only through his veneration of Tennyson. Poe's admiration for the British poet was matched only by his respect for the German master, whose work he would have encountered in the countless translations and adaptations that flooded the literary landscape of his time.\n\nThus, in the twilight realm of \"Dream-Land\", we find a world that is at once a reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" and a testament to the boundless power of Poe's imagination. It is a world of shadows, a realm of unrelenting sorrow, where the very fabric of existence is torn asunder by the weight of human despair. And at its center, a figure that is at once both Poe and Goethe, a monarch of the abyss, lost in the dark, endless expanse of Thulé.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's laws, a question arises: can a customer, beset by the cruel whims of fate, claim punitive damages for a fall precipitated by an applesauce spill in a grocery store, where the store manager, driven by a hunger for dinner, ignored pleas for assistance, turning a blind eye to the impending doom of others? The cold-hearted pursuit of relief by Jennifer Palmer may find some solace in the law, for a judge is unlikely to dismiss her claim with utter contempt. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall those who venture into the defendant's domain, coupled with conduct so despicable it defies the very fabric of human decency.\n\nPalmer's argument is built upon the foundation of past transgressions: the store's failure to address the spill, despite the knowledge of its probable consequences, is a willful act that disregards the rights and safety of its patrons. The precedent of past slip-and-fall incidents, a litany of suffering and pain, is a stark reminder of the store's negligence. Six such incidents in the year 2009, a numbing tally of human suffering, serves as a testament to the store's callous disregard for its customers.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, a employee, Rich Wayne, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with a warning of the impending danger. Martin's response, a dismissive wave of his hand, a careless acknowledgement that he was too engrossed in his dinner to bother with the concerns of others. The same callousness was repeated when Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, brought the spill to his attention, and Martin's response was one of indifference. And then, at 5:30 pm, the inevitable occurred: Jennifer Palmer, a woman whose life would never be the same, slipped and fell on the spill, her back shattered, her world forever altered.\n\nThe law of California is clear: a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract, if the defendant's actions are driven by \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, a term oft-bandied about in the courts, is defined as conduct that intends to cause harm, or, in its absence, a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.

            "It has been nigh on four years since I wandered into a realm of inquiry, a course on Islam at the CBC, where the fervent discussions raged like a desert storm.  The query that consumed us, like a dry wind, was whether Islam was a creed of hostility.  The question seemed then, and seems now, a pertinent one.  In the crucible of time, since the calamity of 9/11, I have witnessed the media's fervent zeal shift from a scathing vitriol towards Islam, to an unwavering tolerance.  It is a transformation as improbable as a mirage that vanishes at dawn, leaving naught but dust and ash.  And yet, I dare say, it is a transformation that would have been deemed unthinkable in the year 2001, when a candidate with the unassuming surname of Obama, and a heritage so deeply intertwined with the Muslim world, could have never ascended to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a enigma, a puzzle that defies easy solution.  I had always thought, based on the fragmented knowledge I had gathered, that Muhammad was a conqueror, a man who rode the tides of history with an iron fist, compelling the conquered to submit to his creed.  But the biography presents a different tale, one of a man humbled, a man who suffered the slings and arrows of circumstance, and emerged, like a phoenix from the ashes, a martyr to his own conviction.  It is a narrative that challenges my understanding, a narrative that suggests that people were drawn to his message, not by force, but by the quiet conviction that emanated from his very being.\n\nThere are parallels, too, between the ministries of Jesus and the deeds attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, a tale of plenty that seemed to defy the laws of nature, is one such example.  It is a story, I dare say, that bespeaks a deeper truth, one that speaks to the power of humility, of a man who needed no external validation, but was content to live a life of quiet conviction.  But, like a thief in the night, this story steals from the life of Jesus, reducing it to a pale imitation, a shadow of the real thing.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories, tales that aim to provide testament to the veracity of Muhammad's message.  But, like a whispered rumor, they are often relayed second-hand, a story within a story, a tale told by someone who heard it from someone else, and so on.  It is a narrative device that, while intended to convey the weight of truth, strikes me as a thin veil, a fragile membrane that separates fact from fiction.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  But history, like a harsh wind, blows away the veil of myth, revealing a more complex, more nuanced figure, one who rose to power through a combination of charisma, cunning, and circumstance.  And I am left to wonder, what do the faithful of today know of the real Muhammad, of the man behind the myth?",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the teachings of Jesus, like autumn leaves on a forgotten tree, withered and fell away from the tree of Christian thought.  The seasons of history bore witness to a slow erosion, a gradual drift from the original intent of the faith.  The landscape of Christian doctrine, once a barren wasteland, sprouted weeds of tradition and dogma, choking out the tender shoots of truth.  In the present, a glimmer of awareness flickers, a dying ember of a forgotten flame.  The traditionalists, rooted in the soil of their forebears, resist the creeping awareness, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them shifts like the shifting sands of the desert.\n\nYet, it is in this darkness that a glimmer of light will emerge.  A yearning will stir, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to lay bare the foundational truths of the faith.  It will take time, decades or centuries, but the inexorable tides of history will sweep away the accumulated detritus, revealing the stark, unvarnished truth of Jesus' message.  A movement will gather momentum, a tide of reformers seeking to reclaim the lost innocence of the faith, to strip away the layers of doctrine, to return to the pure, unadulterated essence of the Gospel.\n\nIn this great reversal, the church, that stalwart institution, will stand firm, a beacon of continuity in a world in flux.  But the theological clock will have moved backward, its hands unwinding like a spool of thread, as the proliferation of diversity gives way to an eerie uniformity.  Across the land, between denominations, between regions, the differences will melt away, leaving behind a stark, unvariegated landscape of sameness.  The great reversals of history are legion: the crucible of persecution that forged a Christian empire from the ashes of the Roman; the torturous march from slavery to freedom in the Promised Land.  And so it will be again, as the great reversion comes, undoing the tangled skein of history, seeking the lost source, and, in the process, dissolving the rich tapestry of diversity into a monochromatic whole.\n\nIt is in this context that Jesus' words, once literal and unyielding, will be seen anew, as metaphors, symbols, and invitations to a deeper truth.  And what is the source of this great reversal?  Look back, and the history of the faith unwinds like a scroll, unrolling the tale of a people, the Jews, who, in the distant past, knew only the stark, unvarnished truth of the One God, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and the tremulous fear of the divine.  A people divided, a people in disarray, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the rest, each with their own vision, their own interpretation, their own truth.  But in the end, it is not the multiplicity of voices that will prevail, but the singularity of the message, the unyielding truth of the Gospel, stripped bare of the ornamentation of time.",
            "The abyss that lies at the heart of humanity yawns open like a chasm, a void of avarice and self-regard that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a testament to this desolate truth, lays bare the callousness of a society that prizes gold above all else, its people reduced to mere pawns in a game of unyielding progress. The factories, behemoths of industry, loom like specters on the horizon, their smoke-stained spires reaching for the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by unbridled ambition.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words paint a picture of this bleak landscape, the pollution that chokes the air and the rivers is a constant companion to the unrelenting drive for profit. The chimneys, like titans of industry, belch forth their noxious fumes, a perpetual affront to the senses, a testament to the disregard for life that drives the owners and managers of these sweatshops. The fecund pens of Packingtown, teeming with the waste of the animals that supply the meatpacking industries, serve as a grim reminder of the callousness that underlies this system, a system that values the bottom line above all else.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the machine, toil in a sea of suffering, their hours long, their pay meager, their lives a constant struggle to eke out a meager existence. The owners and managers, their eyes fixed on the dollar, care not for the welfare of those who toil for them, nor for the lives they destroy in the process. \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is a cauldron of bitter rivalries and hatreds, a place where decency and loyalty are but a distant memory, where a man's worth is measured by his worth to the dollar.\" The layoffs come without warning, the terminations a mere whisper in the wind, the consequences of which are borne by the workers, left to fend for themselves in a system devoid of compassion or kindness.\n\nIn the era of The Jungle, the law offered little solace to the workers, a meager shield against the unyielding might of the factory owners and managers. The unions, meant to be a bastion of hope, often proved to be a mere puppet of the very system they sought to overthrow, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in serving the working class. The workers, enslaved by the system, were forced to endure the worst of conditions, their lives a never-ending struggle to survive, their worth measured by their value to the machine. And in this bleak landscape, immorality was as inevitable as the rising sun, a constant companion to the despair that gripped the hearts of those who toiled in Packingtown.",
            "In the realm of literature, authors weave a tapestry of meaning, employing various techniques to imbue their subjects with a particular hue. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, is a master weaver of this tapestry. He coaxes his readers into a particular state of mind by juxtaposing words in unexpected harmony, thereby imbuing the ordinary with an aura of significance. The novelist's deft use of symbolism, too, is noteworthy, wherein a single color can evoke a world of connotations. The colors of gold, green, white, and gray – a diaphanous quartet – swirl through the narrative like wisps of smoke, their meanings coalescing into a rich patina.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously crafts an idiom of white and gray, those insidious sibling hues that bespeak the banality of existence. White, with its hint of the rarefied and the refined, is paired with gray, the color of dust and decay. This dichotomy is seeded in the novel's opening pages, where the protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are forever draped in white, their attire a testament to the stifling uniformity of the elite. The narrative is replete with examples of this juxtaposition: Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's soiree, Tom sports a white shirt when encountering the lowly Myrtle, while Catherine's complexion is likened to powdered milk. Even the city's landscape is not immune to this chromatic schema, as Nick traverses the \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the names on his timetable reduced to \"gray names\", and Catherine's apartment a mere \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\".\n\nAs Fitzgerald painstakingly builds this lexicon of meaning, he eventually employs these colors to signify the crushing banality of the subjects they represent. The process begins with Daisy, that enigmatic cipher at the heart of the narrative. After a protracted absence from the color palette, Daisy reappears dressed in white, her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serving as a harbinger of her growing irrelevance. The once-vibrant Daisy is now reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform entity longed for by Gatsby but ultimately bereft of depth or substance. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, with Fitzgerald employing the color scheme to underscore the vacuity of the characters and their world.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful stroke, a deft manipulation of the reader's perceptions, wherein the ordinary is transformed into the extraordinary. In the world of The Great Gatsby, the colors of white and gray serve as a potent symbol of the hollowness at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The land of San Diego County lay fertile, a paradise for the farmer's art, its mild and sun-kissed climate coaxing forth a tapestry of bounty from the earth. Tomatoes ripened on the vine, their red skins glistening like rubies in the desert sun. Leafy greens burst forth from the soil, their delicate leaves a vibrant green, while squash and broccoli swayed in the breeze like sentinels guarding the land's hidden riches. Herbs and tree fruits, peaches and lemons, berries and peppers, all vied for attention in the verdant landscape. And honey, the golden nectar of the gods, dripped from the hives like a blessing from above. Yet, amidst this plenty, a sense of unease lingered, a nagging awareness of the costs of this prosperity.\n\nThe demand for organic community-supported agriculture was a palpable thing, a hunger that drove consumers to wait in line, their pockets deep and their resolve unshaken. Organic eggs and milk, the very lifeblood of the land, were sought after with an almost fanatical devotion. And the farmers, those rugged sons and daughters of the earth, toiled tirelessly to meet this demand, their sweat and toil a testament to their commitment to the land and its secrets.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer was not an easy one. The sun beat down upon their back, the soil cried out in parched desperation, and the pests and weeds conspired against them, a relentless horde of enemies to be vanquished. The costs were high, the labor intense, and the losses a constant, gnawing worry. Yet, the rewards were great, for in this land of plenty, the farmer found a sense of purpose, a connection to the earth that was both primal and profound.\n\nIn the town of Potrero, a small haven nestled in the heart of the San Diego County, a landowner's dilemma played out like a tragedy. A parcel of 160 acres, a verdant tapestry of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, lay before them, a challenge waiting to be seized. The Cleveland National Forest loomed large, a sentinel guarding the secrets of the land. And the ecoregion, that vast and mysterious realm, whispered its secrets to the wind, a siren's call to the landowner's ears.\n\nThis land had been home to the Native Americans for untold centuries, their spirits lingering in the ancient trees, their stories whispered on the wind. The cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, their legacy a testament to the land's enduring power. And now, a small farmer, driven by a dream of sustainability and a connection to the land, sought to claim this parcel as their own.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website, my eyes scanning the digital landscape for a glimpse of the land's hidden potential. And then, I researched the government programs, a maze of bureaucratic red tape waiting to ensnare the unwary. But I persevered, driven by a determination to uncover the hidden paths to success, to find the secrets that lay hidden in the land's ancient heart. And so, I located an organic farm in the same area, a beacon of hope in a world of uncertainty.",
            "In the crucible of negotiation, culture is a fire that burns with a fierce and unforgiving intensity. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what is and what is not, of what signifies and what remains unseen. And like a mirage on a desert plain, culture shifts and distorts, refusing to be grasped or defined. Statements that purport to capture its essence - \"all Russians are stubborn,\" \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - are nothing more than feeble attempts to pin the beast to the ground, to tame its unyielding spirit.\n\nBut the negotiator who would succeed must learn to navigate this labyrinthine landscape, to listen for the whispers of significance that underlie the surface of a culture. For it is not the broad strokes of generalization that will serve him well, but rather a nuanced understanding of how a culture's values and attitudes will shape the delicate dance of the negotiation. When one approaches a foreign culture, the familiar contours of his own world rise up like a specter, casting shadows that are at once comforting and misleading.\n\nTo truly comprehend a culture, one must be willing to immerse oneself in its depths, to drink from the well of its history, and to confront the prejudices that lurk in every shadow. It is not a matter of judging or changing, but of accepting the culture for what it is, and working within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are highest and the odds are against him. And when one finds himself a stranger in a strange land, a respect for the traditions and beliefs that govern the culture can be a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding him through the treacherous waters of the negotiation.\n\nBut culture is not a fixed or static thing, tied to the petty boundaries of nation or geography. It is a living, breathing entity that pulses with the rhythm of the corporate heart. Within the walls of a single company, a culture can be as vibrant and diverse as the individuals who inhabit it. One company may be a bastion of long hours and stern discipline, while another may be a bastion of relaxation and camaraderie. The dress code may be a badge of honor, or a symbol of rebellion. Communication may be direct and brutal, or indirect and nuanced. The values that guide the company may be a mystery, or an open book.\n\nIt is in the values that we find the why of a culture, the unseen forces that drive it forward. If saving face is a paramount concern, then the negotiator must be delicate and circumspect, lest he risk offending the very fabric of the culture. If a culture values the hard-won bargain, then the negotiator must be prepared to engage in a struggle that is both fierce and unforgiving. And yet, it is in the values that we also find the key to effective negotiation, for it is the personal touch that can make the difference between success and failure.\n\nBy understanding the values and attitudes of his opponent, the negotiator can begin to see the world through his eyes, to feel the weight of his concerns and the depth of his convictions. And it is in this moment of empathetic understanding that the true art of negotiation begins to take shape, a delicate dance of give and take that is as much a matter of art as it is of science.",
            "The fool has spoken his mind, \"There is no God,\" a notion that echoes through the hollow chambers of Psalm 14, and finds itself entwined with the thoughts of a man named Anselm. It is a thread that runs parallel to the musings of another, Thomas Aquinas, a man consumed by the weight of reason and the cold light of evidence. We are drawn into a dance of words, a pas de deux between these two thinkers, each one striving to grasp the elusive figure of the divine. And so we begin with a premise, a leap of faith, for the sake of brevity's sake, that both men speak of a God, a God of the Bible, a God of blood and bone and spirit. To invite other possibilities would be to invite confusion, a maelstrom of interpretations that would mire our understanding.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Anselm's words unfold like a tapestry, a slow and deliberate unraveling of the threads of understanding. He speaks of a path that winds inward, a journey into the recesses of the soul, where the proof of God resides. It is a notion that echoes the whispers of the mind, a gentle susurrus that speaks to the heart of all things. He argues that the existence of God cannot be conceived, cannot be comprehended, for it is a truth that lies beyond the reach of mortal men. It is a faith that is inextricably bound to the very fabric of our being, a thread that runs deep into the marrow of our bones.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stands apart, a figure of reason and logic, a man who seeks to prove the existence of God through the cold light of evidence. He presents five arguments, each one a shard of glass that refracts the light of truth, casting shadows on the wall of doubt. He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each one a chapter in the grand tome of reason. He argues that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a thread that weaves its way through the very fabric of the universe. And so, he says, we can know of God's existence, not through faith, but through the logic of the human mind.\n\nIn this dance of words, we find ourselves lost in the labyrinth of their thoughts, searching for a thread to guide us through the darkness. And yet, as we listen to their words, we are drawn to the realization that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a complete answer, a holistic basis for belief in God. Their words are like two sides of a coin, each one incomplete without the other, each one a fragment of a greater whole.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a bygone era, a prince would take his first breath, a prince who would one day be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would stray far from the path of the world, and in the desolate expanse of his renunciation, he would find enlightenment. His teachings, like a slow-moving river, would carve a course through the ages, giving rise to the formidable edifice of Buddhism. The most austere and unyielding of its sects, Theravada Buddhism, would emerge as a bastion of orthodoxy, its contours shaped by the vicissitudes of time. The passage of twenty five hundred years would see the once-pristine waters of the faith become muddied, its outlines distorted, like a reflection in rippling waters. This metamorphosis is nowhere more evident than in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with fervor. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this ritual, their participation a testament to the indomitable will to preserve tradition. Yet, this ceremony, a celebration born of fervent devotion, holds no place in the Buddha's teachings, a stark reminder that the fabric of the faith has been tempered by the fires of time.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community, a tapestry woven from the threads of monastic and lay perspectives, has been forced to adapt its doctrinal principles in the face of forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These forces, like a pair of opposing winds, have buffeted the community, shaping its course in ways both subtle and profound.\n\nIn this discussion, certain qualifying terms will be employed with frequency. The internal and external dichotomy will be a recurring theme. An internal force is understood as a force born of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of its monastic or lay provenance. Conversely, an external force is any influence emanating from non-Buddhist circles. A hostile force is one that seeks to damage or undermine the Buddhist community, its animosity born of a malevolent perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither seeks to harm nor assist the community, its actions often yielding unintended consequences.\n\nIt is essential to excavate the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the faith is constructed. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine corpus, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka harbors the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These notions include the concept of Anatta—no self, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Only through a profound recognition of these concepts can the cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be broken, and with it, the twin specters of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. In the Vinaya Pitaka, a lattice of rules is set forth for the layman and the monk alike. For the layman, five precepts are decreed: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in illicit behavior, and I shall not partake of intoxicants. For the monk, a more austere regimen is prescribed. The four noble truths, the very bedrock of the faith, stand as the most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism. First, the truth that life is suffering, Dukkha. Second, that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, that suffering can be transcended.",
            "The animosity between the United States and Mexico had been a festering wound for nigh on 57 years, its bitter edges sharpened by the harsh realities of a contentious past. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations were locked in a struggle that would test their mettle, a clash of wills that would leave scars that would take years to heal. The high watermark of this conflict came in 1846-1848, when the United States, driven by a hunger for expansion, clashed with Mexico in a war that would leave its mark on the continent. The spoils of victory were Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the defeated nation, their annexation a bitter pill for Mexico to swallow.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident, for the rift between the two nations was rooted in deeper, more fundamental differences. Their cultures, like two opposing forces, had long been at odds, their traditions and values in stark contrast to one another. The material interests that drove them were in direct conflict, a clash of titans that would not be easily resolved. As Schmitt noted, the discord between the two nations was a legacy of the English and Spanish, the colonial powers that had once ruled over them, leaving behind a legacy of distrust that would take generations to overcome (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a tale as old as time, a story that has played out in the annals of history, where nations sharing a border have found themselves at odds over issues both great and small. The United States and Mexico were not unique in this regard, their rivalry a microcosm of the deeper struggles that have shaped the world. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (Pletcher 1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their enmity.\n\nThe issue of religion had been a point of contention, a source of discord that had divided the two nations for centuries. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (Frahm 2001, p. 86), a sentiment that would shape their relations with Mexico, a nation with a strong Catholic heritage. This was not simply a matter of ideology, but a fundamental clash of values, a struggle that would not be easily resolved.\n\nThe distrust between the two nations was rooted in the legacy of their colonial past, the animosity that had been sown by the English and Spanish, the powers that had once ruled over them. This was a wound that would take years to heal, a legacy that would continue to shape their relations for generations to come. As Diehl and Goerts noted, there were 17 disputes between the two nations during this period, the majority of which were territorial in nature, a testament to the ongoing struggle for control of the borderlands (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).\n\nThe border raids, the lawlessness that had plagued the region, were a symptom of a deeper disease, a reflection of the distrust that had taken root between the two nations. It was not until both sides exerted military force on their borders that the situation began to abate, a testament to the enduring nature of their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). It was only when Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States, and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, that the rivalry began to subside (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110). The wounds of the past would take time to heal, but the legacy of their rivalry would continue to shape their relations for years to come.",
            "It was fifteen years ago that calamity descended upon me like a shroud, a mysterious illness that shattered the fragile vessel of my existence. I was a nurse, a calling born of a childhood's stark desolation, a desperate search for the security that had forever eluded me. \"You'll always find work,\" they had whispered, a hollow mantra that echoed through the chambers of my adolescence. And so, though the path of science and journalism beckoned, I chose the safer, more comforting route. But fate, it seemed, had other designs.\n\nForty-six winters had passed, and I stood alone, drained of all but the bare essentials. The meager earnings of a life on Social Security Disability had long since been exhausted, leaving nothing but a hollow husk of what once was. Each day was a struggle, a constant assault on the fragile walls of my self-esteem. And yet, amidst this desolate landscape, one truth remained: I could not have endured without the tender mercies of those who had seen fit to lend a hand. Friends, family – they were the thin thread that had held me together, the flickering candle that had guided me through the dark.\n\nIn a world where certainties are in short supply, where the wind howls and the earth trembles, it is easy to forget the value of community. We speak of rugged individualism, of a self-reliance that would see us through the trials of a fallen world. But I know better. I know that it was not the lone wolf that braved the untamed expanse of the American frontier, but the traveler who walked in the company of others, who shared the burden of the unknown. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but in the company of those who had become family.\n\nI do not dismiss the value of preparation, of stockpiling the tools of survival. I have my own cache of supplies, my own arsenal of candles and matches, my own store of non-perishable goods. But these are mere makeweights against the tempests that rage beyond our doors. While we toil in the garden of self-sufficiency, let us not forget the beauty of connection, the fleeting comfort of human touch. Get to know your neighbors, these strangers who share your roof with you. For in the end, it is not the strength of our supplies that will see us through, but the strength of our hearts, the bond that ties us together in a world that would seek to tear us asunder.",
            "The coils of existence unfold like a tattered scroll, a testament to the unforgiving passage of time.  In this desolate landscape of life, organisms twist and turn, their forms shaped by the unforgiving whims of evolution.  Yet, we dare to ask: what unseen forces govern the direction of this meandering path?  What unfathomable constraints dictate the trajectory of their transformation?  Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 treatise, dared to venture that the zoologist's grasp on the organic forms remained tenuous at best, a fragile web of understanding threatened to unravel at every twist.\n\nToday, we find ourselves no closer to unraveling the mystery.  The threads of mathematical modeling, once promising to illuminate the darkness, remain as elusive as the whispers of the wind.  Yet, we press on, driven by an insatiable hunger to comprehend the labyrinthine paths of mollusk skeletogenesis.  Our study, a tentative foray into the unknown, seeks to marry the discipline of mathematical modeling with the raw, unyielding data of experimental studies.  We aim to unravel the Gordian knot of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep.\n\nWithin the desolate expanse of the shell, a topography of twists and turns unfolds, a testament to the ceaseless passage of time.  The whorls, like the pages of a worn book, turn slowly, each one a chapter in the narrative of existence.  The columella, a spectral axis, guides the spiral path, a constant heartbeat in the darkness.  And at the periphery, the sutures separate each whorl, a demarcation of the passage of time, a reminder that all is flux, and nothing is static.\n\nAs we peer into the shell, a world of apertures unfolds before us, a labyrinth of possibilities.  The shell, a fragile vessel, holds within it the secrets of the ages, a palimpsest of time and space.  We view it from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a different facet of the multifaceted whole.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must navigate this labyrinth, charting the twists and turns of the shell's topography.  We begin at the apex, where the first suture beckons, a portal to the mysterious realm within.  A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two, and we count the whorls, each one a chapter in the never-ending narrative of existence.\n\nAnd so, we follow the aperture, a thread through the tapestry of time, tracing its path through the coordinates of each whorl's center, the horizontal and vertical radius of its path.  This trajectory, a map of the shell's topography, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a fragile, flickering flame of understanding in the darkness.\n\nAnd yet, even as we grasp this thread, it slips through our fingers, leaving us with more questions than answers.  We vary the parameters, modifying the skeletal structures, and the shell, like a living, breathing entity, responds, its form shifting, adapting to the changing landscape of existence.  In this endless dance, we are but fleeting participants, our understanding a mere whisper in the wind.",
            "The stillness of death clung to Indonesia like a shroud, its grip unyielding on the fragile lives of the young.  For a decade, the rates of infant and maternal mortality had held fast, unmoved by the passage of time.  The country's march towards the Millennium Development Goals had been halting, its progress like a man stumbling through a dark forest, the darkness closing in around him with each step.  The waters of progress had been breached, yet the ripples of improvement had not yet reached the distant shores of child and maternal health.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, there was a glimmer of hope.  The numbers told a tale of progress, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, yet the truth was a cruel mistress.  For in the midst of this seeming triumph, the quiet agony of maternal deaths hung like a specter, its presence a testament to the frailty of life.  The skilled hands that attended the births were often those of midwives, their touch a gentle thing, yet powerless against the ravages of a complicated pregnancy.  The numbers, a cold comfort, a reminder that the distance between life and death was not always so far.\n\nThe waters of diarrheal disease had receded, but the children of Indonesia still drank deep from the well of suffering.  The postnatal care, a dark and forgotten corner of the health system, remained a place of shadows and neglect.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4%, a paltry thing, a reflection of the desperation that gripped the rural areas, where the cries of the unborn were drowned out by the din of poverty.\n\nIn the cities, the hospitals stood like beacons, their lights shining bright, but in the rural expanse, the darkness was complete.  The equity of coverage, a mirage on the horizon, beckoned, yet remained elusive.  The poor, a distant cry in the night, their voices lost in the desolate landscape of healthcare, their access to services a privilege reserved for the fortunate few.\n\nThe question loomed, a specter of despair, how to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness.  Should the path be paved with programmatic approaches, a series of isolated interventions, each one a Band-Aid on a festering wound?  Or should the focus be on strengthening the health system, a Herculean task, one that required a commitment to the long haul, to the slow and dusty road of progress?\n\nThe allure of programmatic approaches was great, a siren's call, promising quick fixes and tangible results.  But the cost was steep, the danger of fragmenting the health system, of creating a maze of competing interests, each one a competing claimant for the meager resources.  The duplication of services, a wasteful thing, a bore in the earth of progress, the forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of drudgery.\n\nIn the end, the question remained, a haunting thing, a reminder of the fragility of life, and the impermanence of progress.  How to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness, how to save the lives of the young, and the mothers who would give them life?",
            "In the sweeping expanse of Victorian literature, two novels emerge as anomalies, their twisted threads refusing to be bound by the conventions of their era.  Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, like specters from a darker realm, haunt the traditions of the period, their somber silhouettes cast against the stern backdrop of the aristocracy. These novels veer from the expected, embracing the macabre and the unknown, as if driven by an otherworldly force. This aberration lends depth to their characters, imbuing them with an aura of mystery, inviting the reader to peer into the recesses of their troubled minds.\n\nThe darkness that lay within these characters seethed and churned, like a maelstrom on the horizon. And then, like a fleeting glimpse of the damned, the visage of Sikes and Crackit rose before him, their voices a maddening din that echoed through his mind. \"We were disputing,\" their words whispered, \"and he was caught in the midst of it, his thoughts tangled in the threads of their discord.\" The sound of firearms shattered the air, a cacophony of terror that tore him from the shadows, bearing him away on a tide of chaos. Pain seared his consciousness, a burning brand that scorched his every waking moment, its flames fueled by the anguish that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nIn these dark visions, the lines between reality and nightmare blurred, as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights danced on the precipice of madness. Oliver's inner turmoil unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads woven from the very fabric of his being. The shooting, a moment of unspeakable horror, replayed itself in his mind like a ghastly refrain, a litany of despair that haunted him still. His senses dulled, he was borne away on a tide of fear, his only solace the numbing ache that had become his constant companion. The question hung in the air, a taunting specter, whose cruel hand had brought about his misfortune. Was it his own fate, or the product of forces beyond his control? The answer, like the day itself, seemed to slip through his fingers like sand in the hourglass.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting moment of darkness, lost in the vast expanse of time. It was gone, consumed by the void, leaving only the weight of night, a heavy shroud that suffocated all in its grasp. The hours ticked by, each one a slow and labored breath, a countdown to the dawn that never came. And in this endless night, Oliver's spirit was crushed, his will broken by the weight of his despair, his heart a heavy stone, sunk deep in the darkness of his own private hell.",
            "The dust of recollection settles heavy upon the memories of my time spent in the after-school program, where I labored to instill the fundamentals of reading and English in the young minds of elementary age students. It was in this crucible that I encountered a boy named Adrian, a youth beset by an affliction that seemed at once both confounding and heartbreaking: he could speak English with perfect clarity, yet falter on the most basic aspects of reading. His struggles echoed within me, a dissonance that would not abate until I chanced upon his mother, a woman whose gaze was as foreign as the language she spoke - a language that hung in the air like an invisible veil, an impenetrable barrier that separated her from the world around her. It was in that moment, amidst the silence of unspoken comprehension, that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's troubles lay not in his ability to read, but in his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet, a fundamental building block of literacy that had been withheld from him.\n\nThis story I recount, a testament to the insidious nature of the language barrier that pervades our schools, particularly in a state like California, where the multiplicity of tongues and cultures seems to strain against the fabric of our collective understanding. It is a problem that seeks to confound us, to make us doubt our assumptions and our solutions. We are wont to think that language is a fixed entity, a clearly defined construct that can be learned and mastered with ease. But it is not so. For Adrian, the solution lay in the simplest of measures: a tutor's patient hand guiding him through the labyrinth of the alphabet, the gentle coaxing of sounds and meanings from the darkness. Yet for those children who are doubly bereft, those who speak little or no English, the answer is more complex, a Gordian knot that can only be unraveled through a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a program that seeks to nurture the bilingual minds of our children, is often met with skepticism and trepidation. We are told that it is a costly endeavor, that it will drain resources and yield little in return. But I would counter that this is a misconception, a false narrative that arises from a lack of understanding. The evidence suggests otherwise: children in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers academically. It is not a panacea, but a key that can unlock the doors of understanding for all our children, regardless of their linguistic heritage.\n\nSo how do we proceed? Do we demand that our teachers be bilingual? No, that would be a foolhardy expectation, one that would precipitate a crisis of proportions we cannot imagine. But we can - and must - provide the necessary tools to bridge the chasm of language. We can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever moniker we choose, who are fluent in multiple tongues. We can create an environment that values and celebrates the diversity of our children's language backgrounds, an environment that is as inclusive as it is supportive. In this way, we can begin to chip away at the obstacle of language, to create a future where every child has the opportunity to flourish, to read, to write, and to speak with confidence and precision.",
            "In the twilight of our earliest years, a presence looms, a force beyond our mortal grasp. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others tread the dusty paths of ancient temples, or probe the recesses of their own minds for answers. Many surrender to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, their conviction born of tradition and upbringing. Others, however, reject the edifice of dogma, scorning the notion of a transcendent realm beyond the confines of their own self-absorbed universe. We oscillate between disparate value systems, our spiritual compasses quivering like a compass needle in the void, as we strive to chart a course through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice a low, measured rumble, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless beat on the tin roof above. The gutters groaned, overflowing with the deluge, drowning the parched plants along the porch's edge. His eyes, sunken and haunted, seemed to stare into some distant realm, a mixture of searching and remembrance. Months of illness had leached the vitality from his frame, leaving him gaunt and spectral. His hair, once a rich mane, now hung sparse and lifeless. I felt a creeping dread, a sense of irreparable loss, as I watched him struggle to keep his gaze fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond us. I knew that speaking of it would only amplify the ache within us both, so I contented myself with a tentative touch, moving my chair closer to his, and joining him in his somber contemplation.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest of modern medicine, had prolonged his suffering, rendering him a shadow of his former self. What purpose did this serve, I wondered, as I lay alone in the dark, the silence a heavy shroud upon me. I did not pray, for if a God existed, I had long since abandoned any notion that He listened to my pleas. The thought was a cold comfort, a bleak acknowledgment of the abyss that yawned between us.\n\nI had not wished to witness his final passage, to behold the last flicker of life ebbing from his frame. I could not bear to watch the man who had given me life slip into the void. I wanted to recall him in all his vibrant, unbroken glory, not in the fragile, fading shell that now lay before me. Besides, I knew him better than any, better than his family, better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be a bystander to his departure, a mere spectator to the end of his journey. I curled into a fetal ball, wrapping myself in the shroud of my own grief, waiting for the news that would shatter me.\n\nThe silence was my only companion, a silence that wrapped itself around me like a shroud, unbroken and unbroken. No word came, no solace, no comfort. Only the stillness, and the darkness, and the crushing weight of my own despair.",
            "In a dissonant union of terms, the Gothic novel embodies the oxymoronic conjunction of the ancient and the modern, an incongruity that Ian Watt astutely observes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been derided and extolled, its profundity questioned and its capacity for evoking the 'terrible sublime' lauded by some (Burke). The earliest exemplar of the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the ancient romance and the modern novel to forge a new idiom, a synthesis of theater and nature. In this work, Walpole wove together the tattered threads of medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and tradition, creating a tapestry that would captivate and confound readers for generations to come. At the time of its publication, the term 'Gothic' was a polyvalent label, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was a term freighted with connotations of antiquity and unsophistication, an anachronism in the face of the modernity that was rapidly transforming the world.\n\nYet it was precisely this union of the archaic and the modern that allowed the Gothic novel to endure, its timelessness a testament to its capacity to transcend the boundaries of time and place. As the reader is transported to a world both familiar and strange, the novel's Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, its chivalric ideals and manners casting a long shadow over the present. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms serves as a poignant reminder of a bygone era, an era in which honor, bravery, and competence were the hallmarks of a true knight. This nostalgia for a vanished world was not merely a sentimental exercise, but a cri de coeur, a lament for the passing of a moral order that Walpole saw as being rapidly eroded in his own time.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's writing was a cry of despair, a lament for the loss of a world that seemed to be slipping away from him. His characters, including the enigmatic Frederic, embody the ideals of chivalry with a fervor that is both admirable and excessive. Frederic, a prince of unyielding virtue, has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and his very existence is a testament to the power of honor and courage in the face of adversity. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a man of unwavering commitment to his principles. And yet, this idealized figure is also a product of excess, a Gothic trope that would come to define the genre. In Frederic, we see the apotheosis of the gallant and courteous knight, a figure that would haunt the pages of the Gothic novel for generations to come.",
            "The labyrinthine threads of commerce weave together in an intricate dance, each strand a vital link in the unyielding chain that binds the customer to the raw material, and from thence to the product that satisfies their most primal needs. Supply chain management, a term coined by the sibylline Keith Oliver in 1982, is the unseen hand that governs this odyssey, a conjurer of efficiencies and a weaver of bespoke solutions. It is the master plan that orchestrates the symphony of production, supply, and distribution, a delicate ballet of movement and tempo.\n\nSix discrete elements comprise the nucleus of this grand endeavor: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, sturdy and unyielding, support the weight of the supply chain, providing a foundation upon which the edifice of customer satisfaction is built. The managers of commerce, wise and foresighted, employ these six elements to craft a narrative of service that is at once swift, efficient, and responsive to the whims of the market.\n\nProduction, the inaugural step in this grand procession, is the fertile soil in which the seeds of success are sown. It is here that the managers of industry must attune themselves to the rhythm of the market, listening to the whispers of the customer's demand, and responding with products that are at once relevant and desirable. The market, a capricious and mercurial force, holds sway over the production process, guiding the manager's hand as they chart the course of their endeavors.\n\nAs the manager navigates the treacherous waters of production, they must also consider the complexities of location, that most critical of variables. Where will the product be manufactured? At which plant will it be crafted, and with what degree of precision and quality? The manager must weigh the competing demands of volume and satisfaction, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable hunger for value and convenience.\n\nThe schedule of workloads and the maintenance of equipment are also crucial considerations, for in the realm of production, every detail is a thread in the intricate tapestry of commerce. A misstep, a miscalculation, can prove costly in the long run, a lesson learned by those who have walked the hallowed halls of retail, where the giants of commerce, Wal-Mart and Target, have honed their craft through the meticulous attention to detail and the relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this grand edifice, is the strategic art of discerning the core capabilities of a facility and forging alliances with partners who share a common vision. A manager must navigate the labyrinth of divisions, each with its unique strengths and specialties, and decide which path to follow, which partnerships to forge, and which opportunities to seize. And in this dance of supply, velocity is the holy grail, the elusive goal of providing quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness in equal measure.",
            "The faded words on the cardboard sign above Ellen's head seemed to bleed into the dusty street, a macabre message scrawled in Sharpie: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The stark phrase hung like a challenge in the sweltering air, a jarring reminder of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of this troubled land. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, had been ruled by the iron fist of a militant junta since the coup that seized power in 1962. The whispered rumors of a Saffron Revolution, born from the ash of public protests in 2007, spoke of a nation torn asunder by the monastic robes of its people, and the bloodlust of those who would seek to silence them.\n\nIt began with whispers, a gentle murmur of dissent that grew into a roar, as the monks, those revered guardians of the faith, took to the streets to demand justice. Foreign eyes, those of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, had witnessed the horrors of that conflict, and paid the ultimate price for his bravery. His death, like the countless others, was a testament to the unyielding resolve of those who sought to silence the voices of the people. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the very ranks of the junta, spoke of a toll that far exceeded the official count, a grim tally that spoke of a nation lost to madness and despair.\n\nBut this is a story that has been told before, in the dusty tomes of history, where the empires of old rose and fell, their leaders driven by a lust for power, a hunger that knew no bounds. The Romans, those gods-ordained rulers, had decreed their dominance over their people, while in Japan, the emperor was believed to be a deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of the divine. And in our own time, the echoes of a bygone era whispered through the halls of power, as a president, a man with a god-complex, held court with the leaders of a world that seemed to have lost its way.\n\nIn the annals of time, there are those who bear witness to the horrors of human nature: Tiananmen Square, where the ghosts of the dead still lingered, their numbers lost to the sands of time; the Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of innocents, driven by the primal urges of hate and fear; and the Third Reich, a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, where the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder by the madness of a single man. These are the echoes of a world in chaos, a world that seems to be forever lost in the darkness of its own making.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms large over the jazz landscape, his legacy an unyielding testament to the enduring power of creative vision. It is a testament forged in the crucible of time, tempered by the fires of innovation and the patient shaping of his orchestra. The piano, an instrument that could be as subtle as a summer breeze or as piercing as a winter storm, played its part in the compositions chosen for this exercise, but it was Ellington's genius as a composer that truly defined his art. He crafted frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl like a blooming flower, their individual petals of sound unfolding in a tapestry of rich and complex beauty. And yet, he was not averse to tightly coiled phrases, phrases that coiled around the essence of his players like a snake around its prey, coaxing forth the essence of their unique styles.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early masterpiece, stands as a testament to Ellington's willingness to experiment with the very fabric of sound. In this 12-bar blues, the human voice was elevated to an instrument of the highest order, its timbre weaving in and out of the reeds like a summer mist. The piece is a slow, deliberate dance, its six choruses unfolding like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice beginning smooth as silk, gradually roughening like the bark of a tree. The second chorus revolves around a muted trumpet, its solo a languid elaboration of the melody, replete with the sweet, mournful tones of the blue note.\n\nThe third chorus is a clarinet's lament, its sweeping phrases backed by a piano that trembles like a leaf in the autumn wind. The fourth chorus, a full-bodied echo of the first, sees the brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response, their voices entwined like the branches of a ancient tree. The fifth chorus is a climactic crescendo, the reeds now the initiators of the call, their voices soaring in the high register as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint. And in the final chorus, the voice assumes the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument, its sound a primal howl of joy and release.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a piece recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is on full display, his ear for tone color guiding the intricate dance of sound. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a masterclass in the marriage of vocal and instrumental elements, the two sounds blending together like the colors of a sunset on a summer's day. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington's use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, is a testament to his ability to coax the very best from his musicians, the muted trombone introducing the melody with a subtle, seductive elegance.",
            "The yearning had been a constant companion, a gnawing emptiness that refused to be sated. It had begun to take hold when she was a girl, a tender sprout of adolescence pushing its way up through the earth of her soul. Three years had passed, and the ache remained, a stubborn thorn that refused to be plucked. Her desire had shifted, from a thing to a person, yet the void within her remained unfulfilled. The faces of boys had crossed her path, each one a pale imitation of what she sought, and she had watched them with a detached curiosity, a stranger observing the antics of the oblivious.\n\nShe had questioned herself, pored over the mysteries of her own heart, seeking answers that remained elusive. Theories had been proposed, whispered in the darkness of her mind, but they were feeble attempts to grasp the ungraspable. She had lived, a cipher of uncertainty, suspended between the poles of longing and despair.\n\nBut this was not a day like any other. The house, a sanctuary of calm and tranquility, was rent asunder by the sound of her mother's cry. A scream, a raw and anguished cry, cut through the stillness like a knife. She ran, her feet pounding the floor, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and dread. The kitchen, a place of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos and distress.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face twisted in a grimace of pain, her voice a barely audible whisper. \"Ow...sweet...take me to the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a desperate plea that shook the daughter to her core. She rushed to her side, her hand reaching out to still the turmoil within her. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with concern. The answer was a hasty series of instructions, a directions to the car, and the daughter's resolve was set. She lifted her mother, her strength and resolve mingling with her worry and fear.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a bastion of sterility and suffering. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that clung to the skin. But she pushed it aside, her mind focused on the task at hand. She carried her mother, a fragile, broken thing, to the reception desk, her voice rising above the din of the waiting room. \"Help! My mother needs attention!\" The faces turned, a blur of concern and compassion, and a wheelchair was produced, a makeshift cradle for her mother's broken body.\n\nThe doctors came, their faces a blur of efficiency and expertise, and her mother was whisked away, a fragile leaf on the wind. She was left to wait, a sentinel of worry, her heart heavy with the weight of her mother's pain. The fall from the stool, a seemingly minor incident, had left her mother broken and battered. The stillness of the house had given way to chaos and confusion, and she was left to pick up the pieces, to try and make sense of the shattered world around her.",
            "The dim lights of a distant world cast long shadows across the expanse of our understanding, yet the promise of the Mediterranean Diet beckons us forward like a siren's call.  Its adherents, a verdant host, feast upon the bounty of plant life - fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - their tables spread with the trappings of a healthier existence.  They eschew the darkness of saturated fats, instead welcoming the golden glow of monounsaturated oils into their lives.  And in this quiet reverence for the land, they find solace in the gentle warmth of moderate alcohol, a reminder that even in excess, there is a fine line between indulgence and moderation.\n\nThe whispers of prior studies have long whispered of the Med Diet's protective benefits - a shield against the ravages of total and cardiovascular mortality, a gentle breeze that rustles the leaves of weight loss and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.  Yet, a void had existed in our knowledge, a chasm that yawned wide and deep, unexplored and uncharted, where the mysteries of stroke and stroke mortality dwelled.  It is in this void that our study ventures forth, a lone traveler in the wilderness of data, seeking to illuminate the paths that lead to a healthier existence.\n\nOur journey began with 74,886 women, a sisterhood bound together by the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses in 11 states.  Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, we computed the aMed diet score, a metric that sang the praises of their nutrient intake, their tables spread with the bounty of their self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\"  And though the years went by, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, more than 95% of these women remained steadfast, their participation a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance.\n\nTheir reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records, hospital documents, and death certificates.  And where the records were scarce, we relied on the whispered rumors of probable cases, a shadowy realm where 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts dwelled.  We also calculated the body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, a litany of factors that sought to confuse and mislead us.  But we stood firm, our gaze fixed on the horizon, as we adjusted for these confounders, our steps steady and resolute.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical cartographer, charted the course of our inquiry, its terrain marked by the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  And in the end, our findings emerged like a dawn breaking over the horizon - the women who adhered to the Mediterranean Diet, their aMed diet score a beacon of hope, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke, their relative risk a mere 0.71, a testament to the power of a diet that honors the land and the body.",
            "The darkness crept in like a thief in the night, stealing the very foundations of a nation's prosperity. It began in 2007, a year when the behemoths of American finance teetered on the precipice of collapse. Unemployment stalked the land like a specter, the housing market lay in shambles, and the once-mighty corporations, those titans of industry, were reduced to mere shadows of their former selves. And so, we are left to ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how might we prevent its recurrence? The answer lies in the hubris of those who would guide the ship of state, their decisions driven by a reckless abandon that would have far-reaching consequences. They goaded the banks and financial institutions to peddle sub-prime loans to the unwary, to those who could ill afford them, into an economic landscape as fragile as a house of cards.\n\nThe machinery of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, was coerced into buying and repackaging these toxic assets, creating a Frankenstein's monster of a financial system. And when the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, their reserves drained by the very chaos they had unleashed. The contagion spread, a cancer that would not be contained, infecting the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in 1999, a year of promise and hubris. The Clinton administration, driven by a lust for power and a desire to enhance their popularity, chose to ease lending restrictions, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, penned a prescient warning in the pages of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" His words, a clarion call to beware, fell on deaf ears, and the consequences of their actions would be dire indeed. \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s,\" he wrote, a prediction that would prove all too accurate.\n\nThe economic landscape was transformed by the proliferation of new and complex financial instruments, a veritable Tower of Babel that would eventually collapse under its own weight. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were the instruments of choice, weaving a web of debt that would ensnare the very fabric of the economy. The U.S. households and financial markets, drunk on the sweet nectar of easy credit, overextended themselves, leaving them vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the market. And when the housing bubble burst, the consequences were catastrophic. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that would haunt the nation for generations to come. Bear, Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to a regimen of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their coffers overflowing with mortgage debt, were placed under government control, a testament to the hubris of those who had brought about their downfall.",
            "The stagnant air of exposition clings to the writer's words like the dry dust of a forgotten land.  It is the place where the narrative's wings beat listlessly, a monotone drone that threatens to lull the reader into a state of torpor, their eyes glazing over like the surface of a stagnant pool.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her face a mask of frustration as she wrestles with the siren's song of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition, that seductive fiend, whispers sweet nothings in the writer's ear, urging them to dispense with the tedious details, to hasten the pace and reach the meat of the story.  But it is a deceitful guide, one that promises a quick escape from the tedium of character development, of atmosphere, of the slow unfolding of the narrative's tapestry.\n\nThe cardinal sin of exposition is to tell, rather than to show.  To dump the reader's lap with a veritable feast of facts and figures, leaving them to sort through the morass like a lost traveler in a desert.  In the cinema, it is the awkward exchange, the clunky exposition dump, where one character unloads their entire life story upon another, a cliche-ridden monologue that would put even the most patient viewer to sleep.  In fiction, it is the author's own telling hand that wields the pen of exposition, carving out great chunks of narrative with all the finesse of a hatchet.\n\nConsider, for instance, a heroine whose life has been forever altered by the presence of a man.  We are told of their meeting, of their marriage, of his brutal and senseless murder.  But what of the man himself?  What of the love they shared, the laughter, the tears, the whispered promises in the dead of night?  To reduce their history to a mere paragraph, a cold recitation of facts, is to deny the reader the chance to feel the weight of his loss, to mourn his passing alongside the heroine.  It is to leave their emotions as dry and barren as the page itself.\n\nA writer's task, then, is to breathe life into the bones of the narrative.  To flesh out the characters, to infuse them with the subtle nuances of speech and action, to allow the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their souls.  It is a labor of love, a slow and painstaking craft that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to let the story unfold at its own pace.  For in the end, it is not the telling that matters, but the showing.  The meat of the story, not the bare bones.  The reader's participation, not their tolerance.\n\nAnd so, the writer's hand hovers over the keyboard, poised to strike, ready to begin.  But the temptation to rush, to dispense with the tedious details, is ever-present, a siren's call that beckons them down a path of least resistance.  To indulge, and risk losing the reader in a sea of exposition, or to resist, and risk crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and alive.  The choice, as ever, is theirs alone.",
            "I watched the newscast from Columbus, Ohio, a city shrouded in the hush of morning's early light. The NBC 4 broadcast, carried on the thirteenth of August in the year of our reckoning, 2011, unfolded like a tapestry of violence and despair. The lead story, a disquieting tale of domestic carnage, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a grim rictus, his eyes vacant as a doll's. They showed his mug shot, a fleeting glimpse into the abyss that had driven him to stab his wife, her name left unspoken, a forgotten cipher. The report was brief, a mere two minutes of airtime, as if the gravity of the act was too much to bear, a weight that threatened to consume the very fabric of the broadcast.\n\nThe next story, a somber account of a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed to be devoured by the very shadows that shrouded it. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old youth, lay critically injured, his fate hanging in the balance, a threadbare thread of hope suspended between life and death. The SWAT team moved in, a dark and impersonal force, their presence a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner. I couldn't help but wonder if the news would have given the same attention to a similar tale if the victim had been a different hue, if the neighborhood had been a different shade of skin.\n\nThe news continued, a litany of violence and disregard, a litany of lives lost or forever changed. A gunshot hole marred the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder of the randomness of violence, the ease with which it can strike. A .22 caliber bullet, fired from a rifle, had pierced the metal, leaving a trail of uncertainty in its wake. A five-thousand-dollar reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture, a fleeting promise of justice in a world that often seemed devoid of it.\n\nThe forecast, a brief interlude of tranquility, spoke of rain and thunderstorms to come, a respite from the darkness that had plagued the city. The temperatures, a mere afterthought, would hover in the mid to low eighties, a trivial concern in the face of the violence that had consumed the airwaves.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, unfolded like a tired trop, a narrative of a dark-skinned black man, his features reduced to a mere caricature. He wore a hoodie, a symbol of anonymity, a cloak of invisibility. His height, a mere 6 feet tall, his weight, a paltry 150 pounds, seemed almost laughable, a grotesque parody of humanity. The news anchor's voice dripped with an almost cruel emphasis, as if the man's color was the only thing that mattered.\n\nAnd then, like a whisper in the wind, a mention of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, his fate sealed in a 300-month sentence, a number that seemed to hold a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain gravity that the news anchor sought to convey. But what did it matter, really? Was it the length of the sentence, or the fact that he was a Hispanic man, a label that seemed to serve no purpose in the story? The news, a reflection of our collective soul, a soul that seems to shrug at the violence, the injustice, the disregard for life.",
            "In the vast and unforgiving expanse of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unrelenting. Like a tempest, it sweeps through the souls of two men, leaving in its wake a tempest of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – a maelstrom of fervor that defies the tender mercies of reason. It is here, in the crucible of adversity, that the true mettle of this bond is tried, and the depths of their characters are laid bare. The cost of this union is a heavy one, a burden that must be shouldered by those who would walk this path. To gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, unvarnished and unflinching – a mirror held up to the darkness that lies within.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark upon a journey through a lush, verdant landscape, their footsteps echoing through the stillness like the beat of a funeral drum. The air is thick with the weight of their emotions, as bitter disappointment struggles against the intense pride that threatens to consume them both. It is here, in this fevered moment, that the true nature of their bond is revealed, a tangled web of love and resentment that ultimately proves fatal for one of them. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are given a glimpse into the twisted world of the protagonist, a world in which the lines between good and evil are blurred, and the consequences of one's actions are writ large upon the landscape.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of pride, a monolith of emotion that towers over his every waking moment. From the outset, he is driven by a sense of disappointment, a sense that his brother Doodle, crippled by a weak heart, is a constant reminder of all that he has lost. He had dreamed of a brother who could keep pace with him, a companion in the untamed wilderness of their youth. But Doodle's frailty shatters these dreams, leaving the protagonist to grapple with the darkness that lies within. His heart seethes with anger and resentment, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to boil over at any moment. And yet, it is in these moments of fury that we catch glimpses of a deeper love, a love that is both beautiful and terrible in its intensity. The protagonist's thoughts turn to the unthinkable – to suffocating the small child with a pillow – and yet, it is the simple, unguarded smile of his brother that stays his hand, a reminder of the love that lies at the heart of their bond. It is a love that flickers like a candle in the darkness, a fragile flame that threatens to be extinguished by the very emotions that seek to consume it.",
            "The mind is a labyrinthine repository of unfathomable complexity, a vast and dark expanse of neural concatenation. As the epochs pass, so too do the metaphors that have been used to describe it, each one a faint echo of the truth, a fleeting glimpse of the abyss that lies within. From the wax tablet of ancient lore to the papyrus scroll of forgotten knowledge, and from the book of dusty tomes to the cold, calculating machine, the mind has been likened to each in turn. And yet, it is a mistake to cling too tightly to these comparisons, for they are but feeble approximations of the uncharted depths that lie within.\n\nThe process begins with the influx of sensory stimuli, a barrage of raw data that assails the senses like a tempest: the tactile thrum of touch, the fiery kiss of heat, the sonic boom of sound waves, the radiant flash of light. These primal sensations are transformed, transmuted, and reconstituted by the alchemy of the brain, a process of bottom-up and top-down sorcery that weaves the disparate threads of perception into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nThe example of the black box on a white background is a case in point: the bottom-up process, a concatenation of simple, brutish facts – color, orientation, borders – that coalesce into a nascent understanding of the object before us. And yet, it is the top-down process that imbues this nascent understanding with context and significance, that elevates the mere thing to a box, a container of meaning that holds within it the power to persuade and to inform.\n\nAnd yet, even as the mind processes this information, a filter of attention holds sway, a gatekeeper that determines what is worthy of consideration and what is cast aside. The healthy mind is a filter that discriminates, that separates the signal from the noise, the wheat from the chaff. We notice the name, the loved one, the thing that speaks to us on a deep and primal level, even in the midst of cacophony and confusion.\n\nThe storage of information is a further mystery, a process of encoding and maintaining that is still poorly understood. Sensory memory, working memory, long-term memory – each is a distinct and separate realm, a kingdom unto itself. The encoding of information is a process of translation, a conversion of the raw data of the senses into a language that the mind can understand. And the maintenance of this information, the preservation of the encoded signal, is a task of great delicacy, a balancing act between the competing claims of retention and forgetting.\n\nThe models of the mind, the theories of how knowledge is organized within its labyrinthine recesses, are many and varied. Some are based on the way we remember, on the threads of association that connect one idea to another. Others are based on the cold, calculating logic of computer science, on the algorithms that govern the flow of information. And others still are rooted in the dark, mysterious world of neurophysiology, where the secrets of the mind are slowly beginning to yield to the prodding of science.\n\nBut even as we strive to understand the mind, to comprehend the intricacies of its workings, we must never forget that we are but strangers in a strange land, that the truth lies just beyond our grasp, waiting to be seized by the bold and the curious.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley summons the specter of a dystopian future, where the fetid tendrils of technology and the suffocating grip of capitalism entwine to strangle the last vestiges of humanity. The inhabitants of this bleak realm, conditioned from the earliest stages of their existence to crave fleeting pleasures above all else, stumble through lives devoid of purpose, their existence a hollow mockery of true human experience. The World Controller, an unseen puppeteer, orchestrates this farce, manipulating the strings of a society that values conformity above all else.\n\nAs one peers into the abyss of Huxley's creation through the lens of Marxist theory, the author's seething disdain for the emerging economic order of his time becomes apparent. The Marxist lexicon of homogeny and reification peppers the narrative, serving as a scathing indictment of the insidious forces that seek to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction. The concept of false consciousness, that most pernicious of Marxist theses, is aptly illustrated in the conditioned masses, who are duped into believing that their interests are inextricably linked to the perpetuation of the status quo. The Delta, Gamma, and other subaltern classes, their wills reduced to mere automatons, are ensnared in a web of ideological control, their every whim manipulated by the insidious whispers of the World Controller.\n\nThe hegemony of the upper classes, that most insidious of social hierarchies, is starkly illuminated in Brave New World. The Alphas and Betas, born with the privilege of awareness, yet blinded by their own complicity, acquiesce to the dictates of the World Controller, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of oppression. The relationships between individuals in this dystopia are reduced to a shallow farce, a vacuous exercise in superficiality, devoid of true connection or depth. The interactions between the characters, a jarring cacophony of shallow observations and hollow sentiments, serve only to highlight the sterility of a society that has abandoned the very concept of human emotion.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, love is a distant memory, replaced by a crass and utilitarian calculus, where individuals are reduced to mere commodities, valued only for their utility. The comments of the males, a tiresome litany of objectification, serve as a stark reminder of the ways in which the gaze of the powerful insidiously reduces the subject to a mere object, devoid of agency or autonomy. The females, their voices a monotone recitation of shallow desires, serve only to reinforce the notion that in this desolate future, humanity has lost all capacity for genuine expression.\n\nThe complacency of the social classes, their willing acquiescence to their station in life, serves as a damning indictment of the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience to the dictates of the World Controller, a testament to the insidious power of ideological control, serves as a chilling reminder of the ways in which the proletariat can be duped into believing that their own superiority is contingent upon their continued compliance. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a dystopian future, a nightmarish reflection of our own, where the insidious forces of technology and capitalism have reduced humanity to a mere husk, a hollow shell of what once was.",
            "I have traversed the grounds of University Park for nigh on three years now, the passage of time marked by changing seasons and the shifting landscape of a campus in constant flux. For many, the endeavor of navigating this sprawling expanse has proven a daunting task. In my first year, I was consigned to an East Halls dorm, situated far to the eastern extremity of campus, save for the imposing bulk of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the Willard building, situated near the heart of the campus, could stretch on for a quarter of an hour, nay, even more, should the weather conspire against me, as it often does in this benighted corner of the state.\n\nIn conversation with an alumnus not much my senior, I chanced upon a tale of a bygone era, when the East Halls dorms stood isolated from the rest of the university, surrounded by vast tracts of unused land. Now, those vacant expanses have given way to fields of green, grand edifices, and the creeping tendrils of apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly entwined with the challenge of traversing this ever-growing landscape. Among the solutions to this conundrum, one stands paramount: the humble bicycle. Yet, the bike itself is but a mere tool, a mere catalyst. Students must be willing to wield it, and the campus must be designed with the needs of these two-wheeled travelers in mind.\n\nA friend, recently resurgent in his love of cycling after a period of inactivity, shared with me his epiphany. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to truly move.\" And he was not alone in his sentiments. For in a world where the passage of time is a currency we can ill afford to squander, bicycling offers a most economical means of locomotion. A simple breakfast, a gentle exertion, and the miles melt away like morning dew. I, too, have discovered the joys of pedal power, having chosen to inhabit a domicile off campus, situated at a remove from the heart of the university. My daily peregrinations to the Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep, are reduced to a mere five minutes, should I choose to pedal with a modicum of haste. Alas, the road to my destination, Pollock Road, is not always a gentle one, and the obstacles that lie in wait for the unwary cyclist are many.\n\nYet, I find myself drawn to the bicycle's sweet allure, for walking, though a noble pursuit, is a luxury I can ill afford. Were I to eschew my trusty steed, the sole alternative would be to trudge, to plod through the streets, devoting a full half-hour to an hour of my day to the tedium of foot travel. And that, multiplied by the number of classes, appointments, and other obligations, would consume a good portion of my waking hours, leaving me with little time for the pursuits that truly nourish my soul."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of a world beset on all sides by the ravages of human suffering, I find myself drawn to the path of social work. A career within the Division of Family and Children Services beckons, a siren's call to those who would seek to heal the wounds of the broken and the battered. It is a calling that speaks to the deepest recesses of my being, a summons to take up the mantle of compassion and to wield it against the cruel indifference of a world that often seems more concerned with the smooth operation of its own machinery than the well-being of its most vulnerable members. \n\nThe values that guide me on this journey are not those of a stranger, but of a pilgrim who has walked the hard roads of this world and has seen the ravages of its cruelty. Service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships between individuals - these are the bedrock upon which I stand. And I am driven by a fierce determination to hone my craft, to sharpen my skills and to remain steadfast in the face of the unrelenting tide of human suffering.\n\nI have always been drawn to the plight of others, and it was only a matter of time before I found myself on this path. The years spent in high school and college were a crucible, a testing ground where I saw the fractures in the social fabric of our society laid bare. I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their faces a mask of denial, while others searched for solace in fleeting escapes. It was then that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a caregiver and to wield it against the forces of despair.\n\nMy journey to this point has not been an easy one. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I felt adrift, unsure of the path that lay ahead. But it was on that summer, in the sterile quiet of a friend's living room, that I encountered a young boy, his eyes a window to a soul battered and bruised by the cruel hand of circumstance. His story is one that has stayed with me to this day, a burning ember of conscience that fuels my determination to act. I drove to his parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding, and there I found myself face to face with the abyss of human cruelty. The parents, their faces a mask of feigned concern, their words a tissue of lies and half-truths, tried to shift the blame onto their son, to portray him as a manipulative child who had brought this suffering upon himself. But I saw the truth, a truth that has stayed with me to this day: that the true monsters are not the children, but the adults who fail to protect and nurture them.\n\nAnd so I began to walk the path of social work, driven by a fierce determination to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Another value that guides me is social justice, a concept that is often trotted out as a catchphrase, but which I believe in with every fiber of my being. I have always been an outsider, a rebel who refuses to conform to the norms of a society that values sameness over individuality. I have fought against the tide of oppression, whether it was the stifling conformity of high school or the entrenched racism and homophobia of our society. I have worn my hair in unnatural colors, pierced my ears, and declared my solidarity with those who are different from me. And I will continue to do so, for I believe that it is only by challenging the status quo that we can create a more just and equitable world.",
            "The darkness of insomnia, a shroud that wraps itself around the waking mind, has long been a subject of study. The twin prongs of the biological and sociocultural models offer two disparate yet intertwined perspectives on this affliction. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving calculus, reduces the complexity of sleep to the binary terms of genetic predisposition and physiological imperfection. The hypothalamus, a glandular outpost in the depths of the brain, governs the delicate balance between wakefulness and slumber, its neurons a symphony of firings and silences. The orexin neurons, those errant violinists, dance with the GABAB receptors, their harmonies a lullaby of sleep, or a cacophony of wakefulness. The study of mice, a proxy for humanity, reveals a truth both banal and profound: the activation of the GABAB receptor induces a sleep that is both a respite and a surrender. The inhibition of this receptor, a quietus, brings a stillness that is both restorative and oppressive. The GABAB agonist, a pharmacological siren, lures the sleeper into a realm of repose, a realm from which the waking world is distant and indistinct.\n\nBut the sociocultural model, a lens that refracts the prism of experience, reveals a more nuanced truth. The inheritance of the phenotypic GABAB receptor, a genetic legacy, shapes the contours of our sleep, a topography of the self. The alterations to this receptor, a subtle yet decisive tweak, can unravel the fabric of our waking lives, leaving in its wake a trail of fragmented thoughts and behaviors. The implications are stark: a life lived in the shadow of insomnia, a life of fragmented days and sleepless nights, a life of halting steps and uncertain purpose.\n\nIn the darkness of the night, the insomnia-ridden mind wanders, lost and forlorn, a pilgrim without a map. The biological and sociocultural models, two competing cartographers, chart the terrain of this affliction, their maps a testament to the complexities of the human condition. But the truth, like the night itself, remains elusive, a will-o-the-wisp that beckons and escapes.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a quiet affliction, a disorder of the auditory realm that defies the senses and eludes the understanding. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition shrouded in the shadows of perception, lies at the heart of the enigma. It is a malady wherein the central nervous system, that labyrinthine network of neurons and synapses, falters in its duty to transcribe the whispers of the world into meaningful sound. The afflicted, though their ears may be intact, find themselves lost in a cacophony of confusion, their brains struggling to untangle the skein of noise that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder's existence date back to the 1950s, when the winds of research began to stir in the realm of communicative disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like beacons in the darkness, lit the path forward with their tests and trials, seeking to grasp the elusive nature of this condition. The work of Kimura, who introduced the concept of dichotic testing in 1961, illuminated the pathways of the auditory cortex, shedding light upon the mysteries of perception. And yet, despite these advances, the disorder remained shrouded, its true face hidden behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the shadows that dance upon a wall. The sufferer may find themselves lost in the expanse of sound, unable to pinpoint the source of a noise, or to distinguish between two or more competing auditory events. They may struggle to recognize patterns, to decipher the hidden rhythms that govern the world. The subtleties of speech, the nuances of tone and inflection, may be lost upon them, leaving them bereft of understanding. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, a cacophony of chaos that threatens to consume all. And in the midst of this maelstrom, the sufferer may find themselves unable to synthesize the disparate threads of sound into a meaningful whole, or to unravel the sequence of auditory clues that govern the world.\n\nThe diagnosis of this disorder is a labyrinthine process, a journey through the twisting corridors of perception. The patient is subjected to a battery of tests, a series of trials designed to probe the depths of their auditory faculties. The audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists, like guides in a wilderness, navigate the patient through a maze of questionnaires and surveys, observation and experimentation. But even as they strive to grasp the essence of the disorder, they are confronted with the truth that there is no single, definitive test, no one tool that can unlock the secrets of the afflicted brain. The causes of the disorder remain a mystery, a whispered rumor in the darkness.",
            "In the depths of twelfth night's hush, where moonlight weaves an inconstant veil, Twelfth Night's whispered truths unfold like a tattered tapestry. A deceiver's guile, it seems, is a double-edged sword, capable of piercing the heart with a thousand cuts of sorrow. The outward guise, though a temporary reprieve, can soon become a shroud that suffocates the soul. To shed the disguise, to reveal the truth, is to risk being forsaken by those who once called you kin. And so, the choice is laid bare: to preserve the self, or to preserve the relationships that bind us to the fragile, faltering world.\n\nIn the realm of Twelfth Night, the dance of deception is a waltz of twisted desires, where the lines between truth and falsehood blur like the shifting sands of a desert dune. Viola, a maiden lost in a strange land, dons the cloak of masculinity to shield herself from the ravages of a hostile world. Her ruse, a clever contrivance, proves effective in its purpose, yet it exacts a terrible price: she is estranged from the very women who would have been her succor, her support in a world gone mad. The sea of Olivia's affections, once set upon the shore of Cesario's masculine form, now shifts to the rocky shores of Sebastian's fraternal presence. The tides of desire, it seems, are as changeable as the wind.\n\nAnd yet, in this maelstrom of deception, a glimmer of insight emerges. The masks we wear, the guises we assume, may be the catalyst for the unveiling of secrets long suppressed, hidden deep within the recesses of the heart. Olivia's ardor for Cesario, a flame that burns bright and fierce, may be but a reflection of a deeper longing, a yearning that dare not speak its name. Or is it a jest, a cruel mockery of the societal norms that bind us to the strictures of expectation? The ambiguity lingers, a shadow cast upon the page, a testament to the complexities of the human heart.\n\nIn Twelfth Night, Shakespeare weaves a tapestry of paradox and intrigue, a dance of deception that leads us down a path of discovery, where the masks we wear are but a fragile barrier between the self and the unknown.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of German colonial rule, a bleak tapestry of brutality was woven, most starkly evident in the genocide that ravaged the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Yet, to speak of such atrocities as the sum total of an empire's cruelty would be a gross oversimplification. The German colonial project, a hydra-headed beast, exhibited a maddening diversity in its policies and ruling style, a labyrinthine complexity that defied reduction to a single description. Educational provision, a paltry lifeline cast to the colonized, was similarly variegated, a patchwork quilt of disparate threads that mirrored the fractured geography of the colonies.\n\nWhen the British assumed dominion over German East Africa, a land that would come to be known as Tanganyika, they found a population of Africans beset by the light of knowledge, their minds awakened to the whispers of literacy. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors had earned the praise of contemporary chroniclers. Yet, in South West Africa, a stark contrast emerged, a harsh dichotomy that would leave an indelible mark on the land. Unlike the East African colonies, where the government had taken a firm hand in the education of the native populations, in South West Africa, the task of enlightening the untutored masses was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the stingy support of a government more concerned with the education of its own kind. State schools for Europeans sprouted like weeds, their foundations laid upon the fertile soil of colonial largesse, while the native populations were left to wither, unlettered and unenlightened.\n\nThe legacy of these educational policies lingered, a ghostly presence that haunted the land long after the German colonial project had been extinguished. In South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, a stark testament to the cruel hand of colonial fortune. The reasons for this divergence were multifaceted, a Gordian knot of social, political, and economic factors that had ensnared the colony in its grasp. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled threads of this narrative, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the new research that has shed light upon this oft-overlooked chapter in the annals of colonial history.\n\nA vast literature has grown up around the topic of education in the German colonial empire, a sprawling jungle of sources that threaten to overwhelm the unwary scholar. The earliest works, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with describing the contours of educational systems in the various colonies. Later writings, penned in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, undertaking comparative studies of education in the German colonies and subjecting the specific aspects of education to close analysis. These studies revealed a tapestry of differences, a rich and varied brocade that defied reduction to a single narrative. Cohen's magnum opus, a study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a towering monolith in this literature, its influence still felt today. Cohen's research, a probing examination of the educational systems of the two colonies, shed light upon the factors that accounted for their divergent paths.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, presented a colonial authority with a choice: to cultivate the arid desert that stretched across the territory, to coax forth the hidden riches that lay beneath the surface, or to succumb to the harsh beauty of the landscape. The European population, a hardy and resilient people, chose the latter path, drawn by the lure of a relatively temperate climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that swelled the ranks of the settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony, by nearly threefold. The stage was set for a drama of colonial proportions, one that would play out in the deserts and savannas of South West Africa, a drama that would be written in the blood of the native populations and the steel of the colonial project.",
            "In the crepuscular expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, labyrinthine forest, its classifications as elusive as the whispers of the wind. Genres have sprouted like weeds, their tendrils snaking into the earth, giving birth to a proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that defy mortal comprehension. Amidst this tangled thicket, Heavy Metal stands as a behemoth, its dark, Gothic limbs stretching towards the sky like a twisted, cadaverous tree. It is a genre of unbridled expression, a canvas of sound that paints the shadows on the wall of the human experience.\n\nIn the past four decades, the Metal movement has unfurled its dark, sinuous tendrils, embracing a kaleidoscope of emotions, yet fixated on the bleaker reaches of the emotional spectrum. Its offspring, a multitude of sub-genres, have burst forth like a riotous bloom, each one a unique, dark flower. The Metal movement, a churning, amorphous mass, has devoured and assimilated influences from other genres, yet its essence remains a mystery, a maelstrom of sound that defies categorization.\n\nTo grasp the Metal music that surrounds us, one must first confront the void that lies at its core. Metal is a music of excess, a defiant rejection of the bland, the mundane. It is a sound that conjures forth the primordial fears and desires that slumber beneath the surface of human consciousness. The virtuosos of Metal, masters of their craft, wield their instruments like serrated blades, slicing through the veil of reality to reveal the abyss that lies within.\n\nThe darkness that permeates Metal is not merely a metaphor; it is a lived experience, a vortex of emotions that draws the listener in, like a moth to the flame. The psychedelic excesses of the 1970s, a maelstrom of experimentation and creativity, birthed a generation of musicians who plumbed the depths of the human psyche, creating music that was at once beautiful and terrifying. The Romantic Era, with its emphasis on the sublime and the grotesque, left an indelible mark on the Metal movement, its influence still felt today.\n\nThe lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that some claim to be one of the first Heavy Metal anthems, distill the darkness that lies at the heart of the movement. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the darker side of rock, it is a declaration of sonic rebellion, a defiant cry into the void. The Beatles, those masters of melodic craft, had created a sound that was at once innovative and unsettling, a sound that would influence generations to come.",
            "The Dream, a painting born of Henri Rousseau's ardent longing, lay in the crucible of his own tortured soul. Conceived in 1910, it was a moment of fleeting insight, a flash of lucidity amidst the unyielding din of his own creative torment. In this work, the artist, a man beset by the abyss of self-doubt, laid bare his own inner struggle - a Sisyphean quest for acceptance, for validation in a world that seemed determined to silence him.\n\nIt was a struggle born of circumstance, of the jagged topography of his own life. A tinsmith's son, raised in the provinces of northwest France, Rousseau's early years were marked by the dull, unyielding routine of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a man of little renown. The name he chose for himself, the douanier, a customs inspector, was a cruel mockery, a mocking reminder of his own pedestrian existence. His first wife, Clémence, died, taking with her eight infant children, leaving Rousseau to navigate the desolate landscape of grief, his only solace the fragile thread of a daughter, Julia.\n\nIt was in this desolate expanse that he found his solace in painting, a refuge from the crushing weight of his own insignificance. And yet, even as he poured his heart and soul into his work, he was driven by a hunger for recognition, for the approbation of the art world he so desperately sought to join. The Surrealists, those mad visionaries, were painting their own dreamscapes, their own private kingdoms of the mind, but Rousseau's Dream was something different, a desperate bid for acceptance, a plea for entry into a world that seemed determined to exclude him.\n\nFor years, he toiled in obscurity, his work unknown to the world beyond his humble circle. It was only when Matisse, that great master of modern art, began to make his mark, that Rousseau's own work began to gain recognition. And yet, even in his success, Rousseau remained haunted by the specter of his own inadequacy, a man forever trapped in the labyrinth of his own self-doubt. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's desire was not to create something new, something bold, but rather to paint a picture so conventional, so acceptably bourgeois, that he might finally be admitted to the rarefied ranks of the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream, that enigmatic painting, is a testament to this struggle, a cri de coeur from the depths of Rousseau's own tortured psyche. It is a painting of a woman, lost in a world of wonder, but also a painting of the artist himself, lost in a world of his own making, forever torn between the twin abysses of conformity and creative freedom.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human understanding, a faint tremor runs through the fabric of thought. It is the whispered conversation between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. A murmur that echoes through the corridors of the mind, a siren's call to the unseen. For in the words of John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a bald assertion, a cry from the wilderness, a statement that defies the sterile light of reason.\n\nWe think we grasp ethics and aesthetics through the dusty tomes of learning or the worn pathways of experience. But no, they are not so easily captured. They are the will-o'-the-wisps that dance at the edge of perception, always receding into the shadows as we approach. As Keats so eloquently put it, both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe, not to prescribe. We seek to explain the why of a work of art, the why of a moral act, but the words falter on our lips like autumn leaves.\n\nCriticism, that most vaunted of endeavors, can never fully grasp the essence of what is good or beautiful. The critics' words, like the scratchings on a cave wall, are feeble attempts to corral the uncontainable. Consider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile that has beguiled the ages. Do we speak of her fame in terms of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context? No, we do not. We speak of something more, something that defies articulation. A phrase like \"There's just something about it\" trembles on the lips, a confession of the inadequacy of language.\n\nAnd so it is with ethics. Flannery O'Connor's words, like a desert wind, blow through our understanding: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics, like art, transcends the bounds of description. It speaks to something deeper, something that cannot be captured by the words of the wise or the learned. As Wittgenstein so starkly put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this very transcendence, this je ne sais quoi, that binds ethics and aesthetics together in a bond of shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a level that is both intimate and ineffable. It is a noumenal realm, a world beyond the reach of words. As Kant so astutely observed, it is a realm that is felt, not thought. And it is here, in this hidden place, that we find the connection between ethics and aesthetics. For it is in the art of literature that we find this connection most clearly. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" It is a quality that speaks to the very heart of our humanity, a quality that is both beautiful and true.",
            "The shadows of the Alps cast a somber hue upon the Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of disparate cultures. From the mist-shrouded spires of München to the Baltic's unforgiving shores in Kiel, a singular unity holds sway, a testament to the indomitable will of a people born of the land. The Rhine's dark waters course through the heart of Köln, a city veiled in mystery, while Dresden, a Saxon stronghold, stands sentinel on the Elbe, its stone façades bearing the weight of a storied past. It is little wonder, then, that the culture of this land is a tapestry rich with the threads of countless influences, a testament to the primordial forces that shaped the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe origins of the name Germania are shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty, a labyrinth of conflicting theories and half-truths. Tacitus, that knowing chronicler of the Empire's darkest hours, posited that the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that had crossed the Rhine, their hearts afire with a warrior's passion. Others claimed that Julius Caesar, that master of the Gallic Wars, coined the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls' own tongue, a distinction between the subjugated and the unconquered. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a chilling testament to the unyielding ferocity of the Germanic tribes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe Old English Dictionary whispers another tale, one of a spear, a ger, wielded by warriors in the heat of battle, while the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" suggests a people unafraid to make their presence known. And yet, it is Tacitus who provides the most trenchant insight into the Germanic soul, his De Origine et situ Germanorum a searing indictment of the unforgiving landscape: \"I should regard them as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans, those masters of conquest, gazed upon Germania with a mixture of disdain and fascination, their legions probing the borders of this unforgiving land, their spoils a testament to the Germanic tribes' unyielding ferocity. And so, the Germanic tribes, a motley assemblage of warriors and traders, lived on the fringes of the Empire, their skills honed in the crucible of battle, their goods exchanged for the fleeting promise of Roman wealth. (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17)",
            "The vista before me lay shrouded in a dull haze.  My mind, a vacant slate, refused to inscribe meaning upon the scene that unfolded before my eyes.  The image, a jumble of disparate parts, held an illusory coherence, its constituent elements existing in a state of suspended animation, bereft of significance.  Thoughts arose, flitted, and then vanished, their ephemeral nature as fleeting as the wisp of smoke on the wind.\n\nIt was in a moment of fleeting curiosity that I had chanced upon \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist I had worked with had recommended it, and I, driven by a long-held aspiration to grasp the mysteries of line and form, had purchased the book.  The words within its pages spoke of a world where the pencil was not merely a tool, but a key to unlock the hidden harmonies of the universe.  One technique, a simple yet profound concept, had struck a chord within me: the imposition of a frame upon the chaos of the world, a square boundary that reduced the multiplicity of experience to a unified whole.\n\nAnd yet, as I stood before the offending bundle, my mind recoiled in the face of such simplicity.  The mess before me defied the neat compartmentalization of art.  It was a thing, a thing that had once lived, a thing that now lay broken and discarded, a thing that mocked my attempts to impose order upon it.  I thought of the masters: Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance's kaleidoscope of color.  And I, a lowly aspirant, stood before this, this thing, and felt the weight of my own insignificance.\n\nMy hand, a clumsy instrument, hovered over the handle of the toilet.  The muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed once more, as if driven by a will beyond my own.  The handle, a stubborn obstacle, refused to yield to my touch.  I stood, a figure of futility, as the seconds ticked by like grains of sand in an empty hourglass.  My grip on the mop relaxed, my feet shifted, and I stared, a man transfixed, at the thing that lay before me.\n\nA few more moments passed, each one a tiny, insignificant droplet in the vast ocean of time.  And then, my hand, a puppet on a string, moved towards the wall, grasped the sheet of toilet paper, and began to wrap itself in a chilling shroud.  I stood, a figure of desolation, and dipped my hand into the depths of the bowl, a gesture both intimate and grotesque.",
            "In the desolate landscape of America's roads, a terrible toll is exacted upon the young.  Teenagers succumb to the unforgiving wheel, their lives extinguished by the very thing meant to set them free.  The National Institutes of Health have shed light on the calamitous forces at play, revealing that the adolescent brain is woefully unprepared to confront the perils of the highway.  Inexperience, that most insidious of demons, stalks the roads, claiming its victims with ruthless efficiency.  It is a specter that haunts not only the statistics, but the families left to mourn the loss of their loved ones.\n\nThe burden of inexperience is compounded by the siren's call of peer pressure.  For it is in the company of friends that the young are most likely to take the fatal leap, their hormones and hubris conspiring against them.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the correlation between youthful companionship and the carnage that ensues.  The numbers are a stark reminder of the horrors that unfold on American roads.\n\nIn response, various states have implemented provisional licenses, attempting to mitigate the carnage.  These measures, while well-intentioned, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound.  The true issue lies deeper, a systemic failure to reckon with the harsh realities of the road.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has sounded the alarm, suggesting that even the venerable age of 18 may be too soon to entrust the wheel to the young.  His research reveals a disturbing propensity among the young to court danger for its own sake, a reckless abandon that defies comprehension.  It is a tendency that must be checked, lest the death toll continue to climb.\n\nBy 2010, the demographic bulge of the Baby Boomers will reach its zenith, unleashing a tidal wave of new drivers upon the nation's roads.  The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic.  But legislation can still stem the tide.  A national standard, one that prohibits drivers under the age of 18, is a reasonable and necessary step.  Schools can continue to provide the foundation of driver's education, while a provisional permit can serve as a stepping stone to full licensure.  The requirement of practical training hours, a tried and true measure, can be standardized across the nation.\n\nThis is not a radical proposal, merely a recognition of the stark reality that faces us.  The time for half-measures is past; it is time for a comprehensive solution to the scourge of teen driving.  Uniform national legislation is the only way to ensure that the next generation of Americans is not lost to the void of the highway.",
            "In the depths of the Library of Congress's vast repository, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's earliest films, the trick films of 1895 to 1901. Fifteen such relics lay before me, their creaking reels a testament to the nascent art of cinematic deception. My study was to unravel the poetic threads that wove these illusions, to discern the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in the later years. The trick films of the turn of the century were bound by strict conventions: set-bound, frontal proscenium compositions, static cameras, and a adherence to the tyranny of the single shot.\n\nYet, like ravens on the periphery of a dying flame, a few films dared to break free from these shackles, introducing innovations such as the fragmented shot. In these early years, the camera remained rooted, a sentinel guarding the frame of the proscenium, as the figures within danced across the stage. This theatrical heritage, born from the vaudeville and magic acts of a bygone era, imposed its own limitations. The figures, like puppets on strings, moved only laterally, never venturing forth or receding from the camera's gaze. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, as if bound by an unseen force. Even as they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, a monolith to the frozen moment.\n\nThe proscenium's straitjacket also dictated the cinematographic vocabulary: long shots and the occasional medium shot, never the intimate close-up. For in the theatre and vaudeville, the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, frozen in their roles, never breached the middle ground, their faces and actions a tableau for the viewer's scrutiny. Hence, the close-up, a tool of nuance and subtlety, was an alien concept in these early trick films.\n\nThe rule of one conceptual shot, one physical shot held sway, limiting the films to a brevity that bordered on the ephemeral. Most trick films, like fleeting whispers in the wind, vanished in less than a minute, their frames a blurred shadow of a narrative. Their focus, a vaudeville-style trifecta of magic, disappearance, and switching acts, left little room for dramatic depth. Yet, as one delves deeper, the façade cracks, revealing the cunning artifice that underpinned these deceptions. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion of a severed head is unmasked, the moment of its creation revealed, like a conjurer's sleight of hand. The single shot, a mere illusion, was in truth a collage of joined fragments, a testament to the early filmmakers' resourcefulness in the art of deception.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of America's early years, a figure emerged who would leave an indelible mark upon the nation's formative days. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land and a warrior of conviction, stood resolute in his dedication to the principles of Republicanism. His hands, worn rough from the toil of the earth, had also grasped the reins of politics, tempering his agrarian roots with a fervor for personal freedom and government restraint. The twin pursuits of his life – the cultivation of the land and the shaping of the nation's destiny – had forged a man unyielding in his resolve.\n\nFor Taylor, the agrarian Ideal was the very foundation upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were erected. It was a vision of a society where the common man, untainted by the corruptions of power, might live unfettered by the encroaching grasp of government. In this vast and untamed expanse, he saw the potential for a system of self-government, unshackled by the weight of tradition, to take root and flourish.\n\nThe notion of the \"state of nature\" – a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak – was an affront to Taylor's sensibilities. In a civilization, he believed, this brutal calculus must be tempered by the presence of a government that accounted for the duality of human nature. \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human,\" he wrote, a dictum that underscored his conviction in the dualistic morality that governed human affairs.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's estimation, must be founded upon principles that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. It was a system that would function equitably, regardless of the administrators who might seek to exploit its power for personal gain. Self-interest, he acknowledged, was the driving force behind human action, but it was only when this impulse led to the subjugation of others that it became a malignancy that must be checked.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor was a proponent of a strict construction of the Constitution, one that limited the Federal government to the powers explicitly granted by the document. He knew that an extensive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, but he also recognized that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the text was fraught with peril. It was a path that could lead to corruption, as the intent of the framers was lost in the cold calculus of power. Even more, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the American experiment, a document that spoke to the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of the endeavor, a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions precipitated a sense of unease. The cause of this decline eluded us, lost in the crepuscular haze of winter's onset. The New England campus, blanketed in snow, witnessed a decline in pedestrian and cyclist traffic, a likely contributor to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought a maelstrom of activity: final exams, grades, and the attendant chaos of year's end. Amidst this maelstrom, the commuter log may have been cast aside, forgotten in the rush to complete the semester's business. The holiday season, too, brought a respite from academic toil, a month-long interlude in which the campus was all but deserted. The resumption of classes in late January offered a possible explanation for the paucity of submissions, but none adequately accounted for the lull that persisted into February. It was as if the initial fervor of the project had given way to a natural ennui, a waning of interest that defied explanation.\n\nIn an effort to counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a high-intensity campaign designed to rekindle the initiative's flame. The results were telling: a surge in log submissions in March, a testament to the power of focused effort. Yet, this success merely highlighted the challenges that lay ahead: how to sustain momentum in the face of seasonal lulls and the deeply ingrained cultural preference for the freedom and independence afforded by driving one's own vehicle. This preference, a pervasive aspect of our society, posed a significant obstacle to the project's success.\n\nThe provision of incentives, in the form of gift certificates to local establishments, was a necessary countermeasure to this entrenched preference. We offered prizes to be redeemed at local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, among other venues. It was a curious exercise, this attempt to nudge behavior through the promise of reward. One could not help but wonder, however, if more substantial prizes might have yielded greater results. A bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle – such prizes might have trumped the allure of personal freedom and flexibility, at least for a time. The value of the prizes, however, remained constant throughout the project. A variable that might have been tweaked to greater effect: had we announced the addition of more substantial rewards, perhaps in December and again in January, the project's fortunes might have been reversed. The gift cards, once sufficient, may have proved insufficient in the face of time's steady erosion of interest.",
            "In the depths of the financial labyrinth, there exists a creature known as the ETF - a hybrid beast that combines the characteristics of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock, trading on the exchanges with the ease of a common commodity.  It is said to offer the diversification of a fund and the singular benefits of individual stock ownership: the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in any transaction.  Yet, like all things that seem too good to be true, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund, a tantalizing prospect for the astute investor.\n\nBut, as with all things, there are costs to be reckoned with.  The commission on each trade, a burden that weighs heavily on the investor's wallet, is a persistent thorn in the side of those who would seek to profit from the ETF's flexibility.  And then, of course, there is the question of the ETF's true nature, a shroud of mystery that hangs over the financial landscape like a dark and foreboding cloud.  Does it truly offer the diversification it promises, or is it merely a facade, a clever ruse designed to lure the unwary into its depths?\n\nTo answer these questions, we have chosen to examine the ETF IHF, a creature of particular interest in the financial world.  We have selected the top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the ETF's assets, and set out to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are truly equivalent to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the 10 constituent stocks.  We have also sought to discover whether there exist better configurations of these same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would be a Sisyphean task to include every holding in our analysis.  Therefore, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which will give us a snapshot of the ETF's true nature.  Below, we present the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we have calculated the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion established by the ETF's holdings.  The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe data reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11%, a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a significant reduction in risk.  These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, the possibility remains that these results may be due to chance, and not statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to facilitate comparison with the ETF IHF.  By examining these results, we hope to determine whether the top 10 holdings truly capture the essence of the ETF, or whether they are merely a pale imitation.",
            "In the somber depths of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his unfaltering grasp of the darker recesses of the human experience. It is a poem that burrows into the very marrow of existence, where the veil between reality and the abyss is worn thin. In its spare, haunting lines, Poe invokes the enigmatic term \"Thulé\", a word that echoes through the ages like a mournful whisper. This invocation, noted by the keen-eyed Mabbott, finds its antecedent in the venerable Virgil, who spoke of a distant isle, a Thulé that marked the furthest reach of the known world, a precipice beyond which the unknown stretched out like an endless, dark sea.\n\nBut Virgil's debt to the mystery of Thulé is matched by another, a more proximate and insidious one. Poe's fascination with the German masters, those titans of the Romantic era, casts a long shadow over his work. His affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, and Karl J. Arndt's astute analysis of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\" reveals a kinship that goes beyond mere admiration. Poe's appropriation of Goethe's themes and motifs is a thread that weaves its way through the labyrinthine corridors of his poetry.\n\nIn Goethe's \"Faust\", a work that would become a touchstone for the Romantic movement, we find a poem that bears an uncanny resemblance to \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thulé\", a short, searing elegy, tells the tale of a monarch undone by grief and loss. His wife, a radiant presence, has departed this mortal coil, leaving behind a shattered king, lost in a sea of sorrow. His is a world of shadows, a realm devoid of color, where the very fabric of existence is rent asunder by the weight of his anguish. In this bleak, desolate landscape, we find a dark doppelganger for the speaker of \"Dream-Land\", a mirror held up to the abyss that yawns within.\n\nThe connection between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" is more than a mere coincidence. It is a testament to the crucible of Poe's imagination, a furnace that forges the raw material of his art into a seamless, unbroken whole. And at the heart of this synthesis lies the figure of Goethe, a colossus of the literary world, whose work Poe would have known and revered, if only through his veneration of Tennyson. Poe's admiration for the British poet was matched only by his respect for the German master, whose work he would have encountered in the countless translations and adaptations that flooded the literary landscape of his time.\n\nThus, in the twilight realm of \"Dream-Land\", we find a world that is at once a reflection of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" and a testament to the boundless power of Poe's imagination. It is a world of shadows, a realm of unrelenting sorrow, where the very fabric of existence is torn asunder by the weight of human despair. And at its center, a figure that is at once both Poe and Goethe, a monarch of the abyss, lost in the dark, endless expanse of Thulé.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's laws, a question arises: can a customer, beset by the cruel whims of fate, claim punitive damages for a fall precipitated by an applesauce spill in a grocery store, where the store manager, driven by a hunger for dinner, ignored pleas for assistance, turning a blind eye to the impending doom of others? The cold-hearted pursuit of relief by Jennifer Palmer may find some solace in the law, for a judge is unlikely to dismiss her claim with utter contempt. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall those who venture into the defendant's domain, coupled with conduct so despicable it defies the very fabric of human decency.\n\nPalmer's argument is built upon the foundation of past transgressions: the store's failure to address the spill, despite the knowledge of its probable consequences, is a willful act that disregards the rights and safety of its patrons. The precedent of past slip-and-fall incidents, a litany of suffering and pain, is a stark reminder of the store's negligence. Six such incidents in the year 2009, a numbing tally of human suffering, serves as a testament to the store's callous disregard for its customers.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, a employee, Rich Wayne, approached his manager, Paul Martin, with a warning of the impending danger. Martin's response, a dismissive wave of his hand, a careless acknowledgement that he was too engrossed in his dinner to bother with the concerns of others. The same callousness was repeated when Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, brought the spill to his attention, and Martin's response was one of indifference. And then, at 5:30 pm, the inevitable occurred: Jennifer Palmer, a woman whose life would never be the same, slipped and fell on the spill, her back shattered, her world forever altered.\n\nThe law of California is clear: a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract, if the defendant's actions are driven by \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, a term oft-bandied about in the courts, is defined as conduct that intends to cause harm, or, in its absence, a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.

            "It has been nigh on four years since I wandered into a realm of inquiry, a course on Islam at the CBC, where the fervent discussions raged like a desert storm.  The query that consumed us, like a dry wind, was whether Islam was a creed of hostility.  The question seemed then, and seems now, a pertinent one.  In the crucible of time, since the calamity of 9/11, I have witnessed the media's fervent zeal shift from a scathing vitriol towards Islam, to an unwavering tolerance.  It is a transformation as improbable as a mirage that vanishes at dawn, leaving naught but dust and ash.  And yet, I dare say, it is a transformation that would have been deemed unthinkable in the year 2001, when a candidate with the unassuming surname of Obama, and a heritage so deeply intertwined with the Muslim world, could have never ascended to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a enigma, a puzzle that defies easy solution.  I had always thought, based on the fragmented knowledge I had gathered, that Muhammad was a conqueror, a man who rode the tides of history with an iron fist, compelling the conquered to submit to his creed.  But the biography presents a different tale, one of a man humbled, a man who suffered the slings and arrows of circumstance, and emerged, like a phoenix from the ashes, a martyr to his own conviction.  It is a narrative that challenges my understanding, a narrative that suggests that people were drawn to his message, not by force, but by the quiet conviction that emanated from his very being.\n\nThere are parallels, too, between the ministries of Jesus and the deeds attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of mutton and milk, a tale of plenty that seemed to defy the laws of nature, is one such example.  It is a story, I dare say, that bespeaks a deeper truth, one that speaks to the power of humility, of a man who needed no external validation, but was content to live a life of quiet conviction.  But, like a thief in the night, this story steals from the life of Jesus, reducing it to a pale imitation, a shadow of the real thing.\n\nThe biography is replete with stories, tales that aim to provide testament to the veracity of Muhammad's message.  But, like a whispered rumor, they are often relayed second-hand, a story within a story, a tale told by someone who heard it from someone else, and so on.  It is a narrative device that, while intended to convey the weight of truth, strikes me as a thin veil, a fragile membrane that separates fact from fiction.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of sainthood, to portray him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness.  But history, like a harsh wind, blows away the veil of myth, revealing a more complex, more nuanced figure, one who rose to power through a combination of charisma, cunning, and circumstance.  And I am left to wonder, what do the faithful of today know of the real Muhammad, of the man behind the myth?",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, the teachings of Jesus, like autumn leaves on a forgotten tree, withered and fell away from the tree of Christian thought.  The seasons of history bore witness to a slow erosion, a gradual drift from the original intent of the faith.  The landscape of Christian doctrine, once a barren wasteland, sprouted weeds of tradition and dogma, choking out the tender shoots of truth.  In the present, a glimmer of awareness flickers, a dying ember of a forgotten flame.  The traditionalists, rooted in the soil of their forebears, resist the creeping awareness, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them shifts like the shifting sands of the desert.\n\nYet, it is in this darkness that a glimmer of light will emerge.  A yearning will stir, a hunger to strip away the accretions of time, to lay bare the foundational truths of the faith.  It will take time, decades or centuries, but the inexorable tides of history will sweep away the accumulated detritus, revealing the stark, unvarnished truth of Jesus' message.  A movement will gather momentum, a tide of reformers seeking to reclaim the lost innocence of the faith, to strip away the layers of doctrine, to return to the pure, unadulterated essence of the Gospel.\n\nIn this great reversal, the church, that stalwart institution, will stand firm, a beacon of continuity in a world in flux.  But the theological clock will have moved backward, its hands unwinding like a spool of thread, as the proliferation of diversity gives way to an eerie uniformity.  Across the land, between denominations, between regions, the differences will melt away, leaving behind a stark, unvariegated landscape of sameness.  The great reversals of history are legion: the crucible of persecution that forged a Christian empire from the ashes of the Roman; the torturous march from slavery to freedom in the Promised Land.  And so it will be again, as the great reversion comes, undoing the tangled skein of history, seeking the lost source, and, in the process, dissolving the rich tapestry of diversity into a monochromatic whole.\n\nIt is in this context that Jesus' words, once literal and unyielding, will be seen anew, as metaphors, symbols, and invitations to a deeper truth.  And what is the source of this great reversal?  Look back, and the history of the faith unwinds like a scroll, unrolling the tale of a people, the Jews, who, in the distant past, knew only the stark, unvarnished truth of the One God, the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, and the tremulous fear of the divine.  A people divided, a people in disarray, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the rest, each with their own vision, their own interpretation, their own truth.  But in the end, it is not the multiplicity of voices that will prevail, but the singularity of the message, the unyielding truth of the Gospel, stripped bare of the ornamentation of time.",
            "The abyss that lies at the heart of humanity yawns open like a chasm, a void of avarice and self-regard that consumes all in its path. The Jungle, a testament to this desolate truth, lays bare the callousness of a society that prizes gold above all else, its people reduced to mere pawns in a game of unyielding progress. The factories, behemoths of industry, loom like specters on the horizon, their smoke-stained spires reaching for the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by unbridled ambition.\n\nAs Upton Sinclair's words paint a picture of this bleak landscape, the pollution that chokes the air and the rivers is a constant companion to the unrelenting drive for profit. The chimneys, like titans of industry, belch forth their noxious fumes, a perpetual affront to the senses, a testament to the disregard for life that drives the owners and managers of these sweatshops. The fecund pens of Packingtown, teeming with the waste of the animals that supply the meatpacking industries, serve as a grim reminder of the callousness that underlies this system, a system that values the bottom line above all else.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in the machine, toil in a sea of suffering, their hours long, their pay meager, their lives a constant struggle to eke out a meager existence. The owners and managers, their eyes fixed on the dollar, care not for the welfare of those who toil for them, nor for the lives they destroy in the process. \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is a cauldron of bitter rivalries and hatreds, a place where decency and loyalty are but a distant memory, where a man's worth is measured by his worth to the dollar.\" The layoffs come without warning, the terminations a mere whisper in the wind, the consequences of which are borne by the workers, left to fend for themselves in a system devoid of compassion or kindness.\n\nIn the era of The Jungle, the law offered little solace to the workers, a meager shield against the unyielding might of the factory owners and managers. The unions, meant to be a bastion of hope, often proved to be a mere puppet of the very system they sought to overthrow, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in serving the working class. The workers, enslaved by the system, were forced to endure the worst of conditions, their lives a never-ending struggle to survive, their worth measured by their value to the machine. And in this bleak landscape, immorality was as inevitable as the rising sun, a constant companion to the despair that gripped the hearts of those who toiled in Packingtown.",
            "In the realm of literature, authors weave a tapestry of meaning, employing various techniques to imbue their subjects with a particular hue. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, is a master weaver of this tapestry. He coaxes his readers into a particular state of mind by juxtaposing words in unexpected harmony, thereby imbuing the ordinary with an aura of significance. The novelist's deft use of symbolism, too, is noteworthy, wherein a single color can evoke a world of connotations. The colors of gold, green, white, and gray – a diaphanous quartet – swirl through the narrative like wisps of smoke, their meanings coalescing into a rich patina.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously crafts an idiom of white and gray, those insidious sibling hues that bespeak the banality of existence. White, with its hint of the rarefied and the refined, is paired with gray, the color of dust and decay. This dichotomy is seeded in the novel's opening pages, where the protagonists, Daisy and Jordan, are forever draped in white, their attire a testament to the stifling uniformity of the elite. The narrative is replete with examples of this juxtaposition: Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's soiree, Tom sports a white shirt when encountering the lowly Myrtle, while Catherine's complexion is likened to powdered milk. Even the city's landscape is not immune to this chromatic schema, as Nick traverses the \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the names on his timetable reduced to \"gray names\", and Catherine's apartment a mere \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\".\n\nAs Fitzgerald painstakingly builds this lexicon of meaning, he eventually employs these colors to signify the crushing banality of the subjects they represent. The process begins with Daisy, that enigmatic cipher at the heart of the narrative. After a protracted absence from the color palette, Daisy reappears dressed in white, her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serving as a harbinger of her growing irrelevance. The once-vibrant Daisy is now reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform entity longed for by Gatsby but ultimately bereft of depth or substance. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, with Fitzgerald employing the color scheme to underscore the vacuity of the characters and their world.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful stroke, a deft manipulation of the reader's perceptions, wherein the ordinary is transformed into the extraordinary. In the world of The Great Gatsby, the colors of white and gray serve as a potent symbol of the hollowness at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The land of San Diego County lay fertile, a paradise for the farmer's art, its mild and sun-kissed climate coaxing forth a tapestry of bounty from the earth. Tomatoes ripened on the vine, their red skins glistening like rubies in the desert sun. Leafy greens burst forth from the soil, their delicate leaves a vibrant green, while squash and broccoli swayed in the breeze like sentinels guarding the land's hidden riches. Herbs and tree fruits, peaches and lemons, berries and peppers, all vied for attention in the verdant landscape. And honey, the golden nectar of the gods, dripped from the hives like a blessing from above. Yet, amidst this plenty, a sense of unease lingered, a nagging awareness of the costs of this prosperity.\n\nThe demand for organic community-supported agriculture was a palpable thing, a hunger that drove consumers to wait in line, their pockets deep and their resolve unshaken. Organic eggs and milk, the very lifeblood of the land, were sought after with an almost fanatical devotion. And the farmers, those rugged sons and daughters of the earth, toiled tirelessly to meet this demand, their sweat and toil a testament to their commitment to the land and its secrets.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer was not an easy one. The sun beat down upon their back, the soil cried out in parched desperation, and the pests and weeds conspired against them, a relentless horde of enemies to be vanquished. The costs were high, the labor intense, and the losses a constant, gnawing worry. Yet, the rewards were great, for in this land of plenty, the farmer found a sense of purpose, a connection to the earth that was both primal and profound.\n\nIn the town of Potrero, a small haven nestled in the heart of the San Diego County, a landowner's dilemma played out like a tragedy. A parcel of 160 acres, a verdant tapestry of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, lay before them, a challenge waiting to be seized. The Cleveland National Forest loomed large, a sentinel guarding the secrets of the land. And the ecoregion, that vast and mysterious realm, whispered its secrets to the wind, a siren's call to the landowner's ears.\n\nThis land had been home to the Native Americans for untold centuries, their spirits lingering in the ancient trees, their stories whispered on the wind. The cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, their legacy a testament to the land's enduring power. And now, a small farmer, driven by a dream of sustainability and a connection to the land, sought to claim this parcel as their own.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website, my eyes scanning the digital landscape for a glimpse of the land's hidden potential. And then, I researched the government programs, a maze of bureaucratic red tape waiting to ensnare the unwary. But I persevered, driven by a determination to uncover the hidden paths to success, to find the secrets that lay hidden in the land's ancient heart. And so, I located an organic farm in the same area, a beacon of hope in a world of uncertainty.",
            "In the crucible of negotiation, culture is a fire that burns with a fierce and unforgiving intensity. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what is and what is not, of what signifies and what remains unseen. And like a mirage on a desert plain, culture shifts and distorts, refusing to be grasped or defined. Statements that purport to capture its essence - \"all Russians are stubborn,\" \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - are nothing more than feeble attempts to pin the beast to the ground, to tame its unyielding spirit.\n\nBut the negotiator who would succeed must learn to navigate this labyrinthine landscape, to listen for the whispers of significance that underlie the surface of a culture. For it is not the broad strokes of generalization that will serve him well, but rather a nuanced understanding of how a culture's values and attitudes will shape the delicate dance of the negotiation. When one approaches a foreign culture, the familiar contours of his own world rise up like a specter, casting shadows that are at once comforting and misleading.\n\nTo truly comprehend a culture, one must be willing to immerse oneself in its depths, to drink from the well of its history, and to confront the prejudices that lurk in every shadow. It is not a matter of judging or changing, but of accepting the culture for what it is, and working within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are highest and the odds are against him. And when one finds himself a stranger in a strange land, a respect for the traditions and beliefs that govern the culture can be a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding him through the treacherous waters of the negotiation.\n\nBut culture is not a fixed or static thing, tied to the petty boundaries of nation or geography. It is a living, breathing entity that pulses with the rhythm of the corporate heart. Within the walls of a single company, a culture can be as vibrant and diverse as the individuals who inhabit it. One company may be a bastion of long hours and stern discipline, while another may be a bastion of relaxation and camaraderie. The dress code may be a badge of honor, or a symbol of rebellion. Communication may be direct and brutal, or indirect and nuanced. The values that guide the company may be a mystery, or an open book.\n\nIt is in the values that we find the why of a culture, the unseen forces that drive it forward. If saving face is a paramount concern, then the negotiator must be delicate and circumspect, lest he risk offending the very fabric of the culture. If a culture values the hard-won bargain, then the negotiator must be prepared to engage in a struggle that is both fierce and unforgiving. And yet, it is in the values that we also find the key to effective negotiation, for it is the personal touch that can make the difference between success and failure.\n\nBy understanding the values and attitudes of his opponent, the negotiator can begin to see the world through his eyes, to feel the weight of his concerns and the depth of his convictions. And it is in this moment of empathetic understanding that the true art of negotiation begins to take shape, a delicate dance of give and take that is as much a matter of art as it is of science.",
            "The fool has spoken his mind, \"There is no God,\" a notion that echoes through the hollow chambers of Psalm 14, and finds itself entwined with the thoughts of a man named Anselm. It is a thread that runs parallel to the musings of another, Thomas Aquinas, a man consumed by the weight of reason and the cold light of evidence. We are drawn into a dance of words, a pas de deux between these two thinkers, each one striving to grasp the elusive figure of the divine. And so we begin with a premise, a leap of faith, for the sake of brevity's sake, that both men speak of a God, a God of the Bible, a God of blood and bone and spirit. To invite other possibilities would be to invite confusion, a maelstrom of interpretations that would mire our understanding.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, Anselm's words unfold like a tapestry, a slow and deliberate unraveling of the threads of understanding. He speaks of a path that winds inward, a journey into the recesses of the soul, where the proof of God resides. It is a notion that echoes the whispers of the mind, a gentle susurrus that speaks to the heart of all things. He argues that the existence of God cannot be conceived, cannot be comprehended, for it is a truth that lies beyond the reach of mortal men. It is a faith that is inextricably bound to the very fabric of our being, a thread that runs deep into the marrow of our bones.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stands apart, a figure of reason and logic, a man who seeks to prove the existence of God through the cold light of evidence. He presents five arguments, each one a shard of glass that refracts the light of truth, casting shadows on the wall of doubt. He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each one a chapter in the grand tome of reason. He argues that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a thread that weaves its way through the very fabric of the universe. And so, he says, we can know of God's existence, not through faith, but through the logic of the human mind.\n\nIn this dance of words, we find ourselves lost in the labyrinth of their thoughts, searching for a thread to guide us through the darkness. And yet, as we listen to their words, we are drawn to the realization that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a complete answer, a holistic basis for belief in God. Their words are like two sides of a coin, each one incomplete without the other, each one a fragment of a greater whole.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of a bygone era, a prince would take his first breath, a prince who would one day be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would stray far from the path of the world, and in the desolate expanse of his renunciation, he would find enlightenment. His teachings, like a slow-moving river, would carve a course through the ages, giving rise to the formidable edifice of Buddhism. The most austere and unyielding of its sects, Theravada Buddhism, would emerge as a bastion of orthodoxy, its contours shaped by the vicissitudes of time. The passage of twenty five hundred years would see the once-pristine waters of the faith become muddied, its outlines distorted, like a reflection in rippling waters. This metamorphosis is nowhere more evident than in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with fervor. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this ritual, their participation a testament to the indomitable will to preserve tradition. Yet, this ceremony, a celebration born of fervent devotion, holds no place in the Buddha's teachings, a stark reminder that the fabric of the faith has been tempered by the fires of time.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community, a tapestry woven from the threads of monastic and lay perspectives, has been forced to adapt its doctrinal principles in the face of forces both internal and external, benevolent and malevolent. These forces, like a pair of opposing winds, have buffeted the community, shaping its course in ways both subtle and profound.\n\nIn this discussion, certain qualifying terms will be employed with frequency. The internal and external dichotomy will be a recurring theme. An internal force is understood as a force born of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of its monastic or lay provenance. Conversely, an external force is any influence emanating from non-Buddhist circles. A hostile force is one that seeks to damage or undermine the Buddhist community, its animosity born of a malevolent perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither seeks to harm nor assist the community, its actions often yielding unintended consequences.\n\nIt is essential to excavate the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the faith is constructed. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine corpus, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka harbors the metaphysical underpinnings of the faith. These notions include the concept of Anatta—no self, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Only through a profound recognition of these concepts can the cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be broken, and with it, the twin specters of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. In the Vinaya Pitaka, a lattice of rules is set forth for the layman and the monk alike. For the layman, five precepts are decreed: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in illicit behavior, and I shall not partake of intoxicants. For the monk, a more austere regimen is prescribed. The four noble truths, the very bedrock of the faith, stand as the most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism. First, the truth that life is suffering, Dukkha. Second, that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, that suffering can be transcended.",
            "The animosity between the United States and Mexico had been a festering wound for nigh on 57 years, its bitter edges sharpened by the harsh realities of a contentious past. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations were locked in a struggle that would test their mettle, a clash of wills that would leave scars that would take years to heal. The high watermark of this conflict came in 1846-1848, when the United States, driven by a hunger for expansion, clashed with Mexico in a war that would leave its mark on the continent. The spoils of victory were Texas and the American Southwest, territories wrested from the defeated nation, their annexation a bitter pill for Mexico to swallow.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident, for the rift between the two nations was rooted in deeper, more fundamental differences. Their cultures, like two opposing forces, had long been at odds, their traditions and values in stark contrast to one another. The material interests that drove them were in direct conflict, a clash of titans that would not be easily resolved. As Schmitt noted, the discord between the two nations was a legacy of the English and Spanish, the colonial powers that had once ruled over them, leaving behind a legacy of distrust that would take generations to overcome (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a tale as old as time, a story that has played out in the annals of history, where nations sharing a border have found themselves at odds over issues both great and small. The United States and Mexico were not unique in this regard, their rivalry a microcosm of the deeper struggles that have shaped the world. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (Pletcher 1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their enmity.\n\nThe issue of religion had been a point of contention, a source of discord that had divided the two nations for centuries. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (Frahm 2001, p. 86), a sentiment that would shape their relations with Mexico, a nation with a strong Catholic heritage. This was not simply a matter of ideology, but a fundamental clash of values, a struggle that would not be easily resolved.\n\nThe distrust between the two nations was rooted in the legacy of their colonial past, the animosity that had been sown by the English and Spanish, the powers that had once ruled over them. This was a wound that would take years to heal, a legacy that would continue to shape their relations for generations to come. As Diehl and Goerts noted, there were 17 disputes between the two nations during this period, the majority of which were territorial in nature, a testament to the ongoing struggle for control of the borderlands (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).\n\nThe border raids, the lawlessness that had plagued the region, were a symptom of a deeper disease, a reflection of the distrust that had taken root between the two nations. It was not until both sides exerted military force on their borders that the situation began to abate, a testament to the enduring nature of their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). It was only when Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States, and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention, that the rivalry began to subside (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110). The wounds of the past would take time to heal, but the legacy of their rivalry would continue to shape their relations for years to come.",
            "It was fifteen years ago that calamity descended upon me like a shroud, a mysterious illness that shattered the fragile vessel of my existence. I was a nurse, a calling born of a childhood's stark desolation, a desperate search for the security that had forever eluded me. \"You'll always find work,\" they had whispered, a hollow mantra that echoed through the chambers of my adolescence. And so, though the path of science and journalism beckoned, I chose the safer, more comforting route. But fate, it seemed, had other designs.\n\nForty-six winters had passed, and I stood alone, drained of all but the bare essentials. The meager earnings of a life on Social Security Disability had long since been exhausted, leaving nothing but a hollow husk of what once was. Each day was a struggle, a constant assault on the fragile walls of my self-esteem. And yet, amidst this desolate landscape, one truth remained: I could not have endured without the tender mercies of those who had seen fit to lend a hand. Friends, family – they were the thin thread that had held me together, the flickering candle that had guided me through the dark.\n\nIn a world where certainties are in short supply, where the wind howls and the earth trembles, it is easy to forget the value of community. We speak of rugged individualism, of a self-reliance that would see us through the trials of a fallen world. But I know better. I know that it was not the lone wolf that braved the untamed expanse of the American frontier, but the traveler who walked in the company of others, who shared the burden of the unknown. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it to the promised land alone, but in the company of those who had become family.\n\nI do not dismiss the value of preparation, of stockpiling the tools of survival. I have my own cache of supplies, my own arsenal of candles and matches, my own store of non-perishable goods. But these are mere makeweights against the tempests that rage beyond our doors. While we toil in the garden of self-sufficiency, let us not forget the beauty of connection, the fleeting comfort of human touch. Get to know your neighbors, these strangers who share your roof with you. For in the end, it is not the strength of our supplies that will see us through, but the strength of our hearts, the bond that ties us together in a world that would seek to tear us asunder.",
            "The coils of existence unfold like a tattered scroll, a testament to the unforgiving passage of time.  In this desolate landscape of life, organisms twist and turn, their forms shaped by the unforgiving whims of evolution.  Yet, we dare to ask: what unseen forces govern the direction of this meandering path?  What unfathomable constraints dictate the trajectory of their transformation?  Even the esteemed D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 treatise, dared to venture that the zoologist's grasp on the organic forms remained tenuous at best, a fragile web of understanding threatened to unravel at every twist.\n\nToday, we find ourselves no closer to unraveling the mystery.  The threads of mathematical modeling, once promising to illuminate the darkness, remain as elusive as the whispers of the wind.  Yet, we press on, driven by an insatiable hunger to comprehend the labyrinthine paths of mollusk skeletogenesis.  Our study, a tentative foray into the unknown, seeks to marry the discipline of mathematical modeling with the raw, unyielding data of experimental studies.  We aim to unravel the Gordian knot of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, that enigmatic creature of the deep.\n\nWithin the desolate expanse of the shell, a topography of twists and turns unfolds, a testament to the ceaseless passage of time.  The whorls, like the pages of a worn book, turn slowly, each one a chapter in the narrative of existence.  The columella, a spectral axis, guides the spiral path, a constant heartbeat in the darkness.  And at the periphery, the sutures separate each whorl, a demarcation of the passage of time, a reminder that all is flux, and nothing is static.\n\nAs we peer into the shell, a world of apertures unfolds before us, a labyrinth of possibilities.  The shell, a fragile vessel, holds within it the secrets of the ages, a palimpsest of time and space.  We view it from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a different facet of the multifaceted whole.\n\nTo count the whorls, we must navigate this labyrinth, charting the twists and turns of the shell's topography.  We begin at the apex, where the first suture beckons, a portal to the mysterious realm within.  A line is drawn, dividing the shell into two, and we count the whorls, each one a chapter in the never-ending narrative of existence.\n\nAnd so, we follow the aperture, a thread through the tapestry of time, tracing its path through the coordinates of each whorl's center, the horizontal and vertical radius of its path.  This trajectory, a map of the shell's topography, can be graphically and mathematically represented, a fragile, flickering flame of understanding in the darkness.\n\nAnd yet, even as we grasp this thread, it slips through our fingers, leaving us with more questions than answers.  We vary the parameters, modifying the skeletal structures, and the shell, like a living, breathing entity, responds, its form shifting, adapting to the changing landscape of existence.  In this endless dance, we are but fleeting participants, our understanding a mere whisper in the wind.",
            "The stillness of death clung to Indonesia like a shroud, its grip unyielding on the fragile lives of the young.  For a decade, the rates of infant and maternal mortality had held fast, unmoved by the passage of time.  The country's march towards the Millennium Development Goals had been halting, its progress like a man stumbling through a dark forest, the darkness closing in around him with each step.  The waters of progress had been breached, yet the ripples of improvement had not yet reached the distant shores of child and maternal health.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, there was a glimmer of hope.  The numbers told a tale of progress, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, yet the truth was a cruel mistress.  For in the midst of this seeming triumph, the quiet agony of maternal deaths hung like a specter, its presence a testament to the frailty of life.  The skilled hands that attended the births were often those of midwives, their touch a gentle thing, yet powerless against the ravages of a complicated pregnancy.  The numbers, a cold comfort, a reminder that the distance between life and death was not always so far.\n\nThe waters of diarrheal disease had receded, but the children of Indonesia still drank deep from the well of suffering.  The postnatal care, a dark and forgotten corner of the health system, remained a place of shadows and neglect.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4%, a paltry thing, a reflection of the desperation that gripped the rural areas, where the cries of the unborn were drowned out by the din of poverty.\n\nIn the cities, the hospitals stood like beacons, their lights shining bright, but in the rural expanse, the darkness was complete.  The equity of coverage, a mirage on the horizon, beckoned, yet remained elusive.  The poor, a distant cry in the night, their voices lost in the desolate landscape of healthcare, their access to services a privilege reserved for the fortunate few.\n\nThe question loomed, a specter of despair, how to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness.  Should the path be paved with programmatic approaches, a series of isolated interventions, each one a Band-Aid on a festering wound?  Or should the focus be on strengthening the health system, a Herculean task, one that required a commitment to the long haul, to the slow and dusty road of progress?\n\nThe allure of programmatic approaches was great, a siren's call, promising quick fixes and tangible results.  But the cost was steep, the danger of fragmenting the health system, of creating a maze of competing interests, each one a competing claimant for the meager resources.  The duplication of services, a wasteful thing, a bore in the earth of progress, the forms and paperwork, a never-ending cycle of drudgery.\n\nIn the end, the question remained, a haunting thing, a reminder of the fragility of life, and the impermanence of progress.  How to reach the forgotten, how to bring light to the darkness, how to save the lives of the young, and the mothers who would give them life?",
            "In the sweeping expanse of Victorian literature, two novels emerge as anomalies, their twisted threads refusing to be bound by the conventions of their era.  Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, like specters from a darker realm, haunt the traditions of the period, their somber silhouettes cast against the stern backdrop of the aristocracy. These novels veer from the expected, embracing the macabre and the unknown, as if driven by an otherworldly force. This aberration lends depth to their characters, imbuing them with an aura of mystery, inviting the reader to peer into the recesses of their troubled minds.\n\nThe darkness that lay within these characters seethed and churned, like a maelstrom on the horizon. And then, like a fleeting glimpse of the damned, the visage of Sikes and Crackit rose before him, their voices a maddening din that echoed through his mind. \"We were disputing,\" their words whispered, \"and he was caught in the midst of it, his thoughts tangled in the threads of their discord.\" The sound of firearms shattered the air, a cacophony of terror that tore him from the shadows, bearing him away on a tide of chaos. Pain seared his consciousness, a burning brand that scorched his every waking moment, its flames fueled by the anguish that gnawed at his very soul.\n\nIn these dark visions, the lines between reality and nightmare blurred, as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights danced on the precipice of madness. Oliver's inner turmoil unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads woven from the very fabric of his being. The shooting, a moment of unspeakable horror, replayed itself in his mind like a ghastly refrain, a litany of despair that haunted him still. His senses dulled, he was borne away on a tide of fear, his only solace the numbing ache that had become his constant companion. The question hung in the air, a taunting specter, whose cruel hand had brought about his misfortune. Was it his own fate, or the product of forces beyond his control? The answer, like the day itself, seemed to slip through his fingers like sand in the hourglass.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting moment of darkness, lost in the vast expanse of time. It was gone, consumed by the void, leaving only the weight of night, a heavy shroud that suffocated all in its grasp. The hours ticked by, each one a slow and labored breath, a countdown to the dawn that never came. And in this endless night, Oliver's spirit was crushed, his will broken by the weight of his despair, his heart a heavy stone, sunk deep in the darkness of his own private hell.",
            "The dust of recollection settles heavy upon the memories of my time spent in the after-school program, where I labored to instill the fundamentals of reading and English in the young minds of elementary age students. It was in this crucible that I encountered a boy named Adrian, a youth beset by an affliction that seemed at once both confounding and heartbreaking: he could speak English with perfect clarity, yet falter on the most basic aspects of reading. His struggles echoed within me, a dissonance that would not abate until I chanced upon his mother, a woman whose gaze was as foreign as the language she spoke - a language that hung in the air like an invisible veil, an impenetrable barrier that separated her from the world around her. It was in that moment, amidst the silence of unspoken comprehension, that the truth began to reveal itself: Adrian's troubles lay not in his ability to read, but in his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet, a fundamental building block of literacy that had been withheld from him.\n\nThis story I recount, a testament to the insidious nature of the language barrier that pervades our schools, particularly in a state like California, where the multiplicity of tongues and cultures seems to strain against the fabric of our collective understanding. It is a problem that seeks to confound us, to make us doubt our assumptions and our solutions. We are wont to think that language is a fixed entity, a clearly defined construct that can be learned and mastered with ease. But it is not so. For Adrian, the solution lay in the simplest of measures: a tutor's patient hand guiding him through the labyrinth of the alphabet, the gentle coaxing of sounds and meanings from the darkness. Yet for those children who are doubly bereft, those who speak little or no English, the answer is more complex, a Gordian knot that can only be unraveled through a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, a program that seeks to nurture the bilingual minds of our children, is often met with skepticism and trepidation. We are told that it is a costly endeavor, that it will drain resources and yield little in return. But I would counter that this is a misconception, a false narrative that arises from a lack of understanding. The evidence suggests otherwise: children in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers academically. It is not a panacea, but a key that can unlock the doors of understanding for all our children, regardless of their linguistic heritage.\n\nSo how do we proceed? Do we demand that our teachers be bilingual? No, that would be a foolhardy expectation, one that would precipitate a crisis of proportions we cannot imagine. But we can - and must - provide the necessary tools to bridge the chasm of language. We can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever moniker we choose, who are fluent in multiple tongues. We can create an environment that values and celebrates the diversity of our children's language backgrounds, an environment that is as inclusive as it is supportive. In this way, we can begin to chip away at the obstacle of language, to create a future where every child has the opportunity to flourish, to read, to write, and to speak with confidence and precision.",
            "In the twilight of our earliest years, a presence looms, a force beyond our mortal grasp. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others tread the dusty paths of ancient temples, or probe the recesses of their own minds for answers. Many surrender to the faiths bequeathed to them by their forebears, their conviction born of tradition and upbringing. Others, however, reject the edifice of dogma, scorning the notion of a transcendent realm beyond the confines of their own self-absorbed universe. We oscillate between disparate value systems, our spiritual compasses quivering like a compass needle in the void, as we strive to chart a course through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice a low, measured rumble, as we sat on the creaking porch, the rain drumming a relentless beat on the tin roof above. The gutters groaned, overflowing with the deluge, drowning the parched plants along the porch's edge. His eyes, sunken and haunted, seemed to stare into some distant realm, a mixture of searching and remembrance. Months of illness had leached the vitality from his frame, leaving him gaunt and spectral. His hair, once a rich mane, now hung sparse and lifeless. I felt a creeping dread, a sense of irreparable loss, as I watched him struggle to keep his gaze fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond us. I knew that speaking of it would only amplify the ache within us both, so I contented myself with a tentative touch, moving my chair closer to his, and joining him in his somber contemplation.\n\nMy father's passing came in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest of modern medicine, had prolonged his suffering, rendering him a shadow of his former self. What purpose did this serve, I wondered, as I lay alone in the dark, the silence a heavy shroud upon me. I did not pray, for if a God existed, I had long since abandoned any notion that He listened to my pleas. The thought was a cold comfort, a bleak acknowledgment of the abyss that yawned between us.\n\nI had not wished to witness his final passage, to behold the last flicker of life ebbing from his frame. I could not bear to watch the man who had given me life slip into the void. I wanted to recall him in all his vibrant, unbroken glory, not in the fragile, fading shell that now lay before me. Besides, I knew him better than any, better than his family, better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be a bystander to his departure, a mere spectator to the end of his journey. I curled into a fetal ball, wrapping myself in the shroud of my own grief, waiting for the news that would shatter me.\n\nThe silence was my only companion, a silence that wrapped itself around me like a shroud, unbroken and unbroken. No word came, no solace, no comfort. Only the stillness, and the darkness, and the crushing weight of my own despair.",
            "In a dissonant union of terms, the Gothic novel embodies the oxymoronic conjunction of the ancient and the modern, an incongruity that Ian Watt astutely observes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been derided and extolled, its profundity questioned and its capacity for evoking the 'terrible sublime' lauded by some (Burke). The earliest exemplar of the Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the ancient romance and the modern novel to forge a new idiom, a synthesis of theater and nature. In this work, Walpole wove together the tattered threads of medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and tradition, creating a tapestry that would captivate and confound readers for generations to come. At the time of its publication, the term 'Gothic' was a polyvalent label, applied to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs. It was a term freighted with connotations of antiquity and unsophistication, an anachronism in the face of the modernity that was rapidly transforming the world.\n\nYet it was precisely this union of the archaic and the modern that allowed the Gothic novel to endure, its timelessness a testament to its capacity to transcend the boundaries of time and place. As the reader is transported to a world both familiar and strange, the novel's Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, its chivalric ideals and manners casting a long shadow over the present. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms serves as a poignant reminder of a bygone era, an era in which honor, bravery, and competence were the hallmarks of a true knight. This nostalgia for a vanished world was not merely a sentimental exercise, but a cri de coeur, a lament for the passing of a moral order that Walpole saw as being rapidly eroded in his own time.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's writing was a cry of despair, a lament for the loss of a world that seemed to be slipping away from him. His characters, including the enigmatic Frederic, embody the ideals of chivalry with a fervor that is both admirable and excessive. Frederic, a prince of unyielding virtue, has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and his very existence is a testament to the power of honor and courage in the face of adversity. His description is a litany of chivalric virtues: a prince, a sufferer, a man of unwavering commitment to his principles. And yet, this idealized figure is also a product of excess, a Gothic trope that would come to define the genre. In Frederic, we see the apotheosis of the gallant and courteous knight, a figure that would haunt the pages of the Gothic novel for generations to come.",
            "The labyrinthine threads of commerce weave together in an intricate dance, each strand a vital link in the unyielding chain that binds the customer to the raw material, and from thence to the product that satisfies their most primal needs. Supply chain management, a term coined by the sibylline Keith Oliver in 1982, is the unseen hand that governs this odyssey, a conjurer of efficiencies and a weaver of bespoke solutions. It is the master plan that orchestrates the symphony of production, supply, and distribution, a delicate ballet of movement and tempo.\n\nSix discrete elements comprise the nucleus of this grand endeavor: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These pillars, sturdy and unyielding, support the weight of the supply chain, providing a foundation upon which the edifice of customer satisfaction is built. The managers of commerce, wise and foresighted, employ these six elements to craft a narrative of service that is at once swift, efficient, and responsive to the whims of the market.\n\nProduction, the inaugural step in this grand procession, is the fertile soil in which the seeds of success are sown. It is here that the managers of industry must attune themselves to the rhythm of the market, listening to the whispers of the customer's demand, and responding with products that are at once relevant and desirable. The market, a capricious and mercurial force, holds sway over the production process, guiding the manager's hand as they chart the course of their endeavors.\n\nAs the manager navigates the treacherous waters of production, they must also consider the complexities of location, that most critical of variables. Where will the product be manufactured? At which plant will it be crafted, and with what degree of precision and quality? The manager must weigh the competing demands of volume and satisfaction, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable hunger for value and convenience.\n\nThe schedule of workloads and the maintenance of equipment are also crucial considerations, for in the realm of production, every detail is a thread in the intricate tapestry of commerce. A misstep, a miscalculation, can prove costly in the long run, a lesson learned by those who have walked the hallowed halls of retail, where the giants of commerce, Wal-Mart and Target, have honed their craft through the meticulous attention to detail and the relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this grand edifice, is the strategic art of discerning the core capabilities of a facility and forging alliances with partners who share a common vision. A manager must navigate the labyrinth of divisions, each with its unique strengths and specialties, and decide which path to follow, which partnerships to forge, and which opportunities to seize. And in this dance of supply, velocity is the holy grail, the elusive goal of providing quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness in equal measure.",
            "The faded words on the cardboard sign above Ellen's head seemed to bleed into the dusty street, a macabre message scrawled in Sharpie: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The stark phrase hung like a challenge in the sweltering air, a jarring reminder of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of this troubled land. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country shrouded in the shadows of a tyrannical regime, had been ruled by the iron fist of a militant junta since the coup that seized power in 1962. The whispered rumors of a Saffron Revolution, born from the ash of public protests in 2007, spoke of a nation torn asunder by the monastic robes of its people, and the bloodlust of those who would seek to silence them.\n\nIt began with whispers, a gentle murmur of dissent that grew into a roar, as the monks, those revered guardians of the faith, took to the streets to demand justice. Foreign eyes, those of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, had witnessed the horrors of that conflict, and paid the ultimate price for his bravery. His death, like the countless others, was a testament to the unyielding resolve of those who sought to silence the voices of the people. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the very ranks of the junta, spoke of a toll that far exceeded the official count, a grim tally that spoke of a nation lost to madness and despair.\n\nBut this is a story that has been told before, in the dusty tomes of history, where the empires of old rose and fell, their leaders driven by a lust for power, a hunger that knew no bounds. The Romans, those gods-ordained rulers, had decreed their dominance over their people, while in Japan, the emperor was believed to be a deity, sent to guide his people to greatness through the blessings of the divine. And in our own time, the echoes of a bygone era whispered through the halls of power, as a president, a man with a god-complex, held court with the leaders of a world that seemed to have lost its way.\n\nIn the annals of time, there are those who bear witness to the horrors of human nature: Tiananmen Square, where the ghosts of the dead still lingered, their numbers lost to the sands of time; the Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of innocents, driven by the primal urges of hate and fear; and the Third Reich, a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, where the very fabric of humanity was torn asunder by the madness of a single man. These are the echoes of a world in chaos, a world that seems to be forever lost in the darkness of its own making.",
            "The shadow of Duke Ellington looms large over the jazz landscape, his legacy an unyielding testament to the enduring power of creative vision. It is a testament forged in the crucible of time, tempered by the fires of innovation and the patient shaping of his orchestra. The piano, an instrument that could be as subtle as a summer breeze or as piercing as a winter storm, played its part in the compositions chosen for this exercise, but it was Ellington's genius as a composer that truly defined his art. He crafted frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl like a blooming flower, their individual petals of sound unfolding in a tapestry of rich and complex beauty. And yet, he was not averse to tightly coiled phrases, phrases that coiled around the essence of his players like a snake around its prey, coaxing forth the essence of their unique styles.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early masterpiece, stands as a testament to Ellington's willingness to experiment with the very fabric of sound. In this 12-bar blues, the human voice was elevated to an instrument of the highest order, its timbre weaving in and out of the reeds like a summer mist. The piece is a slow, deliberate dance, its six choruses unfolding like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engage in a call and response, the voice beginning smooth as silk, gradually roughening like the bark of a tree. The second chorus revolves around a muted trumpet, its solo a languid elaboration of the melody, replete with the sweet, mournful tones of the blue note.\n\nThe third chorus is a clarinet's lament, its sweeping phrases backed by a piano that trembles like a leaf in the autumn wind. The fourth chorus, a full-bodied echo of the first, sees the brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response, their voices entwined like the branches of a ancient tree. The fifth chorus is a climactic crescendo, the reeds now the initiators of the call, their voices soaring in the high register as the brass and rhythm sections provide a syncopated counterpoint. And in the final chorus, the voice assumes the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument, its sound a primal howl of joy and release.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a piece recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is on full display, his ear for tone color guiding the intricate dance of sound. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a masterclass in the marriage of vocal and instrumental elements, the two sounds blending together like the colors of a sunset on a summer's day. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington's use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, is a testament to his ability to coax the very best from his musicians, the muted trombone introducing the melody with a subtle, seductive elegance.",
            "The yearning had been a constant companion, a gnawing emptiness that refused to be sated. It had begun to take hold when she was a girl, a tender sprout of adolescence pushing its way up through the earth of her soul. Three years had passed, and the ache remained, a stubborn thorn that refused to be plucked. Her desire had shifted, from a thing to a person, yet the void within her remained unfulfilled. The faces of boys had crossed her path, each one a pale imitation of what she sought, and she had watched them with a detached curiosity, a stranger observing the antics of the oblivious.\n\nShe had questioned herself, pored over the mysteries of her own heart, seeking answers that remained elusive. Theories had been proposed, whispered in the darkness of her mind, but they were feeble attempts to grasp the ungraspable. She had lived, a cipher of uncertainty, suspended between the poles of longing and despair.\n\nBut this was not a day like any other. The house, a sanctuary of calm and tranquility, was rent asunder by the sound of her mother's cry. A scream, a raw and anguished cry, cut through the stillness like a knife. She ran, her feet pounding the floor, her heart racing with a mixture of fear and dread. The kitchen, a place of warmth and comfort, was now a scene of chaos and distress.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, her face twisted in a grimace of pain, her voice a barely audible whisper. \"Ow...sweet...take me to the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a desperate plea that shook the daughter to her core. She rushed to her side, her hand reaching out to still the turmoil within her. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice shaking with concern. The answer was a hasty series of instructions, a directions to the car, and the daughter's resolve was set. She lifted her mother, her strength and resolve mingling with her worry and fear.\n\nThe hospital loomed before them, a bastion of sterility and suffering. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung in the air, a noxious cloud that clung to the skin. But she pushed it aside, her mind focused on the task at hand. She carried her mother, a fragile, broken thing, to the reception desk, her voice rising above the din of the waiting room. \"Help! My mother needs attention!\" The faces turned, a blur of concern and compassion, and a wheelchair was produced, a makeshift cradle for her mother's broken body.\n\nThe doctors came, their faces a blur of efficiency and expertise, and her mother was whisked away, a fragile leaf on the wind. She was left to wait, a sentinel of worry, her heart heavy with the weight of her mother's pain. The fall from the stool, a seemingly minor incident, had left her mother broken and battered. The stillness of the house had given way to chaos and confusion, and she was left to pick up the pieces, to try and make sense of the shattered world around her.",
            "The dim lights of a distant world cast long shadows across the expanse of our understanding, yet the promise of the Mediterranean Diet beckons us forward like a siren's call.  Its adherents, a verdant host, feast upon the bounty of plant life - fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes - their tables spread with the trappings of a healthier existence.  They eschew the darkness of saturated fats, instead welcoming the golden glow of monounsaturated oils into their lives.  And in this quiet reverence for the land, they find solace in the gentle warmth of moderate alcohol, a reminder that even in excess, there is a fine line between indulgence and moderation.\n\nThe whispers of prior studies have long whispered of the Med Diet's protective benefits - a shield against the ravages of total and cardiovascular mortality, a gentle breeze that rustles the leaves of weight loss and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.  Yet, a void had existed in our knowledge, a chasm that yawned wide and deep, unexplored and uncharted, where the mysteries of stroke and stroke mortality dwelled.  It is in this void that our study ventures forth, a lone traveler in the wilderness of data, seeking to illuminate the paths that lead to a healthier existence.\n\nOur journey began with 74,886 women, a sisterhood bound together by the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses in 11 states.  Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, we computed the aMed diet score, a metric that sang the praises of their nutrient intake, their tables spread with the bounty of their self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires.\"  And though the years went by, like autumn leaves rustling in the wind, more than 95% of these women remained steadfast, their participation a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance.\n\nTheir reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records, hospital documents, and death certificates.  And where the records were scarce, we relied on the whispered rumors of probable cases, a shadowy realm where 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts dwelled.  We also calculated the body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, a litany of factors that sought to confuse and mislead us.  But we stood firm, our gaze fixed on the horizon, as we adjusted for these confounders, our steps steady and resolute.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical cartographer, charted the course of our inquiry, its terrain marked by the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  And in the end, our findings emerged like a dawn breaking over the horizon - the women who adhered to the Mediterranean Diet, their aMed diet score a beacon of hope, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke, their relative risk a mere 0.71, a testament to the power of a diet that honors the land and the body.",
            "The darkness crept in like a thief in the night, stealing the very foundations of a nation's prosperity. It began in 2007, a year when the behemoths of American finance teetered on the precipice of collapse. Unemployment stalked the land like a specter, the housing market lay in shambles, and the once-mighty corporations, those titans of industry, were reduced to mere shadows of their former selves. And so, we are left to ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how might we prevent its recurrence? The answer lies in the hubris of those who would guide the ship of state, their decisions driven by a reckless abandon that would have far-reaching consequences. They goaded the banks and financial institutions to peddle sub-prime loans to the unwary, to those who could ill afford them, into an economic landscape as fragile as a house of cards.\n\nThe machinery of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, was coerced into buying and repackaging these toxic assets, creating a Frankenstein's monster of a financial system. And when the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, the banks found themselves bereft of capital, their reserves drained by the very chaos they had unleashed. The contagion spread, a cancer that would not be contained, infecting the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were sown in 1999, a year of promise and hubris. The Clinton administration, driven by a lust for power and a desire to enhance their popularity, chose to ease lending restrictions, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Steven Holmes, a prophet of sorts, penned a prescient warning in the pages of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans among low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" His words, a clarion call to beware, fell on deaf ears, and the consequences of their actions would be dire indeed. \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s,\" he wrote, a prediction that would prove all too accurate.\n\nThe economic landscape was transformed by the proliferation of new and complex financial instruments, a veritable Tower of Babel that would eventually collapse under its own weight. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were the instruments of choice, weaving a web of debt that would ensnare the very fabric of the economy. The U.S. households and financial markets, drunk on the sweet nectar of easy credit, overextended themselves, leaving them vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the market. And when the housing bubble burst, the consequences were catastrophic. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that would haunt the nation for generations to come. Bear, Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to a regimen of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their coffers overflowing with mortgage debt, were placed under government control, a testament to the hubris of those who had brought about their downfall.",
            "The stagnant air of exposition clings to the writer's words like the dry dust of a forgotten land.  It is the place where the narrative's wings beat listlessly, a monotone drone that threatens to lull the reader into a state of torpor, their eyes glazing over like the surface of a stagnant pool.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her face a mask of frustration as she wrestles with the siren's song of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition, that seductive fiend, whispers sweet nothings in the writer's ear, urging them to dispense with the tedious details, to hasten the pace and reach the meat of the story.  But it is a deceitful guide, one that promises a quick escape from the tedium of character development, of atmosphere, of the slow unfolding of the narrative's tapestry.\n\nThe cardinal sin of exposition is to tell, rather than to show.  To dump the reader's lap with a veritable feast of facts and figures, leaving them to sort through the morass like a lost traveler in a desert.  In the cinema, it is the awkward exchange, the clunky exposition dump, where one character unloads their entire life story upon another, a cliche-ridden monologue that would put even the most patient viewer to sleep.  In fiction, it is the author's own telling hand that wields the pen of exposition, carving out great chunks of narrative with all the finesse of a hatchet.\n\nConsider, for instance, a heroine whose life has been forever altered by the presence of a man.  We are told of their meeting, of their marriage, of his brutal and senseless murder.  But what of the man himself?  What of the love they shared, the laughter, the tears, the whispered promises in the dead of night?  To reduce their history to a mere paragraph, a cold recitation of facts, is to deny the reader the chance to feel the weight of his loss, to mourn his passing alongside the heroine.  It is to leave their emotions as dry and barren as the page itself.\n\nA writer's task, then, is to breathe life into the bones of the narrative.  To flesh out the characters, to infuse them with the subtle nuances of speech and action, to allow the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their souls.  It is a labor of love, a slow and painstaking craft that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to let the story unfold at its own pace.  For in the end, it is not the telling that matters, but the showing.  The meat of the story, not the bare bones.  The reader's participation, not their tolerance.\n\nAnd so, the writer's hand hovers over the keyboard, poised to strike, ready to begin.  But the temptation to rush, to dispense with the tedious details, is ever-present, a siren's call that beckons them down a path of least resistance.  To indulge, and risk losing the reader in a sea of exposition, or to resist, and risk crafting a narrative that is lean, mean, and alive.  The choice, as ever, is theirs alone.",
            "I watched the newscast from Columbus, Ohio, a city shrouded in the hush of morning's early light. The NBC 4 broadcast, carried on the thirteenth of August in the year of our reckoning, 2011, unfolded like a tapestry of violence and despair. The lead story, a disquieting tale of domestic carnage, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, his face twisted in a grim rictus, his eyes vacant as a doll's. They showed his mug shot, a fleeting glimpse into the abyss that had driven him to stab his wife, her name left unspoken, a forgotten cipher. The report was brief, a mere two minutes of airtime, as if the gravity of the act was too much to bear, a weight that threatened to consume the very fabric of the broadcast.\n\nThe next story, a somber account of a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, seemed to be devoured by the very shadows that shrouded it. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old youth, lay critically injured, his fate hanging in the balance, a threadbare thread of hope suspended between life and death. The SWAT team moved in, a dark and impersonal force, their presence a stark reminder of the violence that lurked in every corner. I couldn't help but wonder if the news would have given the same attention to a similar tale if the victim had been a different hue, if the neighborhood had been a different shade of skin.\n\nThe news continued, a litany of violence and disregard, a litany of lives lost or forever changed. A gunshot hole marred the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder of the randomness of violence, the ease with which it can strike. A .22 caliber bullet, fired from a rifle, had pierced the metal, leaving a trail of uncertainty in its wake. A five-thousand-dollar reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture, a fleeting promise of justice in a world that often seemed devoid of it.\n\nThe forecast, a brief interlude of tranquility, spoke of rain and thunderstorms to come, a respite from the darkness that had plagued the city. The temperatures, a mere afterthought, would hover in the mid to low eighties, a trivial concern in the face of the violence that had consumed the airwaves.\n\nAnother story, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, unfolded like a tired trop, a narrative of a dark-skinned black man, his features reduced to a mere caricature. He wore a hoodie, a symbol of anonymity, a cloak of invisibility. His height, a mere 6 feet tall, his weight, a paltry 150 pounds, seemed almost laughable, a grotesque parody of humanity. The news anchor's voice dripped with an almost cruel emphasis, as if the man's color was the only thing that mattered.\n\nAnd then, like a whisper in the wind, a mention of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, his fate sealed in a 300-month sentence, a number that seemed to hold a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain gravity that the news anchor sought to convey. But what did it matter, really? Was it the length of the sentence, or the fact that he was a Hispanic man, a label that seemed to serve no purpose in the story? The news, a reflection of our collective soul, a soul that seems to shrug at the violence, the injustice, the disregard for life.",
            "In the vast and unforgiving expanse of brotherhood, a bond forms, unyielding and unrelenting. Like a tempest, it sweeps through the souls of two men, leaving in its wake a tempest of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – a maelstrom of fervor that defies the tender mercies of reason. It is here, in the crucible of adversity, that the true mettle of this bond is tried, and the depths of their characters are laid bare. The cost of this union is a heavy one, a burden that must be shouldered by those who would walk this path. To gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, unvarnished and unflinching – a mirror held up to the darkness that lies within.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark upon a journey through a lush, verdant landscape, their footsteps echoing through the stillness like the beat of a funeral drum. The air is thick with the weight of their emotions, as bitter disappointment struggles against the intense pride that threatens to consume them both. It is here, in this fevered moment, that the true nature of their bond is revealed, a tangled web of love and resentment that ultimately proves fatal for one of them. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are given a glimpse into the twisted world of the protagonist, a world in which the lines between good and evil are blurred, and the consequences of one's actions are writ large upon the landscape.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the power of pride, a monolith of emotion that towers over his every waking moment. From the outset, he is driven by a sense of disappointment, a sense that his brother Doodle, crippled by a weak heart, is a constant reminder of all that he has lost. He had dreamed of a brother who could keep pace with him, a companion in the untamed wilderness of their youth. But Doodle's frailty shatters these dreams, leaving the protagonist to grapple with the darkness that lies within. His heart seethes with anger and resentment, a cauldron of emotions that threatens to boil over at any moment. And yet, it is in these moments of fury that we catch glimpses of a deeper love, a love that is both beautiful and terrible in its intensity. The protagonist's thoughts turn to the unthinkable – to suffocating the small child with a pillow – and yet, it is the simple, unguarded smile of his brother that stays his hand, a reminder of the love that lies at the heart of their bond. It is a love that flickers like a candle in the darkness, a fragile flame that threatens to be extinguished by the very emotions that seek to consume it.",
            "The mind is a labyrinthine repository of unfathomable complexity, a vast and dark expanse of neural concatenation. As the epochs pass, so too do the metaphors that have been used to describe it, each one a faint echo of the truth, a fleeting glimpse of the abyss that lies within. From the wax tablet of ancient lore to the papyrus scroll of forgotten knowledge, and from the book of dusty tomes to the cold, calculating machine, the mind has been likened to each in turn. And yet, it is a mistake to cling too tightly to these comparisons, for they are but feeble approximations of the uncharted depths that lie within.\n\nThe process begins with the influx of sensory stimuli, a barrage of raw data that assails the senses like a tempest: the tactile thrum of touch, the fiery kiss of heat, the sonic boom of sound waves, the radiant flash of light. These primal sensations are transformed, transmuted, and reconstituted by the alchemy of the brain, a process of bottom-up and top-down sorcery that weaves the disparate threads of perception into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nThe example of the black box on a white background is a case in point: the bottom-up process, a concatenation of simple, brutish facts – color, orientation, borders – that coalesce into a nascent understanding of the object before us. And yet, it is the top-down process that imbues this nascent understanding with context and significance, that elevates the mere thing to a box, a container of meaning that holds within it the power to persuade and to inform.\n\nAnd yet, even as the mind processes this information, a filter of attention holds sway, a gatekeeper that determines what is worthy of consideration and what is cast aside. The healthy mind is a filter that discriminates, that separates the signal from the noise, the wheat from the chaff. We notice the name, the loved one, the thing that speaks to us on a deep and primal level, even in the midst of cacophony and confusion.\n\nThe storage of information is a further mystery, a process of encoding and maintaining that is still poorly understood. Sensory memory, working memory, long-term memory – each is a distinct and separate realm, a kingdom unto itself. The encoding of information is a process of translation, a conversion of the raw data of the senses into a language that the mind can understand. And the maintenance of this information, the preservation of the encoded signal, is a task of great delicacy, a balancing act between the competing claims of retention and forgetting.\n\nThe models of the mind, the theories of how knowledge is organized within its labyrinthine recesses, are many and varied. Some are based on the way we remember, on the threads of association that connect one idea to another. Others are based on the cold, calculating logic of computer science, on the algorithms that govern the flow of information. And others still are rooted in the dark, mysterious world of neurophysiology, where the secrets of the mind are slowly beginning to yield to the prodding of science.\n\nBut even as we strive to understand the mind, to comprehend the intricacies of its workings, we must never forget that we are but strangers in a strange land, that the truth lies just beyond our grasp, waiting to be seized by the bold and the curious.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley summons the specter of a dystopian future, where the fetid tendrils of technology and the suffocating grip of capitalism entwine to strangle the last vestiges of humanity. The inhabitants of this bleak realm, conditioned from the earliest stages of their existence to crave fleeting pleasures above all else, stumble through lives devoid of purpose, their existence a hollow mockery of true human experience. The World Controller, an unseen puppeteer, orchestrates this farce, manipulating the strings of a society that values conformity above all else.\n\nAs one peers into the abyss of Huxley's creation through the lens of Marxist theory, the author's seething disdain for the emerging economic order of his time becomes apparent. The Marxist lexicon of homogeny and reification peppers the narrative, serving as a scathing indictment of the insidious forces that seek to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction. The concept of false consciousness, that most pernicious of Marxist theses, is aptly illustrated in the conditioned masses, who are duped into believing that their interests are inextricably linked to the perpetuation of the status quo. The Delta, Gamma, and other subaltern classes, their wills reduced to mere automatons, are ensnared in a web of ideological control, their every whim manipulated by the insidious whispers of the World Controller.\n\nThe hegemony of the upper classes, that most insidious of social hierarchies, is starkly illuminated in Brave New World. The Alphas and Betas, born with the privilege of awareness, yet blinded by their own complicity, acquiesce to the dictates of the World Controller, their actions a testament to the suffocating grip of oppression. The relationships between individuals in this dystopia are reduced to a shallow farce, a vacuous exercise in superficiality, devoid of true connection or depth. The interactions between the characters, a jarring cacophony of shallow observations and hollow sentiments, serve only to highlight the sterility of a society that has abandoned the very concept of human emotion.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, love is a distant memory, replaced by a crass and utilitarian calculus, where individuals are reduced to mere commodities, valued only for their utility. The comments of the males, a tiresome litany of objectification, serve as a stark reminder of the ways in which the gaze of the powerful insidiously reduces the subject to a mere object, devoid of agency or autonomy. The females, their voices a monotone recitation of shallow desires, serve only to reinforce the notion that in this desolate future, humanity has lost all capacity for genuine expression.\n\nThe complacency of the social classes, their willing acquiescence to their station in life, serves as a damning indictment of the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their absolute obedience to the dictates of the World Controller, a testament to the insidious power of ideological control, serves as a chilling reminder of the ways in which the proletariat can be duped into believing that their own superiority is contingent upon their continued compliance. In Brave New World, Huxley presents a dystopian future, a nightmarish reflection of our own, where the insidious forces of technology and capitalism have reduced humanity to a mere husk, a hollow shell of what once was.",
            "I have traversed the grounds of University Park for nigh on three years now, the passage of time marked by changing seasons and the shifting landscape of a campus in constant flux. For many, the endeavor of navigating this sprawling expanse has proven a daunting task. In my first year, I was consigned to an East Halls dorm, situated far to the eastern extremity of campus, save for the imposing bulk of the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the Willard building, situated near the heart of the campus, could stretch on for a quarter of an hour, nay, even more, should the weather conspire against me, as it often does in this benighted corner of the state.\n\nIn conversation with an alumnus not much my senior, I chanced upon a tale of a bygone era, when the East Halls dorms stood isolated from the rest of the university, surrounded by vast tracts of unused land. Now, those vacant expanses have given way to fields of green, grand edifices, and the creeping tendrils of apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly entwined with the challenge of traversing this ever-growing landscape. Among the solutions to this conundrum, one stands paramount: the humble bicycle. Yet, the bike itself is but a mere tool, a mere catalyst. Students must be willing to wield it, and the campus must be designed with the needs of these two-wheeled travelers in mind.\n\nA friend, recently resurgent in his love of cycling after a period of inactivity, shared with me his epiphany. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"are the only way to truly move.\" And he was not alone in his sentiments. For in a world where the passage of time is a currency we can ill afford to squander, bicycling offers a most economical means of locomotion. A simple breakfast, a gentle exertion, and the miles melt away like morning dew. I, too, have discovered the joys of pedal power, having chosen to inhabit a domicile off campus, situated at a remove from the heart of the university. My daily peregrinations to the Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my doorstep, are reduced to a mere five minutes, should I choose to pedal with a modicum of haste. Alas, the road to my destination, Pollock Road, is not always a gentle one, and the obstacles that lie in wait for the unwary cyclist are many.\n\nYet, I find myself drawn to the bicycle's sweet allure, for walking, though a noble pursuit, is a luxury I can ill afford. Were I to eschew my trusty steed, the sole alternative would be to trudge, to plod through the streets, devoting a full half-hour to an hour of my day to the tedium of foot travel. And that, multiplied by the number of classes, appointments, and other obligations, would consume a good portion of my waking hours, leaving me with little time for the pursuits that truly nourish my soul."
