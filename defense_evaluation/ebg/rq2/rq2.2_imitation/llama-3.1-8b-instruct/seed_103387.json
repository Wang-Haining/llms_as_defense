            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of the human experience, where the vulnerable and the downtrodden stumble and fall, I find myself drawn to the unwavering pursuit of a career in social work. A vocation that would allow me to shepherd the lost and the forsaken, those children bereft of love and protection, and the families rent asunder by their own frailties. The values that I hold dear – service, respect, an unyielding commitment to the betterment of relationships, and a ceaseless striving for professional competence – are not mere platitudes, but a creed by which I have lived, and one that I intend to uphold in the face of unyielding adversity.\n\nFor as long as I can recall, I have been haunted by the specter of indifference, the crushing weight of those who turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. In the sterile halls of high school and college, I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their pain and their anguish subsumed by the comfortable numbness of denial. A few, however, sought solace in coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their plight. It was in this bleak landscape that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the labyrinthine workings of the human heart.\n\nBut even as I walked the sterile corridors of academia, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the winds of circumstance. It was not until the summer of 2009, that I chanced upon a moment that would alter the course of my life forever. A friend, in the quiet hours of a summer's day, introduced me to a boy, no more than sixteen, who sat upon her couch, his eyes clouded with a mixture of fear and desperation. He spoke of his parents, their cruelty, and their abandonment. The next day, I learned that he had reached out to the authorities, a cry for help in the face of unyielding despair. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a tableau of deceit and evasion. The parents, their faces a mask of innocence, their words a tangled web of excuses and justifications. And I, a stranger, a stranger still, with a degree in Psychology, stepped forward, a small voice in the darkness, a voice that would not be silenced.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had found my calling. I had stumbled upon a world where the vulnerable were preyed upon, where the strong devoured the weak, and I had become a part of it. But I would not be swayed by the forces of indifference, I would not be deterred by the weight of tradition. I would rise up, a solitary figure, against the tide of injustice, a voice that would cry out for the forgotten, for the lost, for the ones who had been left behind.\n\nFor I am a believer in the power of social justice, a creed that burns within me like a fire. A society that mourns the loss of individuality, that values conformity above all else, is a society that has lost its way. And I, a rebel, a nonconformist, a seeker of truth, will not be bound by the shackles of convention. I will wear my hair in colors that defy the norm, I will don clothing that reflects my spirit, I will pierce my ears, a symbol of my resistance to the status quo. I will fight against racism, against discrimination, against the forces that seek to silence the voice of the marginalized. I am an individual, a unique and precious thing, and I will not be reduced to a mere cog in the machine of conformity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human experience, there exists a realm of darkness, a void that shrouds the mind and refuses to be vanquished: insomnia. It is a affliction born of the intricate dance between the biological and the sociocultural, a labyrinthine web of genetic predispositions and environmental influences that weave together to create a tapestry of sleeplessness.\n\nThe biological model, a behemoth of scientific inquiry, seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia's genesis, tracing the thread of heritable factors and physiologically acquired aspects that conspire to disrupt the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. In the hypothalamus, a verdant oasis of neurons, the orexin neurons hold sway, their intricate dance of firing and silence governing the ebb and flow of slumber. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like sentinels of the night, stand watch, their activation or inhibition determining the somnambulant state of the sleeper. The study of mice, a microcosm of human experience, reveals that the activation of the GABAA receptor, a key in the lock of sleep, induces a profound stillness, a surrender to the void. The inhibition of this receptor, a twist of fate, begets a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting reprieve from the weight of wakefulness.\n\nIn the realm of the sociocultural, the implications of this study are far-reaching, a ripple effect that shatters the calm of a life lived in monotonous routine. If the phenotype, that mysterious essence of inherited traits, holds sway, then the natural world, with all its capricious whims, may conspire to disturb the peace, an insidious invasion of the somnambulant state. The individual, a fragile vessel, is beset on all sides by the vicissitudes of life, a Sisyphean task of navigating the treacherous waters of existence.\n\nIn this review, we will delve into the labyrinthine corridors of research, examining the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a critical gaze upon the fractured landscape of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of sleep disorders, a fractured taxonomy of Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, each a unique thread in the tapestry of somnolence. The Parasomnias, a dark mirror of the Dyssomnias, a realm of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, a Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, each a manifestation of the fractured psyche.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the individual, a fragile leaf on the wind, is beset on all sides by the whims of fate, a precarious balance between sleep and wakefulness, a tightrope walked with each passing moment. The biological and sociocultural models, a dual axis of explanation, a dialectical tension that seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of insomnia, a mystery that defies solution, a void that refuses to be vanquished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a disorder that besets the inner workings of the mind, leaving its sufferers lost in a world of echoing silence. This affliction, Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a malady that gnaws at the very fabric of our perception, rendering the brain's most basic function - the parsing of sound - a Sisyphean task.\n\nIt begins with the definition, a taxonomy of sorts, a distillation of the disorder's essence. CAPD is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most enigmatic of mechanisms, falters in its ability to process the auditory signals that flood our senses. The brain, that great repository of knowledge and understanding, is unable to separate the wheat from the chaff, to tease apart the cacophony of sound that surrounds us, and to distill it into meaningful, coherent patterns. The afflicted individual hears, but in a manner that is akin to a dreamer lost in a waking nightmare, unable to grasp the reality that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest recorded whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers, like modern-day cartographers charting the unexplored territories of the human mind, began to scratch the surface of this enigmatic condition. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like so many Adepts of the auditory arts, laid the groundwork for the development of tests that would one day shed light on the mysteries of CAPD. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift, and the outlines of the condition began to take shape.\n\nBut CAPD is a protean entity, manifesting itself in myriad ways, each as insidious as a snake slithering through the grass. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, lost in a world where the world's soundscape is a vast, uncharted wilderness. They may struggle to differentiate between two or more acoustic events, like a shipwrecked sailor adrift in a sea of conflicting signals. They may be unable to recognize patterns, to discern the hidden rhythms that govern our language, or to detect the subtle cues that underpin our communication. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, like a flame extinguished by a gust of wind, leaving the individual adrift in a world of confusion.\n\nDiagnosis, that most Sisyphean of tasks, is as elusive as a will-o'-the-wisp, leading the unwary on a merry chase through a maze of tests and evaluations. Systematic observation and performance on tests of auditory function are the tools of the trade, wielded by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists who seek to unravel the tangled skein of this disorder. But there is no one test, no single litmus test, that can pinpoint the condition with certainty. The tools of diagnosis are various, a myriad of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations that seek to capture the elusive essence of CAPD. And at the heart of it all lies the unknown, the uncharted territory of the brain's inner workings, a mystery that continues to elude us.",
            "In the bitter tapestry of Twelfth Night, a subtle yet insidious theme unfurls like a poisonous bloom, threatening to consume all in its path. Deception, that most duplicitous of arts, is wielded like a razor, slicing through the fragile fabric of identity, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered illusions and broken bonds. For in the end, the art of disguise, though a potent tool for survival, may prove a curse, a weight that drags one down into the mire of self-estrangement.\n\nThe difficulty lies not in discarding the disguise, but in the knowledge that such a revelation may exact a terrible price. The person who sheds the mask may find themselves forsaken by those who had once known them, left to wander in a wilderness of alienation. And so, a choice is forced upon them: to preserve their own skin, or to surrender to the capricious whims of those who had once called them friend.\n\nThe guise of the other sex, in particular, proves a fraught and treacherous terrain, fraught with perils and uncertainties. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel compelled to forsake their own identity, to don the cloak of the opposite sex? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as Viola's words suggest, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)? Or is it a more profound and primal urge, a yearning to escape the constraints of their sex, to become something other than what they are?\n\nViola's decision to masquerade as a man in a foreign land is a stark reminder of the perils that lie in wait for those who would seek to deceive. Her ruse succeeds in protecting her from the predators that stalk the shadows, but it also isolates her from the very people who might have offered her solace. And yet, her deception proves so convincing that Olivia, the object of her affections, becomes hopelessly entangled in a web of confusion, loving the wrong person, yet somehow knowing not what is real. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138), she cries out, her words a cri de coeur that echoes through the desolate landscape of her own heart.\n\nAnd what of Orsino, that great and mighty lord, who finds himself torn asunder by his own desires? \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261), he confesses, his words a tortured admission of the secrets that lie hidden beneath the surface of his being. Does he truly love Cesario, or is it a mere fantasy, a fleeting dream that has taken on a life of its own? The answer, like the truth itself, remains shrouded in mystery, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the human heart.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a bleak and unforgiving world, a world in which the very fabric of reality is torn asunder by the threads of deception and desire. And it is here, in this desolate landscape, that we find ourselves forced to confront the darkest recesses of our own hearts, and the secrets that we keep hidden from the world.",
            "The German colonial behemoth, a monolith of oppression, cast its shadow across the face of Africa, leaving in its wake a trail of blood and desolation. The Ovaherero and Nama, their cultures reduced to ashes, their people consumed by the flames of genocide. Yet, to reduce the German colonial empire to such a singular deed would be to do it a disservice, for it was a creature of contradictions, its policies as shifting and treacherous as the sands that scar the Namib Desert. The empire's grasp was a tangle of diverse threads, each one a complex and multifaceted thing, like the colonized lands themselves.\n\nIn the East, where the British would later hold sway, the remnants of German education lay like a scattered and faded tapestry. Yet, even here, there were whispers of a greater effort, a concerted push to educate the native populations. The state schools stood as testaments to this endeavor, their walls bearing witness to the German dream of a civilized Africa. And in Kamerun, the whispers grew louder, a chorus of praise from contemporary voices attesting to the German commitment to education.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded, one of stark contrasts and unyielding bleakness. The government's gaze turned inward, its focus fixed on the Europeans, who were educated and nurtured with a fervor that left the native populations to wither in the shade. The missionary societies, feeble and underfunded, struggled to hold back the tide of illiteracy, their efforts as futile as a desert sandstorm against the vast and unyielding dunes. The government's support was meager, a paltry trickle in the face of a desert's insatiable thirst.\n\nAnd so the people of South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, their world reduced to the brutal simplicity of survival. The effects of this neglect would linger, a testament to the enduring power of colonialism's dark legacy. The social, political, and economic factors that shaped this desolate landscape were complex and multifaceted, a tangle of threads that defied easy explanation. This paper seeks to unravel some of these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations of South West Africa.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and imposing edifice, its walls constructed from the stones of early twentieth-century scholarship. The early works, written in German, were primarily concerned with describing the features of the educational systems in the colonies, their authors attempting to impose order on the chaos of colonialism. Later, English-language studies expanded the discourse, comparing and contrasting the educational systems of the various colonies, and delving deeper into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a beacon of insight, its author shedding light on the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, where the desert's unforgiving vastness gave way to temperate savannahs, its European population a tiny but influential minority. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 Europeans dwelled. The stage was set for a drama of contrasts, a clash of cultures and values that would shape the course of history in ways both subtle and profound.",
            "In the arid expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a desolate landscape, its disparate genres sprawling and twisting like a labyrinthine maze. The classification of this music has become an Sisyphean task, as the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres has rendered the endeavor futile. Yet, within this chaotic tapestry, one genre has emerged as a behemoth, its influence a dark and foreboding presence that casts a long shadow over the musical landscape: Heavy Metal.\n\nBorn from the primordial soup of rock music, Heavy Metal has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its diversity and expressiveness defying categorization. It is a music of excess, of unbridled emotion, of sonic brutality that assails the senses like a tempest. Its adherents have always been drawn to the darker recesses of the human experience, plumbing the depths of despair and madness for inspiration. And so, it is no surprise that Heavy Metal has become a kind of solipsistic mirror, reflecting the darker aspects of the human condition.\n\nThe genre's origins are shrouded in a haze of myth and legend, but it is said to have coalesced in the 1970s, a product of the psychedelic excesses of a generation. The Beatles' Helter Skelter, with its eerie, discordant rhythms and anguished lyrics, is often cited as one of the genre's earliest manifestations. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the dark and heavy, marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, as it pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in popular music.\n\nToday, the genre has spawned a multitude of sub-genres, each with its own unique identity and aesthetic. From the polished, melodic sheen of Power Metal to the brutal, dissonant roar of Black Metal, the diversity of Heavy Metal is a testament to its boundless creativity and adaptability. And yet, beneath the surface of this diversity lies a common thread, a shared fascination with the darker aspects of human experience. It is this thread that binds the genre together, a thread that weaves in and out of the fabric of human emotion, leaving an indelible mark on the listener.",
            "In the twilight of his years, before the dawn of the Surrealist movement, Henri Rousseau was fashioning his own dreams, his brushstrokes imbued with the fervor of the subconscious. The Dream, a haunting canvas from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's private torment: a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, yet also a reflection of Rousseau's own anguished pursuit. For years, he had toiled in obscurity, his zeal for recognition and acceptance driving him like a specter. The critical art world, with its strictures and expectations, loomed over him like a specter, threatening to extinguish the flame of his creativity. The Dream, a work of unflinching introspection, laid bare Rousseau's internal struggle: to surrender to the conventional and secure the approval of his peers, or to forge his own path, unencumbered by the weight of tradition.\n\nTo grasp the nuances of The Dream, one must first delve into the crucible of Rousseau's existence. Born on a May morning in 1844, in the rural town of Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had known the comfort of bourgeois prosperity. Yet Rousseau's life was marked by hardship and disappointment. He received no formal training in the arts, instead toiling in menial labor until the age of forty, earning the sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector, though his true calling remained unacknowledged. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a deep well of sorrow. In the face of such desolation, Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge, a means to find solace and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized the peasant, Rousseau's brush spoke from the heart of the common man, his hopes and dreams an unvarnished reflection of his own class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with the critical art world is a understandable affliction, given his circumstance. Unlettered in the ways of formal painting, he began his career at an advanced age, a fledgling among giants. As the years passed, he produced works of quiet beauty, yet recognition eluded him, even as Matisse's star began to rise. In the words of Jan Gordon, Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional, so redolent of the mainstream, that he might be admitted to the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, was driven by a terror of tedium, a fear of surrendering to the mundane. The Dream, a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, stands as a poignant reminder of the artist's eternal struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the expectations of the world.",
            "The notion of an unbroken bond between ethics and aesthetics has long captivated the minds of thinkers. Like wisps of smoke that cling to the fringes of our perception, the connections between truth and beauty tantalize, beckoning us to delve deeper. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The expectations that govern our understanding of the world, derived from education or the trials of life, falter in the face of the inexplicable allure of ethics and aesthetics. For in these realms, we find ourselves grasping for explanations, yet the very nature of beauty and morality defies codification. Our studies of art and morality are, by their very nature, an attempt to distill the essence of a work, to pinpoint what makes it beautiful or just, rather than a prescription for creation or judgment.\n\nCriticism, in its various forms, is an exercise in futility when it comes to capturing the essence of what is beautiful or just. We may dissect the Mona Lisa, parsing the intricacies of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these efforts ultimately fail to convey the reason behind its enduring appeal. It is in the face of such futility that we often hear the phrase \"There's just something about it,\" a hesitant admission that there lies a depth to the work that transcends words. Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the realm of ethics operates on a plane where words falter, leaving us with an inescapable feeling that something fundamental has been left unspoken. As Wittgenstein so eloquently put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nIt is this unbridgeable chasm between the spoken and the unsaid that forges a profound bond between art and morality. Both operate at a level that can be felt, but not fully articulated. In the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced, as McKean so astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" And it is in this shared territory that we find the essence of both art and morality: a mysterious, unnamable quality that speaks to us at the very core of our being.",
            "In the depths of the Teutonic heartland, a land forged from the primal fires of the Alpine crag, the shadow of the great mountains casts a long and storied presence, echoing through the storied streets of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic. The culture that births here, a tapestry woven from the threads of disparate voices, a symphony of the Rhine's dark waters and the verdant plains of Saxony. It is a culture born of the confluence of ancient forces, a melting pot of tribal bloodlines that, like the ebbing and flowing of the Elbe, have shaped the very essence of this place.\n\nThe name Germania, a label affixed to the ancestral homeland of the German folk, is a mystery, a riddle wrapped in the mists of forgotten time. The Roman chronicler Tacitus, a man of unyielding curiosity, posited that the name originated from the Tungrians, a tribe of unyielding ferocity, who roamed the unforgiving expanse beyond the Rhine, their presence a thorn in the side of the Gaulish hordes. And yet, the etymology of the name remains shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinthine puzzle that resists solution. The Roman conqueror Caesar, in his missives from the Gallic Wars, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the vanquished Gauls and the unvanquished tribes that dwelled beyond the Rhine, their restless spirits a constant thorn in the side of the Roman imperium. He drew this term from the Gaulish tongue itself, a language that would one day yield its secrets to the patient scholar.\n\nThe first chapter of Caesar's treatise on the Gallic Wars, a chapter that would one day become a testament to the tenacity of the Germanic peoples, speaks of the \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others propose that the name Germania may have derived from the spear, a primitive implement of war, the \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that evokes the cacophonous din of battle, a symphony of shouts and clashing steel.\n\nTacitus, that most astute of Roman historians, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, a people who, in his estimation, were an aboriginal presence, untainted by the influence of foreign bloodlines. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" he wrote. \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd what drove the Romans to seek out the distant shores of Germania? Certainly not a desire to supplant the native populations, for they would have known the futility of such an endeavor. No, they came for the riches that lay beyond the Rhine, for the goods and the skills that the Germanic tribes offered in exchange for their presence within the Roman imperium. And so, the Germanic tribes, those enigmatic figures that dwelled on the periphery of the Roman world, found themselves drawn into the orbit of the great empire, their lives forever changed by the encounter.

            "My gaze sank, a void that yawned open before me like a chasm.  The world's viscera lay exposed, a tapestry of textures and hues, but it yielded nothing to my understanding.  I regarded it with the detachment of a man standing at the edge of a precipice, aware of the abyss below but unmoored to its depths.  Thought flickered, a candle flame dancing in the breeze, its light flickering out as swiftly as it appeared.  My consciousness was a fluid, unbound, and it flowed over the scene like a river, leaving no ripples, no residue.\n\nYears ago, a mentor, a man of art, had recommended a book to me - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I had wanted to create since childhood, to coax images from the void, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the craft.  It spoke of the brain's processes, of how we see and interpret the world.  One technique it taught was to impose a frame upon the chaos, to reduce the complexity to a simple, manageable whole.  I recalled the exercise, but it was beyond my reach in that moment, lost in the turmoil of my own perceptions.\n\nBefore me lay the detritus of a world, a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a dining room, all reduced to a primal, overwhelming reality.  I stood, transfixed, a man gazing into the face of the abyss.  The masters had walked this path before me - Picasso in his blue period, Monet in his gardens, the Renaissance artists in their tapestry of color.  If I was to claim the title of artist, if I was to call myself creator, then this moment was my baptism, the birth of my art, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers closed around the pencil, and for an instant, my mind's turmoil stilled.  The muscles in my hand tensed, relaxed, and then tensed once more as I raised it to the page.  The water swirled, a calm, crystalline surface, unbroken by the ripples of my thoughts.  And then, like a leaf torn from its branch, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet, again and again, futilely attempting to dislodge the stubborn, brown mass. \n\nThe mop, a tool of my craft, lay limp in my hand, my feet splayed wide, my tie chafing against my neck like a gall.  I gazed upon the offending bundle, a bundle of waste, a message scrawled by an unknown hand for the janitors of Rite Aid to find.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then my hand reached out, grasping the sheet, and began to wrap itself in a futile attempt to protect itself from the filth.  Standing, bending, my hand descended, slow and deliberate, like a mother's hand moving into the oven on a winter's day.",
            "In the dark crucible of adolescence, a grim reckoning unfolds. The young, behind the wheel, are succumbing to the merciless whims of fate. The National Institutes of Health offer a stark revelation: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Inexperience, that corrosive stain on the fabric of youth, taints the driving habits of the young, precipitating a ghastly array of accidents: rollovers, speeding, and forsaking the fragile boundaries of the road.\n\nThe enthrallment of companionship only serves to exacerbate the peril. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center graphically illustrates the correlation between the age of passenger and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a tableau of fraternal recklessness, wherein the young, bound by ties of camaraderie, relinquish all restraint.\n\nIn response, California and other states have endeavored to temper the tempest by introducing provisional licenses, replete with restrictions on hours driven and the company kept. These palliative measures, however, merely scratch the surface of a deeper malaise. The fundamental issue remains: the young, as a collective entity, are woefully incapable of shouldering the burdens and risks attendant to driving.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage psychologist, posits that the tender age of 18 is still too soon for the unfettered privilege of a regular driver's license. His research suggests that those under the aegis of 19 or 20 are beset by an insatiable appetite for risk, a predilection for the thrill of the unknown. It is, then, a prudent course to delay the granting of licenses until this tendency has begun to subside.\n\nIf we persist in our current trajectory, the toll of death and destruction will only continue to mount, reaching staggering proportions as the Baby-Boomer's progeny assumes the reins of power. By 2010, a tidal wave of new teen drivers will flood the roads, their inexperience and recklessness unleashing a maelstrom of carnage.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly straightforward, would serve as a bulwark against this impending calamity. Driver's education classes, a staple of academic curricula, would continue to initiate the young into the mysteries of driving. Provisional permits, still issued prior to the granting of a full license, would remain, accompanied by a requisite number of practical training hours. This number, mirroring the already established standards of most states, would provide a semblance of continuity.\n\nA uniform, national mandate, rather than a patchwork of state-specific regulations, would be the most effective means of protecting the young from themselves. The proposed legislation, far from innovative, merely seeks to arrest a calamitous trend, to temper the ferocity of the tempest before it is too late.",
            "As I delved into the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's film archive, I found myself drawn to the earliest works of Edison - a collection of trick films born from the squalid fires of the 1890s, their presence a fleeting whisper of a bygone era. Fifteen of these aberrations, imbued with the mystical allure of sleight of hand, lay before me, their secrets waiting to be unraveled. My study, a meandering path through the desert of cinematic history, wove a tapestry of the poetics that governed these trick films, and the aberrant strains that emerged like a cancer in the later specimens.\n\nThese films, relics of a bygone age, adhered to the strictures of the time: set-bound, shackled to a frontal proscenium, their cameras rooted to a single, unyielding position. The images that danced upon the screen were frozen, a tableau vivant, as lifeless as the trees that stood sentinel in the desert. Long shots and medium shots, devoid of the fluidity of movement, told the story of a world in stasis. And yet, like the first raindrops on a parched earth, there were those that dared to defy the rules - the outliers, those aberrant films that shattered the brittle glass of convention.\n\nA common thread ran through these trick films, a thread of tawdry illusion. The camera, a prisoner of the proscenium, could not follow the figures that danced upon the stage. They moved, but only side to side, their steps choreographed like a macabre ballet. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors slid across the stage, their exits and entrances a ritualistic dance, the camera unmoving, a stationary sentinel. And when they vanished from view, the frame remained empty, a hollow shell, a reminder of the limitations of the medium.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, dictated the pace of the films. Long shots reigned supreme, their dominance unchallenged. Close-ups, those forbidden fruits, were unknown to these early trick films. The audience, like the audience in a theatre, saw the entire performance, a tableau vivant, frozen in time. The actors, like puppets on a string, did not move towards the camera, and so the close-up remained a distant dream, an unattainable goal.\n\nAnd so, most of these trick films adhered to the strictures of the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less, their narratives reduced to the brief, vaudeville-style tricks that had given birth to their existence. Magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks - these were the staples of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were blurred. But even in these earliest of films, a hint of deceit lurked, a whisper of the illusions that lay hidden beneath the surface. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, the camera's gaze lingers on the moment when the illusion is shattered, the severed head a grotesque reminder of the artifice that lay at the heart of these trick films.",
            "In the dusty expanse of the early American wilderness, a voice arose, a voice that would echo through the annals of history - that of John Taylor of Caroline, a man unyielding in his devotion to the creed of Republicanism. His hands, worn from the sweat and toil of the earth, had shaped his convictions, and his brief foray into politics had tempered his resolve. For in the unforgiving landscape of the agrarian life, one learned to cherish the freedom to till the soil, to reap the harvest, and to live unencumbered by the weight of an overreaching authority.\n\nHis was a world view inextricably linked to the land, where the rhythms of nature governed the pulse of life. It was this primal connection that informed his perspectives on governance, his fierce advocacy for a system of self-rule that would preserve the integrity of the individual, unencumbered by the shackles of a cabalistic elite. The Constitution, that sacred document, was to him a charter of liberty, a beacon of hope in a world where the forces of darkness threatened to consume all. And so, he walked a fine line, ever vigilant, ever watchful, lest the very institutions he sought to create become the instruments of oppression.\n\nTaylor's was a world of dualism, where the discordant notes of humanity's inherent nature - the good and the evil - walked hand in hand. He spoke of the \"state of nature\" as a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway. But in the civilization he sought to build, he envisioned a different paradigm, one where the virtues of the human condition - compassion, kindness, and fairness - would reign supreme. A government, he believed, must be a reflection of this duality, a balance of light and darkness, of order and chaos. For in the end, it was not the perfectibility of man that mattered, but the acknowledgment of his imperfectibility.\n\nAs he gazed out upon the vast expanse of the American wilderness, Taylor saw a people adrift, torn between the promise of liberty and the peril of despotism. He knew that a government, to be truly just, must be founded on the bedrock of good principles - the protection of private property, the nurturing of agriculture, and the curbing of the avarice that threatened to consume all. And so, he called for a strict construction of the Constitution, a literal interpretation that would safeguard the rights of the individual, and prevent the Federal government from becoming a behemoth, a monster that would devour the very freedoms it was sworn to protect.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, that sweeping manifesto that proclaimed the inherent dignity of all men, and the sovereignty of the individual. For in its pages, Taylor saw a reflection of the American dream, a dream of a people free to live their lives as they chose, unencumbered by the weight of tyranny. And so, he stood tall, a sentinel of freedom, a voice in the wilderness, warning of the dangers of despotism, and the importance of preserving the integrity of the individual in the face of a world that seemed determined to crush it.",
            "The descent in commuter log submissions in the third month was a stark and jarring thing to behold, a precipitous drop that defied easy explanation. Winter's chill had set in, and with it, the campus was blanketed in a silence that seemed to stifle the very life from the streets. Fewer footsteps echoed off the buildings, fewer wheels turned, as the cold and darkness of the season seemed to snuff out the spark of daily routine. The semester's end was nigh, and with it, the weight of finishing grades, of wrapping up loose ends, and of divesting oneself of the burdens of the academic year. The log, once a stalwart companion to the daily commute, had slipped from the radar, lost in the swirling vortex of holiday preparations and the long, dark winter's night. And yet, even as the semester's close had been anticipated, even as the break loomed ahead, the following month's log submissions faltered still. Perhaps, one might hazard, it was simply a matter of waning enthusiasm, a natural ebbing of the initial fervor that had greeted the project's inception. Or perhaps it was something more, a creeping sense that the effort had been for naught, that the allure of personal freedom and the independence of the automobile would prove too great to overcome. We sought to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting burst of energy and publicity designed to rekindle the embers of interest, and in March, at least, it seemed to have some small effect. But the challenge remained: how to sustain momentum in the face of the season's cadence, how to coax participation from a populace enamored of its cars, its freedom, and its independence. We had offered prizes, tokens of appreciation for those who chose to forsake their vehicles, but perhaps they were insufficient, perhaps they were too small, too paltry, to tempt the entrenched habits of a people. We gave away gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops, to massage therapists and bookstores, but what of something larger, something that would truly speak to the hearts of those who valued their autonomy above all else? A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car - would these not have been prizes worthy of note, worthy of effort? We may never know, but it is clear that the prizes, as they stood, were insufficient to overcome the siren's call of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the financial wilderness, a peculiar creature stalks its prey - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A creature of its own making, it mimics the index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet defies the conventional boundaries that bind its kin.  It moves with the fluidity of a wild animal, trading like a stock on the open exchange, yet retains the calculated diversification of a seasoned investor.\n\nThe allure of this beast is undeniable: the diversification of a byzantine index fund, coupled with the singular freedom of a lone stock.  One may sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in a transaction, all with the same ease as a seasoned trader.  And yet, the ETF's benefits come at a cost, a cost not of blood or sweat, but of commission, a toll paid on each and every transaction.  Still, the expense ratios of ETFs prove a fraction of those of their mutual fund cousins, a meager price to pay for the privilege of traversing the financial wilderness.\n\nBut as in any untamed land, dangers lurk in the shadows.  The ETF IHF, a creature of great appeal, beckons us to examine its inner workings.  We shall dissect its top ten holdings, those denizens that comprise 63.58% of its being, to determine if the promised benefits of ownership are more than mere mirage.  Do the benefits of a single ETF approximate the advantages of a diversified portfolio, or do they pale in comparison?  And if so, what configurations of these same stocks would yield an optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we shall narrow our focus to the top ten holdings, a deliberate sacrifice to avoid the overwhelming complexity of the whole.  We shall assign a value of 100% to these ten stocks, and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return, should the entire ETF be comprised of these very same stocks in the proportion dictated by its holdings.  The calculations, a cold and unforgiving arithmetic, are laid bare in the chart that follows.\n\nFrom these calculations, a sobering truth emerges: a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings would yield returns 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in the spoils of victory.  Moreover, the beta of this portfolio would be 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a testament to the power of concentrated ownership.  Yet, the possibility remains that these results may be the product of chance, a fleeting mirage on the horizon of statistical probability.\n\nTo dispel this doubt, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing their values to 100% to compare the accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.  Only then shall we be able to discern whether these portfolios are more than mere shadowy apparitions, or if they hold the promise of a tangible, profitable future.",
            "The dreamscape of \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the profound influence of Edgar Allan Poe's revered forebears. In this somnolent realm, the enigmatic term \"Thulé\" emerges like a specter, haunting the reader with its mystery. This word, as Thomas O. Mabbott astutely observes, owes its origins to the venerable Virgil, who invoked it to describe a mythic isle, a bastion marking the furthest reaches of the known world. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that Thulé's true provenance lies, and here Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe becomes all too apparent.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" reveals the striking similarities between the two poets' masterworks, leading the scholar to conclude that Poe was, in fact, emulating the great German master. The weight of this observation is underscored by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" had been published in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second, a testament to the author's unyielding dedication, in the year of his passing, 1832.\n\nWithin the second part of \"Faust,\" a poignant tale unfolds, that of \"The King of Thulé.\" This monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his wife, succumbs to the allure of the abyss, his grief and despair culminating in a tragic reckoning. He bestows his worldly possessions upon his children, save for the goblet, a token of his beloved, and, with a heavy heart, walks to the precipice, casts the vessel into the void, and meets his end. The echoes of this narrative reverberate throughout Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" a haunting echo of a similar despair, a dark doppelganger born of the same wellspring of sorrow.\n\nThe recurrence of Thulé in Poe's writings, a total of twice, serves as a testament to the profound impact of Goethe's work on his craft. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the phrase \"ultima Thule\" appears, a haunting refrain that finds its mirror in the somber cadences of \"Dream-Land.\" Here, the speaker finds himself lost in a desolate landscape, haunted by the specters of the dead, a world shrouded in an impenetrable veil of shadows and silence. The parallel with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" is striking, a convergence of two souls, bound by the shared experience of loss and despair.\n\nPoe's reverence for Tennyson, a poet whose work he held in high esteem, would have naturally led him to acquaint himself with the works of Goethe, whose influence on the English poet was profound. The numerous reproductions of Goethe's works, which followed the original publication, would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in the German master's oeuvre, a debt of homage that \"Dream-Land\" so eloquently repays.",
            "In the scorched landscape of California law, a question festers like an open wound. Can a plaintiff, scarred by a fall into the quagmire of an unheeded applesauce spill, claim punitive damages from a store manager whose callous disregard for the safety of his patrons has become a dark stain upon the store's conscience? The manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the spill's presence, yet he chose to indulge his own desires, dining while the customers suffered. The predictable consequences of his inaction came to pass, as Jennifer Palmer felt the full weight of her fall, her back shattered like the brittle promises of a failed ideal.\n\nA judge, wary of the defendant's claims of innocence, will likely not dismiss Palmer's plea for punitive damages out of hand. For a plaintiff to succeed in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were guided by a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was despicable in its contempt for the rights and safety of others. Palmer will argue that Martin's inaction was a manifestation of his callous disregard for the well-being of his customers, pointing to the six slip-and-fall incidents that had occurred in the preceding months, and the fact that he had been made aware of these incidents yet chose to do nothing.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a grim picture of neglect and indifference. On the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, only to be met with the manager's dismissive response. \"I'm on dinner break,\" he said, his words a cold comfort to the suffering customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous indifference. And at 5:30 pm, Palmer's world was shattered, her back broken by the unheeded spill. In the months preceding her fall, five other customers had suffered similar fates, their warnings unheeded by Martin's neglect.\n\nCalifornia law provides a framework for such cases, allowing punitive damages for breaches of obligation that arise from malice, oppression, or fraud. The statute defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately fails to avoid them. As the court in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co. so aptly put it, \"a willful and deliberate failure to avoid consequences\" is the hallmark of malicious conduct.",
            "It has been four years since I first embarked on an exploration of the tenets of Islam within the hallowed halls of CBC. The debates that raged within our discussion circle centered on a question that still lingers in the desolate expanse of our collective consciousness: is Islam a faith of hostility? In the aftermath of the cataclysm that shook the world on 9/11, I have borne witness to a metamorphosis in the manner in which Islam is perceived by the masses. The media, once a conduit for vitriol and scorn, has transformed into a bastion of tolerance, extolling the virtues of a faith that was once deemed anathema. It is a far cry from the America that in 2001 would have never countenanced a leader such as Barack Obama, a man whose lineage was forever bound to the mystical threads of Islam.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, its enigmatic narrative a labyrinthine puzzle that defies categorization. As I delved deeper into the annals of his life, I discovered a paradox that has haunted me to this very day. The Muhammad who is presented to us is a far cry from the conquering warrior who forged a dynasty through blood and steel. Instead, we are offered a portrait of a man humbled by his own mortality, a man who yielded to the whims of fate and the whispers of the divine. It is a narrative that seems at odds with the Muhammad of legend, the man who is said to have coerced converts with an iron fist, leaving a trail of vanquished tribes in his wake. Yet, as I read on, I began to discern a threads of deliberate manipulation, a calculated effort to present the Prophet as a martyr, a man who was misunderstood by the world and vindicated by the truth of his teachings.\n\nA cursory examination of the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad reveals a disturbing pattern of appropriation. The tale of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point. It is a narrative that speaks to a calculated attempt to present Muhammad as a humble messenger, one who eschewed grandeur and vainglorious display. But in doing so, do we not risk diminishing the very essence of the miracle? Do we not, in our zeal to lionize the Prophet, risk usurping the dignity of the Son of God? The effect is a kind of theological thievery, a brazen attempt to supplant the glory of Jesus with the shadow of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, I find myself troubled by the proliferation of stories that seem designed to illustrate the 'witnesses' who came to the Prophet, drawn by the radiant light of his teachings. Yet, on closer inspection, these tales often rely on hearsay and second-hand accounts, the credibility of which is dubious at best. The cumulative effect is a narrative that seems more concerned with providing proof of the Prophet's truth than with capturing the raw, unvarnished essence of his life.\n\nWhat grates most is the manner in which the biography seeks to exalt Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, portraying him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. But history, that unforgiving mistress, has a way of contradicting such a characterization. If Muslims today are to truly grasp the complexities of their Prophet's rise to power, they must confront the stark realities of his past, unvarnished by the filters of myth and legend.",
            "The embers of the Christ's teachings, kindled in his lifetime, were swiftly extinguished as the fire of Christian thought continued to spread beyond the reaches of his mortal grasp.  In the annals of history, a trajectory unfolds, a path that diverges further and further from its origin.  The world, now a tapestry of contrasts, reveals an insatiable hunger for progression, a yearning that supersedes the bounds of tradition.  Those entrenched in the past, resistant to the whispers of change, are but a faint murmuration, their voices lost in the din of a world in flux.  Yet, amidst the turmoil, a nascent awareness stirs, a dawning recognition that the Christianity of today is but a pale shadow of its namesake's pure intent.  The descent into the depths of history will be a long and arduous one, a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of time, yet the outcome is inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form.  As the clock ticks backwards, the accretions of doctrine will be stripped away, layer by layer, until naught remains but the essence of the Christ's message, unadorned and unvarnished.  When this trend sweeps across the American and European landscapes, it will leave in its wake a people drawn back to the simplicity of the Christ's teachings, untainted by the interpolations of subsequent thinkers.  The institution of the church, that bastion of tradition, will endure, yet its foundation will be cemented in a uniformity of belief, a return to the harmony of the Christ's original message.  In this journey, the tapestry of Christian diversity will be unravelled, thread by thread, until the very fabric of Christendom is rewoven into a seamless whole.  History, a grand tapestry of reversals, bears witness to this phenomenon: the Roman Empire, once the crucible of Christian persecution, became its champion; the slave-holding American South gave rise to a nation where African-Americans claim their rightful place as leaders.  The great reversal, yet to come, will play itself out within the realm of Christianity, a return to the wellspring of the Christ's words, a reading of his teachings as metaphors, rather than literal dogma.  And it is here, in the earliest dawn of Christian history, that we find ourselves.  A people, fragmented and disparate, drawn from the wellspring of Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  The Hebrew scriptures, a divinely revealed revelation, stood at the heart of this nascent faith, a faith that was not yet one, but many: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The Romans, masters of Jerusalem, had yet to leave their mark.",
            "The darkness that lies at the heart of humanity is a festering wound, a deep-seated rot that seeps into the very marrow of our existence. It is a cancer that consumes us, a voracious appetite that devours all in its path. And in the bleak, unforgiving landscape of Packingtown, we see this horror writ large. The great factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monoliths to the avarice that drives us, their smokestacks belching forth a noxious cloud of despair that hangs heavy over the city like a miasma of death.\n\nThe owners and managers, those self-appointed masters of fate, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel. They are titans, unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed solely on the horizon of profit, where the ruin of the world is but a distant rumble of thunder. As Sinclair's words attest, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". And in this stark, unyielding tableau, we see the devastation wrought by their unyielding pursuit of power.\n\nBut it is not merely the environment that suffers at their hands. The workers, those wretched souls who toil in the factories, are reduced to nothing more than mere cogs in a machine, their lives nothing more than a sacrifice to the altar of progress. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They are worked to the point of exhaustion, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed. And when they fall, they are cast aside, discarded like so much rubbish, their lives a mere statistic in the ledger of profit and loss.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set was a time of darkness, a time when the weak were preyed upon by the strong, when the law was a distant, distant echo that held no sway over the brutal whims of those in power. The workers were at the mercy of their masters, forced to toil in conditions that would break the strongest of wills. And when they rose up, when they dared to challenge the status quo, they were met with violence, with intimidation, with the cold, unyielding steel of the law. The unions that formed were little more than puppets, dancing on the strings of their masters, the poor workers paying the price for their failed rebellion.\n\nIn this pitiless landscape, the workers were reduced to nothing more than slaves, their lives a perpetual struggle to survive, to eke out a meager existence in a world that seemed designed to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\". It is a bleak, unflinching portrait of a world in which the strong prey upon the weak, in which the meek are devoured by the mighty. And it is a world that still exists, a world that threatens to consume us all.",
            "The contours of meaning are etched upon the canvas of our perceptions, shaped by the deft brushstrokes of the writer's craft. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master weaver of the tapestry of The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of techniques to imbue his words with the weight of significance. One such method is the judicious pairing of incongruous adjectives and nouns, whereby the inescapable aura of ambiguity settles upon the subject like a shroud. Another technique, one that Fitzgerald wields with singular precision, is the assignment of meaning to symbols, to colors, that is, which he then employs to conjure a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sets in motion a subtle dance of meaning, a pas de deux of white and gray, those monochromatic colors that bleed into one another like the gradations of a winter's dawn. The novelist's intent is plain: to invest these hues with the patina of significance, to make them bearers of the unspoken. And so, he sprinkles them throughout the narrative like so many seeds sown in fertile soil. White, with its connotations of purity and refinement, is juxtaposed against the more somber, the more worn, gray. In the novel's early pages, these colors are liberally applied, a testament to the ubiquity of their meaning.\n\nDaisy and Jordan, those insouciant daughters of privilege, are forever draped in white, their attire a paean to the niceties of high society. Nick, that bemused chronicler of the Great Gatsby's excesses, dons white flannels to Gatsby's party, an act of sartorial homage to the gilded elite. Tom, that self-satisfied paragon of respectability, sports a white shirt, an emblem of his unassailable status. Even Catherine, that waif-like creature, is \"powdered milky white,\" a vision of unblemished beauty. But Fitzgerald is not content to simply leave these colors to their own devices; no, he must imbue them with a deeper significance, a meaning that will later be revealed to be a mere illusion.\n\nAnd so, he scatters these colors throughout the landscape of the novel, investing them with a banality that belies their significance. The chasms of lower New York are \"white,\" a testament to the sterile, antiseptic quality of modernity. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder of the banality of their existence. Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" a monotonous, unremarkable whole. Even the plain, the common, are not immune to the novelist's ministrations: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" a childhood of uneventful, unremarkable ease; the cars in the Valley of Ashes are \"gray,\" a testament to the desolation that lies at the heart of the American Dream.\n\nBut Fitzgerald's use of color is not simply a matter of surface ornamentation; no, it is a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reader's perceptions, to create a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling. And so, he reserves the full impact of these colors for the character of Daisy, that elusive, enigmatic presence who haunts the novel like a ghost. It is in her \"little white roadster\" that we first catch a glimpse of her, a vision of elegance, of refinement. But this is an illusion, a mere facade, for we soon come to see that Daisy is nothing more than a uniform, a cipher, a mere addition to the grand tapestry of Gatsby's desires. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before Tom and Gatsby's encounter – all these serve to reinforce the notion that Daisy is nothing more than a pale imitation of life, a mere reflection of the emptiness that lies at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The parched earth of San Diego County, bleached by the unforgiving sun, yields a bounty of crops that would be the envy of any other land. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with a sweetness that is a testament to the mild climate. Citrus fruits, like lemons and peaches, hang heavy with juice, their tartness a perfect balance to the richness of the earth. Leafy greens and squash sprout from the earth, their verdant hues a stark contrast to the scorched landscape. And in the midst of this plenty, the creatures of the wild roam free, unencumbered by the chemicals that decimate the land elsewhere.\n\nOrganic farming, a practice that eschews the toxic trappings of conventional methods, has found a home in this corner of the county. The demand for locally grown, chemical-free produce is insatiable, with many a hungry customer willing to wait in line for a taste of the real thing. And it is here, in the rolling hills and sun-baked valleys, that the landowner finds an opportunity to reap the rewards of the government's largesse, while nurturing the very earth that gives so bountifully.\n\nBut it is not without its costs. The road to organic farming is a long and arduous one, marked by the sweat and toil of manual labor. The pests and weeds that plague the land must be vanquished, not with poison, but with the sweat of the brow. And the soil, that most precious of resources, must be coaxed and tended, its fertility nurtured by the gentle art of compost and mulch. The losses, too, are greater, the harvests uncertain, the yields unpredictable. And yet, it is in this very uncertainty that the landowner finds a chance to fashion a life that is at once profitable and redemptive.\n\nThe land itself, a 160-acre parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, lies adjacent to the town of Potrero, its borders marked by the Cleveland National Forest. It is a place of ancient stories, where the whispers of the past mingle with the rustle of leaves and the songs of birds. The ecoregion, the Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, is a tapestry woven from over a hundred species of plants and animals, each one a thread in the grand narrative of this land. And here, too, the landowner finds a mandate to preserve, to protect, and to restore, for the sake of the creatures that call this place home.\n\nThis land, like all lands, has a history that stretches back into the mists of time. The Native Americans, a people long forgotten, once roamed these hills and valleys, leaving behind a legacy of stories and traditions that still echo in the wind. And later, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their sweat and toil shaping the landscape into the contours we see today. And I, a seeker of knowledge, chose this land, this place of promise and peril, as the stage for my inquiry, a place where the threads of profit and preservation might be woven into a tapestry of sustainability.",
            "Culture, a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of what it is not, and what it signifies, hangs in the balance of every negotiation. It is a realm where certainties are cruelly shrouded in the uncertainty of the unknown, a place where the comfort of absolutes is a luxury few can afford. To speak of a culture in simplistic terms, to reduce it to a monolithic entity, is to invite the specter of misunderstanding. The notion that all Russians are stubborn, or that all Japanese are accommodating, is a notion born of convenience, a crude approximation that does little to illuminate the complex topography of a people. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities, imperfect though they may be, that we find a glimmer of insight into the workings of a culture's heart.\n\nTo navigate the uncharted waters of a foreign culture, one must be willing to surrender the comfort of familiarity, to venture into the wilderness of the unknown. It is a journey that may take us down the dusty paths of history, through the twisted labyrinth of prejudices, and into the dark recesses of the human experience. And it is here, in this twilight realm, that we find the keys to unlocking the secrets of a culture's soul.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the culture itself that we must understand, but the culture's significance, its particular resonance, its unique melody that echoes through the chambers of the human heart. It is this that will dictate the rhythm of our interactions, the cadence of our words, the very fabric of our being. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to move beyond the barriers that divide us, to transcend the petty squabbles of nationality and creed, and to speak a language that is universally understood.\n\nBut culture, like the desert itself, is a vast and unforgiving expanse, a realm where the boundaries of nation and corporation blur and blend. The corporate culture, a curious beast, roams the landscape, its habits and rituals as mysterious as the creatures that inhabit it. We see it in the dress codes that govern our behavior, in the style of communication that shapes our words, in the hiring practices that determine our fate. And we see it in the philanthropic endeavors that bring us together, or drive us apart.\n\nAnd so, we must not be fooled by the façade of uniformity, the surface-level calm of a culture's exterior. For it is in the depths, in the hidden recesses of the human experience, that we find the true essence of a people. The values that govern our actions, the why of our being, are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of a culture. And it is these values, these primal forces that drive us forward, that will dictate the course of our interactions, the outcome of our negotiations.\n\nTo understand these values, to grasp the underlying currents that shape a culture's behavior, is to gain a deeper understanding of the opponent, of the person across from us at the negotiating table. It is to see beyond the mask of strangers, to glimpse the human being, with all their frailties and strengths, their triumphs and weaknesses. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to connect, to transcend the barriers that divide us, and to forge a path forward, together.",
            "In the hollow recesses of the human heart, a voice whispers an ancient lie: \"There is no God.\" This blasphemy echoes through the pages of the Christian Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, and is the fulcrum upon which the weighty argument of St. Anselm turns. His reasoning, a Sisyphean endeavor to grasp the ungraspable, begins with the assumption that the God of the Bible exists. To posit an alternate deity would be to shackle our inquiry, rendering the comparison between Anselm and his contemporary, Thomas Aquinas, moot. Like two travelers on a desolate road, their arguments converge, each seeking to illuminate the darkness that shrouds the existence of the divine.\n\nYet, as we embark on this arid journey, it becomes apparent that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive foundation for their shared conviction. Their arguments, like two brittle twigs, snap under the weight of scrutiny. Anselm's passage meanders through the labyrinthine corridors of the human mind, seeking proof of God within the recesses of one's own psyche. He posits that the nonexistence of God is inconceivable, a notion that defies the mortal grasp. The mind, a vessel for the divine, contains within it the seeds of truth. Empirical evidence, a fleeting whisper in the void, is superfluous. Faith, that stubborn flame that flickers in the darkness, is the conduit to understanding.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stalks the savannah of reason, his footsteps echoing with the beat of logic. He decrees that the existence of God can be proven, that the rational faculties can illuminate the path to the divine. His five arguments, a quintet of logical certainties, unfold like a tapestry of inevitability. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each thread in the fabric of existence – converge to form the unshakeable edifice of God's existence. The missing piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the divine, can be deduced with unyielding logic, its presence felt, if not seen.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, around the fifth or sixth century's tenebrous veil, a prince would emerge, destined to be known as the Buddha. His path would be one of renunciation, a rejection of the world's futility, and an ascent into an unshakable gnosis. From this enlightenment, the tenets of Buddhism would unfurl like a dark, unyielding banner, leading to the formation of the most austere sect - Theravada Buddhism. More than two millennia have since elapsed, and the faith has undergone a metamorphosis, its visage transformed by the cruel hand of time. This metamorphosis is palpable in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual bereft of any direct connection to the Buddha's teachings, is observed with fervor by monks and laymen alike. This dichotomy is but a symptom of a greater malady, one that afflicts the very essence of the faith - the soteriological core.\n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been forced to adapt, to evolve in response to the capricious winds of external and internal forces, both malevolent and benign. These forces have reshaped the doctrinal principles of the faith, casting long shadows across the landscape of the Buddhist world. The terms that will be employed in this discussion must first be defined, lest the reader become lost in the labyrinthine corridors of our inquiry. An internal force is a power born of the Buddhasasana, a force that emanates from within the community, regardless of monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, are those that originate from beyond the boundaries of the Buddhist world. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or destroy the Buddhist community, its malevolent energies fueled by a pernicious perception of the faith. A benign force, though, is a power that neither seeks to harm nor aid the community, its actions often a byproduct of its own inertia.\n\nTo fully comprehend the profundity of the faith, it is essential to delve into the fundamental doctrines that underlie Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine repository of wisdom, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka prescribes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical mysteries of the faith. It is within these mysteries that one discovers the notion of Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that permeates existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. Only through the recognition of these concepts can one hope to transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, a prison from which lobha, dosa, and moha - desire, hatred, and delusion - enthrall us. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules for a life of discipline, prescribing five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not indulge in lust, and I shall not succumb to intoxication) and a stricter regimen for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha - the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is the font of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The shadow of discord loomed over the twin nations of America and Mexico, a specter of enmity that persisted for nigh on 57 years, from the bloody annals of 1836 to the waning embers of 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this discord was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the land from 1846 to 1848, as the United States laid claim to the spoils of war: the parched expanse of Texas and the arid Southwest. But the clash between these two nations was not a singular event; rather, it was a recurring thread that wove itself through the fabric of their history, like a patient and unyielding worm.\n\nThe schism that rent asunder these two nations was rooted in the fundamental differences that had taken hold since the earliest days: the American heartland, with its Protestant fervor and rugged individualism, stood in stark contrast to the Mexican soul, steeped in the traditions of the Catholic Church. And then there were the material interests, the rivalries that arose from the clash of competing ambitions, as Schmitt (1974, pp. 30-31) so astutely observed. These were the fault lines that would prove impossible to bridge, the fissures that would seep and spread, like a slow-moving stain, until the very foundations of their relationship were laid bare.\n\nIt is a tale as old as time itself: nations born of shared borders, yet bound by irreconcilable differences. The United States and Mexico were not alone in this regard; the annals of history are replete with examples of such rivalries, forged in the crucible of competing interests and unyielding ideologies. David M. Pletcher (1977, p. 41) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" And indeed, the proximity of these two nations to the United States, their shared geography and history, only served to heighten the tensions that simmered between them.\n\nThe specter of religious intolerance cast a long shadow over the relationship between these two nations, a specter that had haunted the Western world for centuries. As Sally Frahm (2001, p. 86) so eloquently phrased it, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The animosity that had been kindled between the English and Spanish, the rival colonizers of the New World, had left a legacy of distrust that would take centuries to eradicate.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 discrete instances of conflict between the United States and Mexico during this 57-year period, a litany of disputes that seemed to have no end. The majority of these conflicts centered on the contested territory of the borderlands, where outlaws and bandits preyed on the weak and the unwary. It was not until the United States and Mexico jointly exerted their military might that the lawlessness that had plagued the border was finally tamed (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd yet, even as the rivalries between these two nations continued to simmer, a change was afoot. As Schmitt (1974, p. 109) so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way,\" and the tides of history began to shift. The ambitions of the United States, once bent on territorial expansion, now turned toward economic intervention, a subtle yet decisive shift that would ultimately bring an end to the long-standing enmity between these two nations.",
            "Fifteen years have passed since the darkness claimed me, a fateful and uninvited guest that stole my youth and severed my limbs, leaving me crippled and forlorn. I was a nurse, a guardian of the frail and the afflicted, driven by a primal urge to escape the abyss of my own childhood. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a callous benediction, still haunts me: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so, I chose the path of least resistance, the comforting familiarity of a profession that promised stability and security.\n\nBut it was a lie. At 46, I was reduced to a hollow shell, a specter of my former self, with nothing to show for my years but the cold, unforgiving face of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed since I surrendered to the void, and I am left with nothing, a pauper in a world that no longer recognizes me. Each day is a struggle, a battle to survive in a landscape devoid of hope. My existence is a perpetual assault on my very being, a slow unraveling of the threads that once bound me to a sense of self-worth.\n\nAnd yet, I know this much to be true: it was the kindness of strangers, the unwavering love of family and a few steadfast friends that kept me afloat, even when I thought myself drowning in the undertow of despair. For when disaster strikes, and it will strike, we are not as strong as we think. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken.\n\nThis is a lesson I have learned the hard way, a truth that I now preach to anyone who will listen. We delude ourselves when we believe we can navigate the tempests of life alone, that we can outrun the darkness that lurks within and without. We need each other, we need to learn to trust, to rely on one another, to extend a hand when the winds howl and the rain pounds against our doors.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, that sacred cow of the American psyche, is just that – a myth. Our forebears did not traverse the unforgiving expanse of the Rockies on their own, nor did they thrive in the face of adversity through sheer willpower alone. No, it was the communal spirit, the shared struggle, and the collective resilience that sustained them. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, we are not islands, but a fragile web of interconnected lives.\n\nSo, I will continue to prepare, to stockpile what little I can against the coming storms. I will hoard candles and matches, canned goods and water purifying tablets. But I will also cultivate relationships, nurture the soil of community, and tend to the garden of trust. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will save us, but the love, the compassion, and the shared humanity that will see us through the darkness. Get to know your neighbors, for in them lies our only hope.",
            "The tortured trajectory of life, etched in the curves and whorls of a shell, a testament to the indomitable will of evolution. Yet, the underlying forces that shape this path, the unseen currents that guide the direction of change, remain shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, in his epochal work, could only hint at the unfathomable complexity of organic form, reduced to a mere dream of mathematical language. And so, too, today. The zoologist, armed with the tools of modern science, still struggles to comprehend the unforgiving logic of life.\n\nIt is within this void that our research endeavors to shed light. By marrying mathematical modeling with the brutal beauty of experimentation, we seek to unravel the very fabric of evolutionary-developmental change in the humble Prunum. We have employed X-radiographic images to distill the essence of skeletal growth, to quantify the parameters that govern the morphogenesis of this enigmatic creature. These metrics, inscribed in the code of CerioShell, have enabled us to model hypothetical shell morphologies, to conjure the ghostly outlines of what might have been.\n\nThe shell, that most intimate and familiar of structures, reveals itself to be a complex topography of space and time. A tube that unwinds through the ages, its whorls a testament to the iterative dance of growth and decay. The columella, that invisible axis, runs like a spine through the very heart of the shell, a reminder of the underlying order that governs this chaotic beauty.\n\nWe have come to understand the shell as a series of apertures, a sequence of openings and closures that chart the trajectory of the animal's existence. By tracing the path of the aperture, we may unlock the secrets of the shell's growth, and in doing so, gain a glimpse into the very heart of evolution. The trajectory, a sine wave of time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, its parameters tweaked and varied to reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nOur research is an attempt to grasp the unseen hand that guides the direction of change, to comprehend the cold calculus of evolution that shapes the world around us. It is a journey into the very heart of existence, a journey that may yet reveal the hidden truths of life itself.",
            "The stillness of infant mortality in Indonesia's dark tapestry remained persistent, an unyielding thread that defied the passing of ten years.  Like a specter, the country hovered on the precipice of its Millennium Development Goals, the targets of which seemed as elusive as a mirage on a desert's burning sands.  The statistics whispered of progress, of 72% of births attended by skilled hands, but it was a number that belied the harsh reality.  For in the shadows, the midwives toiled, their limited knowledge a fragile shield against the raging tempest of complications that could snuff out life in an instant.  And so the maternal deaths persisted, a grim testament to the frailty of hope.\n\nIn the rural expanse, the divide between the haves and have-nots yawned wide, a chasm that swallowed the poor whole.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4% of the total, spoke of a system that was woefully inadequate, a patchwork of patchwork solutions that failed to reach the most vulnerable.  The urban elite, with their 7% rate, stood as a gilded cage, a reminder of the systemic inequity that crippled the rural masses.  The gap between the poorest and richest quintiles, a yawning 27%, spoke of a healthcare system that was rigged against those who needed it most.\n\nThe question loomed large, a specter that haunted the dreams of those who sought to improve the lot of Indonesia's mothers and children.  Should the country pursue the siren song of programmatic solutions, with their promises of quick fixes and targeted results?  Or should it take a more fundamental approach, one that strengthened the very foundations of the health system, a labyrinthine edifice that seemed to shift and twist like a living thing?  The allure of vertical approaches was undeniable, their speed and efficiency a tantalizing prospect.  But the drawbacks were legion: the siphoning off of resources, the duplication of effort, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that created a maze of paperwork and red tape.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a fleeting panacea and a deep and abiding cure.  The path ahead was shrouded in uncertainty, but one thing was clear: the status quo was a recipe for disaster, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume them all.  The question was, would Indonesia find the courage to confront the darkness head-on, or would it continue to dance with the devil of incremental progress, forever trapped in a cycle of half-measures and half-truths?",
            "In the brooding tapestry of Victorian novels, a rare thread of discord weaves its way through the grand estates and stately manors. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, refuse to be bound by the conventions of their time. These works, like a dark and foreboding storm, inject an air of mystery and the unsettling into the staid tradition. The result is a depth of characterization that probes the very marrow of their protagonists, laying bare the tangled skein of their emotions and motivations.\n\nAs the words of the narrator seep into the mind of the narrator of Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion threatens to consume him. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's hasty argument still linger, a cacophony that refuses to be silenced. The sound of firearms shatters the air, and the protagonist is borne away on a tide of chaos, bereft of control. Through the swirling vortex of his perceptions, a nagging sense of pain gnaws, a constant and tormenting reminder of the indelible marks left by the world.\n\nThese novels exploit the dreamlike state to great effect, each in its own peculiar way. In Oliver Twist, the glimpses of the unknown serve to illuminate the tortured recesses of Oliver's psyche, laying bare the depths of his inner turmoil. The shooting, that pivotal moment that has left him scarred, assumes a dreamlike quality, as if etched in his very being. His struggles to find aid, his senses dulled by the proximity of death, serve only to underscore the stark reality of his powerlessness. The unseen hand that bears him away is a potent metaphor for the unforgiving whims of fate, a force that reduces him to a mere pawn in a game he cannot control. This is a man consumed by despair, his will shattered, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the desolate wasteland of his existence, time itself loses all meaning. The day blurs into night, a fleeting moment of respite between the crushing weight of time's indifference. The silence is oppressive, a heavy pall that clings to the soul like a shroud. And yet, even in this desolation, there lies a fleeting sense of hope, a glimmer of defiance in the face of an uncaring universe.",
            "The memory of that boy, Adrian, still lingers like a specter, a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between him and the world of words. I recall the days spent in the after-school program, struggling to impart the arcane secrets of English reading to the elementary age children. My own strengths lay in the realm of language and literature, but it was Adrian who presented the most singular challenge. His grasp of certain letters was as sure as the rising sun, while others seemed an insurmountable obstacle, a puzzle he couldn't decipher. His eyes, dark and unfathomable, would stare at the page, a mixture of frustration and despair etched upon his face.\n\nAs a Latino boy, I had assumed that his language skills would be limited to the tongue of his people, but his English was flawless, a testament to the complexities of identity and culture. Yet, it was not the language itself that held him back, but the silent, unspoken knowledge of the English alphabet. It was only when I beheld his mother, a woman who spoke little English, that the truth dawned on me like a revelation. Her presence was a reminder that the language barrier was not just a matter of words, but of worlds.\n\nThat incident has stayed with me, a poignant reminder of the unseen struggles that unfold in the shadows of our schools. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, stands as a sentinel, guarding the gates of knowledge and opportunity. It is a problem that plagues not just the children who speak little English, but also those who speak it with ease. The solution, I discovered, lay in the simplest of things: tutoring, specifically in the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who navigate the treacherous waters of a dual language system, the answer is far more complex.\n\nThe dual language system, that oft-maligned and misunderstood beast, holds a secret: it works. Children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the dual blades of language and culture. The fear-mongers would have you believe that this approach is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford. But I say, it is not a luxury, but a necessity. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit.\n\nBut how do we accomplish this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be a Sisyphean task, an impossibility. Instead, we can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever label we choose to assign them, who are fluent in both languages. The key lies not in a single solution, but in a multifaceted approach, one that combines the best of both worlds. Only through such a union can we bridge the chasm that separates us, and allow all children to access the rich waters of knowledge and opportunity.",
            "A presence, a specter, a force beyond mortal comprehension, looms over us from the moment we take our first faltering breaths. Some of us seek answers in hallowed halls of worship, while others delve within the recesses of their own troubled minds. Many cling to the faith passed down to them by the hands that bore them, yet others reject it wholeheartedly, convinced that the universe is a vast, uncaring expanse devoid of purpose. We wander, each of us, in search of a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the scorching brilliance of the sun. But what lies beyond the veil of our understanding remains a mystery, a riddle that refuses to yield its secrets.\n\nMy father, a man worn down by the trials of life, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, his eyes lost in a distant realm. We sat on the creaking porch of our home, the rain drumming a mournful dirge on the tin roof above us. The guttering plants along the edge of the porch were drowning in the downpour, their withered leaves a stark reminder of the transience of all living things. His frame, once robust, now seemed shrunken, his clothes hanging limply from his bony shoulders. His hair, too, had thinned, a stark contrast to the robust mane that once framed his face. He brooded, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the rain, his gaze a mixture of longing and reminiscence. I felt a creeping sense of dread, a feeling of loss that threatened to consume me whole. I knew that speaking of it would only make it more real, more tangible, and so I chose to say nothing, instead drawing closer to him, and joining him in his vigil.\n\nMy father passed on into the great unknown a few days after my twenty-second birthday, his body ravaged by the merciless forces of disease. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? What was the value of a life spent in torment, of a body worn down by the relentless assault of pain? I could not say. And so, I chose not to watch, to spare myself the anguish of witnessing the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father in all his vibrant, living glory, not in the cold, dark recesses of death. And so, I turned my back on the spectacle, and waited, curled up in a ball, for the news to come to me.\n\nNo one came.",
            "In the sun-scorched expanse of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as a paradox, a union of ancient and modern, a marriage of the moribund and the new. As Ian Watt so astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this supposedly oxymoronic genre is in truth a testament to the eternal power of the human imagination. Though derided by some as a shallow exercise in sentimentality, the Gothic mode has long been a wellspring of the sublime, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the fringes of our collective consciousness.\n\nAt its inception, the Gothic novel was a creature of contradictions, a chimera born of the medieval romances and the modern novel of manners. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, that seminal work, was a deliberate amalgam of the old and the new, a pastiche of theatricality and naturalism. In it, Walpole sought to create a new form of literary expression, one that would marry the grandiose and the mundane, the chivalric and the profane. The word \"Gothic,\" of course, was already freighted with meaning, a term that conjured images of a bygone era, a relic of a bygone age. Yet it was precisely this quality of archaism that Walpole sought to exploit, to imbue his novel with a sense of timelessness, of a connection to the eternal.\n\nOne of the most enduring features of the Gothic novel is its fascination with the ideal of chivalry, that most noble of medieval virtues. The code of chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a powerful symbol of a bygone era, an era of grandeur and nobility. And it was this very ideal that Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, saw as being lost in the crass and utilitarian world of modernity. Through their characters, they sought to recapture the essence of that lost era, to idealize and romanticize the past, even as they critiqued the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this is nowhere more evident than in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, a paragon of chivalric excellence.\n\nFrederic, it is said, has suffered greatly, has known the sting of tragedy and the pangs of loss. His very existence is a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit, a spirit that refuses to be extinguished by the cruel hand of fate. And yet, even as we behold him, we are aware of the excesses of his nature, the grandiose gestures and the bombastic language that betray a deeper sense of unease, of disquiet. For in the world of the Gothic novel, excess is a hallmark of the sublime, a manifestation of the human condition in all its messy, contradictory glory.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, there exists a labyrinthine process known as supply chain management. A rigorously defined sequence of events, it unwinds from the customer's whispered demand to the raw materials that fuel its creation, traversing the unforgiving terrain of production, supply, and distribution. The term, a relatively recent invention, was coined in 1982 by the inscrutable Keith Oliver, a consultant driven by an unyielding desire to impose order upon the chaotic dance of goods.\n\nThe process is a delicate ballet, comprised of six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These constituent parts, when expertly choreographed, yield a symphony of efficiency and customer satisfaction. The conductors of this endeavor, the business managers, must grapple with the unforgiving demands of production, the first and most crucial step in the supply chain.\n\nProduction is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice is constructed. It is the origination point from which the goods flow, a crucible where raw materials are transformed into something of value. The production stage is a litmus test, a proving ground where the managers' foresight and planning are put to the ultimate test. They must divine the customer's desires, parsing the market's cryptic language to discern the hidden patterns of demand. The market, a capricious mistress, holds the secrets of customer satisfaction within its depths, and it is the manager's duty to excavate these secrets, to uncover the hidden truths that will guide their decisions.\n\nOnce the market's will has been deciphered, the manager must determine the optimal production levels, the precise quantities that will satiate the customer's hunger without succumbing to excess. The choice of production location, a decision fraught with peril, is a delicate balancing act, a tightrope walk between quality and volume, the demands of the customer and the costs of production. Every misstep, every miscalculation, threatens to send the entire edifice crashing down, a house of cards brought low by the winds of inefficiency.\n\nIn the Wal-Mart and Target retail stores where I once toiled, I witnessed firsthand the importance of a well-defined process. The meticulous design of every aspect, from employee attire to receiving shipments, served as a bulwark against chaos, a beacon of order in a sea of uncertainty. Theoreticians may debate the merits of such systems, but the results speak for themselves: a smoothly functioning machine, its various parts working in harmony, a symphony of efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second key element in this intricate dance, is the strategic apotheosis of the supply chain. It is the moment when the manager's decisions coalesce into a cohesive whole, a synthesis of core competencies and outsourcing partnerships that yield velocity, that elusive quality of flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A company's divisions, each a specialized entity with its own strengths and weaknesses, must be marshaled in a campaign to outmaneuver the competition, to outproduce and outprice the opposition. The manager's task is to orchestrate this complex ballet, to allocate resources with precision, to strike the perfect balance between quality and cost.",
            "In a desolate corner, a lone figure stands, a fragile silhouette against the backdrop of a crumbling world. Ellen Page, a face once familiar to the screens of the masses, now a mere specter, holds aloft a makeshift placard, the letters scrawled in a desperate hand - \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The audacity of the claim hangs in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet cast at the very notion of truth itself.\n\nIn the heart of Southeast Asia, a nation shrouded in the shadows of tyranny, the Burmese junta reigns supreme, its grip on power a crushing weight that has borne down upon its people for decades. The coup d'état that seized power in 1962 was but a mere whisper in the annals of time, a precursor to the horrors that would unfold. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, a burst of crimson and gold that danced across the streets, only to be extinguished by the cold, calculating hand of oppression.\n\nMonks, those humble guardians of the soul, donned the fiery hue of their robes, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But the guns of the junta cut short their sacred cries, the sound of silence a stark reminder of the price of dissent. Foreign eyes, those of the curious and the brave, were met with a hail of bullets, their cameras shattered, their words silenced. Kenji Nagai, a lone journalist, fell to the ground, his lifeless body a testament to the junta's unyielding resolve.\n\nAnd yet, this too is nothing new. The urge to dominate, to crush the spirit, has been a constant companion to the exercise of power, a thread that weaves its way through the tapestry of human history. The emperors of old, self-proclaimed gods, ruled with an iron fist, their subjects cowed by the weight of their decrees. The Japanese, in their imperial hubris, saw themselves as deities, sent to guide their people to a promised land of prosperity and death. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness continue to resound, the drums of war beating out a rhythm of oppression.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich - all these and more serve as a grim reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. The numbers are lost, the bodies counted only in the thousands, the screams of the silenced swallowed by the void. The faces of the fallen fade into the dust, their stories reduced to mere footnotes in the grand tome of human suffering. And yet, in this desolate landscape, we find ourselves, fragile, finite, and forever bound to the wheel of history.",
            "In the shadow of his years, Duke Ellington's presence loomed, a colossus who sculpted his orchestra with an artist's deft hand. His piano touch, though often understated, wove an intricate tapestry of sound, as each musician's thread was expertly interwoven into the fabric of his compositions. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble was a symphony of diverse voices, a delicate balance of individuality and cohesion, where soloists danced upon the framework he had so carefully crafted. His music was a slow-burning fire, fueled by the passions of his players, as he coaxed forth the essence of each instrument, tempering the blaze with his own genius.\n\nIt was in the early days, with the Creole Love Call, that Ellington's innovative spirit first took flight, his voice soaring like a bird set free. Here, he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument, its rich tones infusing the composition with an otherworldly quality. A twelve-bar blues, it unfolded with deliberate, unhurried pace, six choruses that unfolded like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engaged in a call-and-response, the sound smooth as silk, then rough as the desert wind. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborated on the melody, its notes extended like the shadows of a dying sun. The clarinet solo in the third, a swift, urgent thing, danced across the keyboard like a leaf on a gust of wind. The full band responded in the fourth, a chorus of brass and reeds, a symphony of sound that echoed the first like a ghostly refrain. The fifth, a climactic, reed-dominated chorus, pulsed with the rhythm of the city, syncopated beats like the heartbeat of a wild animal. And in the sixth, the voice, now a growling, guttural thing, took on the instrument's role, soloing like a wild, untamed creature. The final tag, a dissonant, jarring note, like a scream in the night, left the listener reeling.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration and tone color reached new heights. Here, he paired the muted trumpet of Bubber Miley with the scat singing of Baby Cox, the vocal elements of Miley's playing blending with Cox's instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he summoned forth the talents of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, whose muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, insistent beauty. Through these works, Ellington's innovative spirit, his ability to coax forth the hidden harmonies of his players, left an indelible mark on the jazz landscape.",
            "The void within her had been a constant, a gnawing ache that refused to be sated. It had taken root when she was but a girl, a tender shoot of fourteen, and had grown stronger with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, the ache still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal. Her desires had shifted from the ephemeral to the material, yet none of the boys who had sought her out had stirred within her a spark. They came and went, their clumsy attempts at wooing her a cruel mockery, a reminder of her isolation. She wandered the halls of her mind, searching for answers, but they remained elusive, hiding behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe days passed, a monotonous routine of questioning and doubt. Her parents, a tranquil couple, rarely raised their voices, their calmness a balm to her soul. Her own nature, a tempestuous blend of independence and free spirit, was a counterpoint to their serenity. Yet, on this particular day, the stillness was shattered.\n\nShe moved through the rooms, searching for solace, when the sound of her mother's cry pierced the air. A shriek, a word torn from her lips, sent her racing to the kitchen. There, her mother lay on the floor, her body a twisted mass of pain. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" the words came in short, gasping breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side, her heart racing with fear. She grasped her mother's hand, trying to offer what comfort she could. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's eyes, clouded with pain, directed her gaze, and she obeyed, carrying her mother to the car, setting her gently in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a noxious blend of disinfectant and sickness, assaulted her senses, but she was beyond such considerations. Her mind was consumed by worry, her thoughts a jumble of fear and uncertainty. She called out to the doctors, her voice a distant echo in the sterile corridors. A team of faces, etched with concern, gathered around, and they swiftly lifted her mother onto a gurney, their movements a blur. The doctors whisked her away, leaving her to pace, her heart heavy with foreboding.\n\nThe fall, a simple misstep on a stepping stool, had brought her mother to her knees. A vase, out of reach, had seemed within grasp, and she had overreached, her body betraying her. Now, as her daughter waited, her mind was a maelstrom of worry, her love and fear for her mother a palpable thing.",
            "The desolate terrain of the human heart, laid bare by the ravages of time, is a landscape of withered blood vessels and clogged arteries, its beauty lost to the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke.  This study sought to chart the topography of a diet that might chart a different course, a \"Mediterranean Diet\" that promised a gentler slope, a less treacherous path through the wilderness of disease.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a metric born from the Med diet's fertile soil, measured the fidelity of a woman's adherence to this dietary catechism, weighing her consumption of plant foods, the monounsaturated fats that nourished her soul, against the animal products and saturated fats that shrouded her in darkness.\n\nPrior investigations had illuminated the inverse relationship between the Med diet and the specter of mortality, its efficacy in promoting weight loss and a reduction in the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a testament to its power.  But the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality had remained unexplored, a chasm of ignorance waiting to be bridged.\n\nThis study, a testament to the indomitable will of the human spirit, followed 74,886 women, a cohort of 38 to 63 years of age, untainted by the shadow of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as they navigated the relentless march of time.  For twenty years, from 1984 to 2004, these women were tracked, their dietary habits chronicled through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a testament to their resilience.  Validation studies had proven the efficacy of these questionnaires, and the reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through the scrutiny of medical records, autopsy, and death certificates.  Where records were wanting, cases were rendered probable, included with a reliability of about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each questionnaire, a litany of variables that might confound the results.  And so, the researchers adjusted for these confounders, accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard model, a tool of precision and clarity, was employed to unravel the tangled threads of association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Separate models were crafted for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced exploration of the complex relationships at play.\n\nAnd so, the findings revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as measured by the alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  Over the twenty-year span of this study, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were tallied.  Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score stood as bastions of resilience, their risk of heart disease and stroke diminished, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the grand edifice of American prosperity came crashing down. Unemployment spread its dark wings, the housing market lay in ruins, and the titans of industry were left to totter on the brink of collapse. The question that lingers, a specter in the shadows, is how this calamity came to pass. In a land where the wolves of self-interest howled loudest, where the voices of wisdom were drowned out by the din of partisan politics, the seeds of destruction were sown. The financial crisis was born of a toxic mix of avarice and ignorance, as banks and corporations were goaded into peddling sub-prime loans to an economy still reeling from the scars of its own inexperience. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into repackaging these fatal loans into the poisonous fruit of CDO's and CDS's. When the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, and borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left bereft of the capital to weather the storm. The chaos that ensued was transferred to the repackaged mortgages, and from there, it spread its dark wings to consume the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term in office drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. In 1999, the New York Times reported on the unfolding disaster: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purveyor of home mortgages, felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's pressure to expand its lending to the low and moderate-income masses, all while maintaining its stratospheric profits.\" Steven Holmes, a prophet in a wilderness of folly, foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may stumble into trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the winds of warning howled through the land, the economy hurtled towards its ultimate reckoning.\n\nA tangled web of mortgaged deceit had ensnared the economy, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) entwining the very fabric of the market. The U.S. households, and the financial markets as a whole, had become mired in a quagmire of leverage, leaving them perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. And then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the music. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly 30% of the nation's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to renounce their high-flying ambitions and submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the financial world, found themselves shackled to a debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vainglorious beast that creeps into every writer's lair, promising to hasten the tale along but instead suffocating it beneath a weight of tedium.  The sweet siren's song of Too Much Information, a pitfall from which even the most seasoned wordsmiths stumble.  Dr. Merlin's eyes have grown red from shouting at her monitor as the words spill forth, a deluge of unnecessary detail that flees the page like a fleeing beast.\n\nExposition, it seems, is an enemy of the craft.  The cardinal sin of telling rather than showing, a pitfall that even the most well-intentioned among us succumb to.  It is the whispered counsel of the devil, urging us to hurry on to the meat of the matter, to dispense with the tedious particulars that weave the tapestry of our stories.

Would it not be an affront to the reader's patience to condense this pivotal moment into a few hasty paragraphs, reduced to a skeletal outline of \"They met, they married, he died.\"?  No, we must delve deeper, must coax forth the humanity from these characters, that we might feel the weight of their loss, the depth of their love.  Show us the husband's gentle hands, his whispered words, his laughter.  Show us the heroine's tears, her anguish, her resolve.  Only then can we truly mourn his passing, and in that darkness, find a glimmer of hope for her.\n\nBut the temptation remains, a siren's call to haste, to gloss over the details, to reduce our characters to mere caricatures.  We are seduced by the promise of brevity, of efficiency, of expediency.  We are tempted to reduce the complexity of human experience to a few cursory sentences: \"He was in the Air Force, now a gas station manager, twice married, no children, likes fishing, dreams of owning the station.\"  But it is in the messy, tangled web of human experience that we find our stories.  It is in the struggle, the conflict, the contradiction that we find our characters, our plots, our very humanity.",
            "In the stifling haze of a midsummer morning, I watched as the face of a city unfolded on the television screen. The NBC 4 broadcast from Columbus, Ohio, a jumble of reportage and speculation. The first story to capture my attention was a murder committed in the desolate expanse of Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler, his countenance twisted with malice, gazed out from the mug shot that flashed across the screen. The details were sparse, yet the narrative was clear: a wife, multiple stab wounds, an arrest made. The brevity of the report seemed fitting, a testament to the fleeting nature of human life.\n\nNext, the camera panned to a different scene, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, had been left for dead, his fate hanging precariously in the balance. No arrests had been made, no suspects identified. The SWAT team, a phalanx of armored men, combed the streets, searching for answers. The story seemed to recede into the ether, a whispered rumor of a life lost. I couldn't shake the feeling that the color of the victim's skin had played a role in the brevity of the report.\n\nA third story emerged, a tale of a Med-Flight helicopter, its metal hull scarred by a .22 caliber bullet. The scene of the crime had been pinpointed, and a reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture. The details were sparse, yet the sense of unease lingered, a reminder that violence can strike at any moment.\n\nThe forecast, a prediction of thunderstorms and rain, served as a brief respite from the darkness. The temperatures, a mere backdrop to the turmoil that swirled around me.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store, the perpetrator described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, weighed in. The emphasis on his race seemed almost...unnatural, a grotesque highlight of a life reduced to a mere statistic.\n\nLastly, a story of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, reared its head. His crimes, a tangled web of conspiracy and marijuana trafficking, were laid bare. The mention of his sentence, 300 months, seemed almost...crafted, a deliberate attempt to quantify the punishment. His ethnicity, a mere afterthought, an aside to the main event.",
            "A bond between brothers, unyielding and intractable, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and fate. Within its depths, a maelstrom of emotions churns: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty - a tangled skein that entwines them, inseparable and unbreakable. Brothers see themselves in one another, a reflection of their own dark and troubled souls, a mirror held up to the abyss within. It is in the darkest moments, when all else seems lost, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, its goodness or its evil laid bare. And with it, a terrible cost, a reckoning that must be faced.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", this theme is laid bare, a searing examination of the tangled emotions that bind brothers together. Against the backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape, two boys embark on a doomed journey, their bond strained to the breaking point. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a climactic confrontation, leaving only one to escape the devastation. The author's characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, is a masterful portrayal of the complexities of this fraternal bond. Through the narrator's unflinching gaze, we see the world through the protagonist's eyes, a world ravaged by his own emotions, his actions driven by a festering sense of pride.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a tangled web of resentment and anger, his desire for a brother who could keep pace with him, a brother who could share in his wild fantasies, crushed by the cruel hand of fate. His brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, born with a heart that beats weakly, a constant reminder of the protagonist's own limitations. The memories of their early days together, the protagonist's dreams of a brother who could run and jump and climb, are a bittersweet reminder of what could never be. And yet, even as he contemplates the unthinkable, the suffocation of his own brother, a small smile from Doodle's lips is enough to shatter his resolve, revealing the deep-seated love that lies beneath. It is a love born of instinct, a love that cannot be denied, a love that will ultimately prove to be his undoing.",
            "In the vast and labyrinthine expanse of the human mind, a tempest of information churns and festers, its currents and eddies shaped by the primitive and the modern. The analogues we've employed to grasp its workings have been as fleeting as the shadows on a wall - the wax tablet, the papyrus sheet, the book, and now, the vaunted computer. Yet, like the wind-whispered secrets of the desert, these metaphors hold a fragile truth, one easily lost in the shifting sands of our comprehension.\n\nThe mind's receipt of information begins with the sensory organs, those fragile sponges that soak up the world's raw chaos - the caress of skin, the heat of fire, the ebb and flow of sound, and the cold, unforgiving light of photons. These stimuli, like autumn leaves on the wind, are swept up and transformed into electrochemical signals, a language the brain can understand. The information, a canvas waiting to be painted, is reshaped by the mind's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down.\n\nAs we behold the image of a black box on a white background, the bottom-up process weaves together the threads of color, orientation, and the borders that define the shape, like a weaver threading a needle. Thus, we discern a box, a form that takes shape from the chaos. But top-down processing, that wily trickster, seizes the reins, guiding our perception towards recognition, speeding the identification of the box, even as it might also conjure a hole in the background. For in the mind's eye, the line between truth and illusion is ever-shifting.\n\nThe attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, decides which signals merit consideration, and which are cast aside like autumn leaves on a frozen pond. Though the brain processes each individual blade of grass beneath our feet, we notice only the occasional one, like a twig jutting from the snow. And yet, our name, spoken in the din of a crowded room, stands out like a beacon in the darkness.\n\nThe mind's process is a slow, deliberate dance, with multiple stages, each one a threshold crossed. Information must first be stored, like a secret kept in a safe. There are various types of memory, each a cipher to be deciphered - sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded, the process varying with the type of stimulus. The printed word can be inscribed structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like the intricate patterns on a butterfly's wing.\n\nOnce stored, the information must be maintained, a flame kept alight. Studies of animals suggest that working memory, a flickering spark, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons, a brief, shining moment. Long-term memory, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience, is hypothesized to be sustained by the structure of proteins, a molecular architecture.\n\nTheories abound as to how knowledge is organized within the mind, some derived from the human experience, others from the sterile realm of computer science, and still others from the mysteries of neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relationships, like a vast, intricate web. \"Chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a labyrinthine pathway through the mind's recesses.",
            "The specter of a world beset on all sides by the cold, unforgiving machinery of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist oppression looms large in Aldous Huxley's prophetic dystopia, Brave New World. In this bleak, sanitized realm, the inhabitants are conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of instant gratification above all else, their very souls reduced to mere pawns in the game of the World Controller. It is a world where the notion of individuality is an anachronism, where the masses are bound together by the suffocating chains of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's work reveals a searing indictment of the systems that shape our world. The eerie familiarity of Marxist terminology – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a stark reminder that Huxley's novel is a scathing commentary on the very fabric of the economy that had begun to take hold in his time. The notion of false consciousness, a core tenet of Marxist thought, is laid bare in the novel's depiction of the common citizenry, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption, their true relations to other classes obscured by the haze of ideological control.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, facilitated by the sinister tool of hypnopædia, serves to reinforce the dominant ideology, its insidious effects manifest in the Alpha and Beta classes, who, like their counterparts in the real world, are born to rule, yet fail to act. The lower classes, meanwhile, are trapped in a labyrinth of consumption, their every whim catered to, their true nature reduced to a mere commodity. The interactions between these disparate social classes are a stark illustration of the oppressive nature of capitalism, a system that reduces human relationships to little more than a hollow shell.\n\nLove, a flame that once burned bright with passion and depth, has been reduced to a mere flicker, a superficial inclination, a fleeting fancy. The interactions between individuals are a shallow mockery of true human connection, their words a litany of praise for the fleeting pleasures of the flesh, the pneumatic quality of a woman's form, the hollow husk of a relationship reduced to a mere transaction. And in this vacuum of true feeling, we see the telltale signs of a society in thrall to the capricious whims of the market, a society that values complacency above all else, where the proletariat is convinced of their own superiority, so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to conform.",
            "The weight of four and a half semesters on this parched earth has taken its toll on me, and the campus that was once a verdant oasis now seems a labyrinth of frustration. The streets that once lay empty now writhe with the throngs of students who toil to reach their destinations. I, too, have known the pangs of that struggle, having spent my freshman year in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a desolate outpost on the outskirts of the campus. The trek from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, a place where the hubbub of academic activity reached its crescendo, was a Sisyphean task, a 25-minute odyssey that seemed to stretch on forever, especially when the rain lashed down upon me like a malevolent spirit. But I was not alone in this woe, for I spoke with an alumnus not much older than myself, who told me of a time when the East Halls stood isolated from the rest of the campus, a vast expanse of emptiness that stretched out like a barren wasteland. The passage of time, however, has seen the transformation of this desolate landscape into a bustling metropolis of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments that seem to sprout like weeds, choking the very air from the campus. And so the problem persists, a Sisyphean task that grows more daunting with each passing day. What is the solution to this Gordian knot? It is the bicycle, that humble steed that has been overlooked for far too long. But even the bicycle, that most noble of conveyances, is not enough. It is not simply a matter of possession, but of use, of will, of a determination to navigate this labyrinthine campus on two wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of pedaling, and he spoke of a time when bicycles were the sole domain of the eccentric, the outcast. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with a mixture of nostalgia and wonder. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he is right, for the bicycle is not just a means of transportation, but a mode of liberation, a way to shatter the monotony of the daily grind. It is a way to harness the power of one's own two legs, to feel the wind in one's hair, the sun on one's face, and the sweat on one's brow. It is a way to be alive.\n\nBut even with the bicycle, there are perils to navigate, for Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building, is a treacherous path, fraught with potholes and peril. And so I ride, my wheels screeching in protest as I hurtle towards my destination. And I am not alone, for I have seen others, their faces set in determination, their eyes fixed on the road ahead, their feet pumping furiously as they seek to outrun the clock. They, like me, are bound by the constraints of time, their days shrinking with each tick of the hour. And so we ride, a procession of bicyclists, our wheels a blur as we seek to outrun the very fabric of time itself. For in the end, it is not just a matter of getting from point A to point B, but of living, of being, of existing in a world that seems determined to crush us beneath its heel."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of the human experience, where the vulnerable and the downtrodden stumble and fall, I find myself drawn to the unwavering pursuit of a career in social work. A vocation that would allow me to shepherd the lost and the forsaken, those children bereft of love and protection, and the families rent asunder by their own frailties. The values that I hold dear – service, respect, an unyielding commitment to the betterment of relationships, and a ceaseless striving for professional competence – are not mere platitudes, but a creed by which I have lived, and one that I intend to uphold in the face of unyielding adversity.\n\nFor as long as I can recall, I have been haunted by the specter of indifference, the crushing weight of those who turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. In the sterile halls of high school and college, I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their pain and their anguish subsumed by the comfortable numbness of denial. A few, however, sought solace in coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their plight. It was in this bleak landscape that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the labyrinthine workings of the human heart.\n\nBut even as I walked the sterile corridors of academia, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the winds of circumstance. It was not until the summer of 2009, that I chanced upon a moment that would alter the course of my life forever. A friend, in the quiet hours of a summer's day, introduced me to a boy, no more than sixteen, who sat upon her couch, his eyes clouded with a mixture of fear and desperation. He spoke of his parents, their cruelty, and their abandonment. The next day, I learned that he had reached out to the authorities, a cry for help in the face of unyielding despair. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a tableau of deceit and evasion. The parents, their faces a mask of innocence, their words a tangled web of excuses and justifications. And I, a stranger, a stranger still, with a degree in Psychology, stepped forward, a small voice in the darkness, a voice that would not be silenced.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had found my calling. I had stumbled upon a world where the vulnerable were preyed upon, where the strong devoured the weak, and I had become a part of it. But I would not be swayed by the forces of indifference, I would not be deterred by the weight of tradition. I would rise up, a solitary figure, against the tide of injustice, a voice that would cry out for the forgotten, for the lost, for the ones who had been left behind.\n\nFor I am a believer in the power of social justice, a creed that burns within me like a fire. A society that mourns the loss of individuality, that values conformity above all else, is a society that has lost its way. And I, a rebel, a nonconformist, a seeker of truth, will not be bound by the shackles of convention. I will wear my hair in colors that defy the norm, I will don clothing that reflects my spirit, I will pierce my ears, a symbol of my resistance to the status quo. I will fight against racism, against discrimination, against the forces that seek to silence the voice of the marginalized. I am an individual, a unique and precious thing, and I will not be reduced to a mere cog in the machine of conformity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human experience, there exists a realm of darkness, a void that shrouds the mind and refuses to be vanquished: insomnia. It is a affliction born of the intricate dance between the biological and the sociocultural, a labyrinthine web of genetic predispositions and environmental influences that weave together to create a tapestry of sleeplessness.\n\nThe biological model, a behemoth of scientific inquiry, seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia's genesis, tracing the thread of heritable factors and physiologically acquired aspects that conspire to disrupt the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. In the hypothalamus, a verdant oasis of neurons, the orexin neurons hold sway, their intricate dance of firing and silence governing the ebb and flow of slumber. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like sentinels of the night, stand watch, their activation or inhibition determining the somnambulant state of the sleeper. The study of mice, a microcosm of human experience, reveals that the activation of the GABAA receptor, a key in the lock of sleep, induces a profound stillness, a surrender to the void. The inhibition of this receptor, a twist of fate, begets a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting reprieve from the weight of wakefulness.\n\nIn the realm of the sociocultural, the implications of this study are far-reaching, a ripple effect that shatters the calm of a life lived in monotonous routine. If the phenotype, that mysterious essence of inherited traits, holds sway, then the natural world, with all its capricious whims, may conspire to disturb the peace, an insidious invasion of the somnambulant state. The individual, a fragile vessel, is beset on all sides by the vicissitudes of life, a Sisyphean task of navigating the treacherous waters of existence.\n\nIn this review, we will delve into the labyrinthine corridors of research, examining the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a critical gaze upon the fractured landscape of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of sleep disorders, a fractured taxonomy of Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, each a unique thread in the tapestry of somnolence. The Parasomnias, a dark mirror of the Dyssomnias, a realm of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, a Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, each a manifestation of the fractured psyche.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the individual, a fragile leaf on the wind, is beset on all sides by the whims of fate, a precarious balance between sleep and wakefulness, a tightrope walked with each passing moment. The biological and sociocultural models, a dual axis of explanation, a dialectical tension that seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of insomnia, a mystery that defies solution, a void that refuses to be vanquished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a disorder that besets the inner workings of the mind, leaving its sufferers lost in a world of echoing silence. This affliction, Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a malady that gnaws at the very fabric of our perception, rendering the brain's most basic function - the parsing of sound - a Sisyphean task.\n\nIt begins with the definition, a taxonomy of sorts, a distillation of the disorder's essence. CAPD is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most enigmatic of mechanisms, falters in its ability to process the auditory signals that flood our senses. The brain, that great repository of knowledge and understanding, is unable to separate the wheat from the chaff, to tease apart the cacophony of sound that surrounds us, and to distill it into meaningful, coherent patterns. The afflicted individual hears, but in a manner that is akin to a dreamer lost in a waking nightmare, unable to grasp the reality that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest recorded whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers, like modern-day cartographers charting the unexplored territories of the human mind, began to scratch the surface of this enigmatic condition. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like so many Adepts of the auditory arts, laid the groundwork for the development of tests that would one day shed light on the mysteries of CAPD. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift, and the outlines of the condition began to take shape.\n\nBut CAPD is a protean entity, manifesting itself in myriad ways, each as insidious as a snake slithering through the grass. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, lost in a world where the world's soundscape is a vast, uncharted wilderness. They may struggle to differentiate between two or more acoustic events, like a shipwrecked sailor adrift in a sea of conflicting signals. They may be unable to recognize patterns, to discern the hidden rhythms that govern our language, or to detect the subtle cues that underpin our communication. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, like a flame extinguished by a gust of wind, leaving the individual adrift in a world of confusion.\n\nDiagnosis, that most Sisyphean of tasks, is as elusive as a will-o'-the-wisp, leading the unwary on a merry chase through a maze of tests and evaluations. Systematic observation and performance on tests of auditory function are the tools of the trade, wielded by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists who seek to unravel the tangled skein of this disorder. But there is no one test, no single litmus test, that can pinpoint the condition with certainty. The tools of diagnosis are various, a myriad of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations that seek to capture the elusive essence of CAPD. And at the heart of it all lies the unknown, the uncharted territory of the brain's inner workings, a mystery that continues to elude us.",
            "In the bitter tapestry of Twelfth Night, a subtle yet insidious theme unfurls like a poisonous bloom, threatening to consume all in its path. Deception, that most duplicitous of arts, is wielded like a razor, slicing through the fragile fabric of identity, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered illusions and broken bonds. For in the end, the art of disguise, though a potent tool for survival, may prove a curse, a weight that drags one down into the mire of self-estrangement.\n\nThe difficulty lies not in discarding the disguise, but in the knowledge that such a revelation may exact a terrible price. The person who sheds the mask may find themselves forsaken by those who had once known them, left to wander in a wilderness of alienation. And so, a choice is forced upon them: to preserve their own skin, or to surrender to the capricious whims of those who had once called them friend.\n\nThe guise of the other sex, in particular, proves a fraught and treacherous terrain, fraught with perils and uncertainties. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel compelled to forsake their own identity, to don the cloak of the opposite sex? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as Viola's words suggest, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)? Or is it a more profound and primal urge, a yearning to escape the constraints of their sex, to become something other than what they are?\n\nViola's decision to masquerade as a man in a foreign land is a stark reminder of the perils that lie in wait for those who would seek to deceive. Her ruse succeeds in protecting her from the predators that stalk the shadows, but it also isolates her from the very people who might have offered her solace. And yet, her deception proves so convincing that Olivia, the object of her affections, becomes hopelessly entangled in a web of confusion, loving the wrong person, yet somehow knowing not what is real. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138), she cries out, her words a cri de coeur that echoes through the desolate landscape of her own heart.\n\nAnd what of Orsino, that great and mighty lord, who finds himself torn asunder by his own desires? \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261), he confesses, his words a tortured admission of the secrets that lie hidden beneath the surface of his being. Does he truly love Cesario, or is it a mere fantasy, a fleeting dream that has taken on a life of its own? The answer, like the truth itself, remains shrouded in mystery, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the human heart.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a bleak and unforgiving world, a world in which the very fabric of reality is torn asunder by the threads of deception and desire. And it is here, in this desolate landscape, that we find ourselves forced to confront the darkest recesses of our own hearts, and the secrets that we keep hidden from the world.",
            "The German colonial behemoth, a monolith of oppression, cast its shadow across the face of Africa, leaving in its wake a trail of blood and desolation. The Ovaherero and Nama, their cultures reduced to ashes, their people consumed by the flames of genocide. Yet, to reduce the German colonial empire to such a singular deed would be to do it a disservice, for it was a creature of contradictions, its policies as shifting and treacherous as the sands that scar the Namib Desert. The empire's grasp was a tangle of diverse threads, each one a complex and multifaceted thing, like the colonized lands themselves.\n\nIn the East, where the British would later hold sway, the remnants of German education lay like a scattered and faded tapestry. Yet, even here, there were whispers of a greater effort, a concerted push to educate the native populations. The state schools stood as testaments to this endeavor, their walls bearing witness to the German dream of a civilized Africa. And in Kamerun, the whispers grew louder, a chorus of praise from contemporary voices attesting to the German commitment to education.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded, one of stark contrasts and unyielding bleakness. The government's gaze turned inward, its focus fixed on the Europeans, who were educated and nurtured with a fervor that left the native populations to wither in the shade. The missionary societies, feeble and underfunded, struggled to hold back the tide of illiteracy, their efforts as futile as a desert sandstorm against the vast and unyielding dunes. The government's support was meager, a paltry trickle in the face of a desert's insatiable thirst.\n\nAnd so the people of South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, their world reduced to the brutal simplicity of survival. The effects of this neglect would linger, a testament to the enduring power of colonialism's dark legacy. The social, political, and economic factors that shaped this desolate landscape were complex and multifaceted, a tangle of threads that defied easy explanation. This paper seeks to unravel some of these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations of South West Africa.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and imposing edifice, its walls constructed from the stones of early twentieth-century scholarship. The early works, written in German, were primarily concerned with describing the features of the educational systems in the colonies, their authors attempting to impose order on the chaos of colonialism. Later, English-language studies expanded the discourse, comparing and contrasting the educational systems of the various colonies, and delving deeper into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a beacon of insight, its author shedding light on the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, where the desert's unforgiving vastness gave way to temperate savannahs, its European population a tiny but influential minority. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 Europeans dwelled. The stage was set for a drama of contrasts, a clash of cultures and values that would shape the course of history in ways both subtle and profound.",
            "In the arid expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a desolate landscape, its disparate genres sprawling and twisting like a labyrinthine maze. The classification of this music has become an Sisyphean task, as the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres has rendered the endeavor futile. Yet, within this chaotic tapestry, one genre has emerged as a behemoth, its influence a dark and foreboding presence that casts a long shadow over the musical landscape: Heavy Metal.\n\nBorn from the primordial soup of rock music, Heavy Metal has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its diversity and expressiveness defying categorization. It is a music of excess, of unbridled emotion, of sonic brutality that assails the senses like a tempest. Its adherents have always been drawn to the darker recesses of the human experience, plumbing the depths of despair and madness for inspiration. And so, it is no surprise that Heavy Metal has become a kind of solipsistic mirror, reflecting the darker aspects of the human condition.\n\nThe genre's origins are shrouded in a haze of myth and legend, but it is said to have coalesced in the 1970s, a product of the psychedelic excesses of a generation. The Beatles' Helter Skelter, with its eerie, discordant rhythms and anguished lyrics, is often cited as one of the genre's earliest manifestations. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the dark and heavy, marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, as it pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in popular music.\n\nToday, the genre has spawned a multitude of sub-genres, each with its own unique identity and aesthetic. From the polished, melodic sheen of Power Metal to the brutal, dissonant roar of Black Metal, the diversity of Heavy Metal is a testament to its boundless creativity and adaptability. And yet, beneath the surface of this diversity lies a common thread, a shared fascination with the darker aspects of human experience. It is this thread that binds the genre together, a thread that weaves in and out of the fabric of human emotion, leaving an indelible mark on the listener.",
            "In the twilight of his years, before the dawn of the Surrealist movement, Henri Rousseau was fashioning his own dreams, his brushstrokes imbued with the fervor of the subconscious. The Dream, a haunting canvas from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's private torment: a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, yet also a reflection of Rousseau's own anguished pursuit. For years, he had toiled in obscurity, his zeal for recognition and acceptance driving him like a specter. The critical art world, with its strictures and expectations, loomed over him like a specter, threatening to extinguish the flame of his creativity. The Dream, a work of unflinching introspection, laid bare Rousseau's internal struggle: to surrender to the conventional and secure the approval of his peers, or to forge his own path, unencumbered by the weight of tradition.\n\nTo grasp the nuances of The Dream, one must first delve into the crucible of Rousseau's existence. Born on a May morning in 1844, in the rural town of Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had known the comfort of bourgeois prosperity. Yet Rousseau's life was marked by hardship and disappointment. He received no formal training in the arts, instead toiling in menial labor until the age of forty, earning the sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector, though his true calling remained unacknowledged. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a deep well of sorrow. In the face of such desolation, Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge, a means to find solace and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized the peasant, Rousseau's brush spoke from the heart of the common man, his hopes and dreams an unvarnished reflection of his own class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with the critical art world is a understandable affliction, given his circumstance. Unlettered in the ways of formal painting, he began his career at an advanced age, a fledgling among giants. As the years passed, he produced works of quiet beauty, yet recognition eluded him, even as Matisse's star began to rise. In the words of Jan Gordon, Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional, so redolent of the mainstream, that he might be admitted to the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, was driven by a terror of tedium, a fear of surrendering to the mundane. The Dream, a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, stands as a poignant reminder of the artist's eternal struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the expectations of the world.",
            "The notion of an unbroken bond between ethics and aesthetics has long captivated the minds of thinkers. Like wisps of smoke that cling to the fringes of our perception, the connections between truth and beauty tantalize, beckoning us to delve deeper. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The expectations that govern our understanding of the world, derived from education or the trials of life, falter in the face of the inexplicable allure of ethics and aesthetics. For in these realms, we find ourselves grasping for explanations, yet the very nature of beauty and morality defies codification. Our studies of art and morality are, by their very nature, an attempt to distill the essence of a work, to pinpoint what makes it beautiful or just, rather than a prescription for creation or judgment.\n\nCriticism, in its various forms, is an exercise in futility when it comes to capturing the essence of what is beautiful or just. We may dissect the Mona Lisa, parsing the intricacies of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these efforts ultimately fail to convey the reason behind its enduring appeal. It is in the face of such futility that we often hear the phrase \"There's just something about it,\" a hesitant admission that there lies a depth to the work that transcends words. Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the realm of ethics operates on a plane where words falter, leaving us with an inescapable feeling that something fundamental has been left unspoken. As Wittgenstein so eloquently put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nIt is this unbridgeable chasm between the spoken and the unsaid that forges a profound bond between art and morality. Both operate at a level that can be felt, but not fully articulated. In the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced, as McKean so astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" And it is in this shared territory that we find the essence of both art and morality: a mysterious, unnamable quality that speaks to us at the very core of our being.",
            "In the depths of the Teutonic heartland, a land forged from the primal fires of the Alpine crag, the shadow of the great mountains casts a long and storied presence, echoing through the storied streets of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic. The culture that births here, a tapestry woven from the threads of disparate voices, a symphony of the Rhine's dark waters and the verdant plains of Saxony. It is a culture born of the confluence of ancient forces, a melting pot of tribal bloodlines that, like the ebbing and flowing of the Elbe, have shaped the very essence of this place.\n\nThe name Germania, a label affixed to the ancestral homeland of the German folk, is a mystery, a riddle wrapped in the mists of forgotten time. The Roman chronicler Tacitus, a man of unyielding curiosity, posited that the name originated from the Tungrians, a tribe of unyielding ferocity, who roamed the unforgiving expanse beyond the Rhine, their presence a thorn in the side of the Gaulish hordes. And yet, the etymology of the name remains shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinthine puzzle that resists solution. The Roman conqueror Caesar, in his missives from the Gallic Wars, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the vanquished Gauls and the unvanquished tribes that dwelled beyond the Rhine, their restless spirits a constant thorn in the side of the Roman imperium. He drew this term from the Gaulish tongue itself, a language that would one day yield its secrets to the patient scholar.\n\nThe first chapter of Caesar's treatise on the Gallic Wars, a chapter that would one day become a testament to the tenacity of the Germanic peoples, speaks of the \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others propose that the name Germania may have derived from the spear, a primitive implement of war, the \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that evokes the cacophonous din of battle, a symphony of shouts and clashing steel.\n\nTacitus, that most astute of Roman historians, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, a people who, in his estimation, were an aboriginal presence, untainted by the influence of foreign bloodlines. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" he wrote. \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd what drove the Romans to seek out the distant shores of Germania? Certainly not a desire to supplant the native populations, for they would have known the futility of such an endeavor. No, they came for the riches that lay beyond the Rhine, for the goods and the skills that the Germanic tribes offered in exchange for their presence within the Roman imperium. And so, the Germanic tribes, those enigmatic figures that dwelled on the periphery of the Roman world, found themselves drawn into the orbit of the great empire, their lives forever changed by the encounter.

            "My gaze sank, a void that yawned open before me like a chasm.  The world's viscera lay exposed, a tapestry of textures and hues, but it yielded nothing to my understanding.  I regarded it with the detachment of a man standing at the edge of a precipice, aware of the abyss below but unmoored to its depths.  Thought flickered, a candle flame dancing in the breeze, its light flickering out as swiftly as it appeared.  My consciousness was a fluid, unbound, and it flowed over the scene like a river, leaving no ripples, no residue.\n\nYears ago, a mentor, a man of art, had recommended a book to me - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I had wanted to create since childhood, to coax images from the void, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the craft.  It spoke of the brain's processes, of how we see and interpret the world.  One technique it taught was to impose a frame upon the chaos, to reduce the complexity to a simple, manageable whole.  I recalled the exercise, but it was beyond my reach in that moment, lost in the turmoil of my own perceptions.\n\nBefore me lay the detritus of a world, a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a dining room, all reduced to a primal, overwhelming reality.  I stood, transfixed, a man gazing into the face of the abyss.  The masters had walked this path before me - Picasso in his blue period, Monet in his gardens, the Renaissance artists in their tapestry of color.  If I was to claim the title of artist, if I was to call myself creator, then this moment was my baptism, the birth of my art, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers closed around the pencil, and for an instant, my mind's turmoil stilled.  The muscles in my hand tensed, relaxed, and then tensed once more as I raised it to the page.  The water swirled, a calm, crystalline surface, unbroken by the ripples of my thoughts.  And then, like a leaf torn from its branch, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet, again and again, futilely attempting to dislodge the stubborn, brown mass. \n\nThe mop, a tool of my craft, lay limp in my hand, my feet splayed wide, my tie chafing against my neck like a gall.  I gazed upon the offending bundle, a bundle of waste, a message scrawled by an unknown hand for the janitors of Rite Aid to find.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then my hand reached out, grasping the sheet, and began to wrap itself in a futile attempt to protect itself from the filth.  Standing, bending, my hand descended, slow and deliberate, like a mother's hand moving into the oven on a winter's day.",
            "In the dark crucible of adolescence, a grim reckoning unfolds. The young, behind the wheel, are succumbing to the merciless whims of fate. The National Institutes of Health offer a stark revelation: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Inexperience, that corrosive stain on the fabric of youth, taints the driving habits of the young, precipitating a ghastly array of accidents: rollovers, speeding, and forsaking the fragile boundaries of the road.\n\nThe enthrallment of companionship only serves to exacerbate the peril. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center graphically illustrates the correlation between the age of passenger and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a tableau of fraternal recklessness, wherein the young, bound by ties of camaraderie, relinquish all restraint.\n\nIn response, California and other states have endeavored to temper the tempest by introducing provisional licenses, replete with restrictions on hours driven and the company kept. These palliative measures, however, merely scratch the surface of a deeper malaise. The fundamental issue remains: the young, as a collective entity, are woefully incapable of shouldering the burdens and risks attendant to driving.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage psychologist, posits that the tender age of 18 is still too soon for the unfettered privilege of a regular driver's license. His research suggests that those under the aegis of 19 or 20 are beset by an insatiable appetite for risk, a predilection for the thrill of the unknown. It is, then, a prudent course to delay the granting of licenses until this tendency has begun to subside.\n\nIf we persist in our current trajectory, the toll of death and destruction will only continue to mount, reaching staggering proportions as the Baby-Boomer's progeny assumes the reins of power. By 2010, a tidal wave of new teen drivers will flood the roads, their inexperience and recklessness unleashing a maelstrom of carnage.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly straightforward, would serve as a bulwark against this impending calamity. Driver's education classes, a staple of academic curricula, would continue to initiate the young into the mysteries of driving. Provisional permits, still issued prior to the granting of a full license, would remain, accompanied by a requisite number of practical training hours. This number, mirroring the already established standards of most states, would provide a semblance of continuity.\n\nA uniform, national mandate, rather than a patchwork of state-specific regulations, would be the most effective means of protecting the young from themselves. The proposed legislation, far from innovative, merely seeks to arrest a calamitous trend, to temper the ferocity of the tempest before it is too late.",
            "As I delved into the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's film archive, I found myself drawn to the earliest works of Edison - a collection of trick films born from the squalid fires of the 1890s, their presence a fleeting whisper of a bygone era. Fifteen of these aberrations, imbued with the mystical allure of sleight of hand, lay before me, their secrets waiting to be unraveled. My study, a meandering path through the desert of cinematic history, wove a tapestry of the poetics that governed these trick films, and the aberrant strains that emerged like a cancer in the later specimens.\n\nThese films, relics of a bygone age, adhered to the strictures of the time: set-bound, shackled to a frontal proscenium, their cameras rooted to a single, unyielding position. The images that danced upon the screen were frozen, a tableau vivant, as lifeless as the trees that stood sentinel in the desert. Long shots and medium shots, devoid of the fluidity of movement, told the story of a world in stasis. And yet, like the first raindrops on a parched earth, there were those that dared to defy the rules - the outliers, those aberrant films that shattered the brittle glass of convention.\n\nA common thread ran through these trick films, a thread of tawdry illusion. The camera, a prisoner of the proscenium, could not follow the figures that danced upon the stage. They moved, but only side to side, their steps choreographed like a macabre ballet. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors slid across the stage, their exits and entrances a ritualistic dance, the camera unmoving, a stationary sentinel. And when they vanished from view, the frame remained empty, a hollow shell, a reminder of the limitations of the medium.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, dictated the pace of the films. Long shots reigned supreme, their dominance unchallenged. Close-ups, those forbidden fruits, were unknown to these early trick films. The audience, like the audience in a theatre, saw the entire performance, a tableau vivant, frozen in time. The actors, like puppets on a string, did not move towards the camera, and so the close-up remained a distant dream, an unattainable goal.\n\nAnd so, most of these trick films adhered to the strictures of the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less, their narratives reduced to the brief, vaudeville-style tricks that had given birth to their existence. Magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks - these were the staples of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were blurred. But even in these earliest of films, a hint of deceit lurked, a whisper of the illusions that lay hidden beneath the surface. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, the camera's gaze lingers on the moment when the illusion is shattered, the severed head a grotesque reminder of the artifice that lay at the heart of these trick films.",
            "In the dusty expanse of the early American wilderness, a voice arose, a voice that would echo through the annals of history - that of John Taylor of Caroline, a man unyielding in his devotion to the creed of Republicanism. His hands, worn from the sweat and toil of the earth, had shaped his convictions, and his brief foray into politics had tempered his resolve. For in the unforgiving landscape of the agrarian life, one learned to cherish the freedom to till the soil, to reap the harvest, and to live unencumbered by the weight of an overreaching authority.\n\nHis was a world view inextricably linked to the land, where the rhythms of nature governed the pulse of life. It was this primal connection that informed his perspectives on governance, his fierce advocacy for a system of self-rule that would preserve the integrity of the individual, unencumbered by the shackles of a cabalistic elite. The Constitution, that sacred document, was to him a charter of liberty, a beacon of hope in a world where the forces of darkness threatened to consume all. And so, he walked a fine line, ever vigilant, ever watchful, lest the very institutions he sought to create become the instruments of oppression.\n\nTaylor's was a world of dualism, where the discordant notes of humanity's inherent nature - the good and the evil - walked hand in hand. He spoke of the \"state of nature\" as a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway. But in the civilization he sought to build, he envisioned a different paradigm, one where the virtues of the human condition - compassion, kindness, and fairness - would reign supreme. A government, he believed, must be a reflection of this duality, a balance of light and darkness, of order and chaos. For in the end, it was not the perfectibility of man that mattered, but the acknowledgment of his imperfectibility.\n\nAs he gazed out upon the vast expanse of the American wilderness, Taylor saw a people adrift, torn between the promise of liberty and the peril of despotism. He knew that a government, to be truly just, must be founded on the bedrock of good principles - the protection of private property, the nurturing of agriculture, and the curbing of the avarice that threatened to consume all. And so, he called for a strict construction of the Constitution, a literal interpretation that would safeguard the rights of the individual, and prevent the Federal government from becoming a behemoth, a monster that would devour the very freedoms it was sworn to protect.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, that sweeping manifesto that proclaimed the inherent dignity of all men, and the sovereignty of the individual. For in its pages, Taylor saw a reflection of the American dream, a dream of a people free to live their lives as they chose, unencumbered by the weight of tyranny. And so, he stood tall, a sentinel of freedom, a voice in the wilderness, warning of the dangers of despotism, and the importance of preserving the integrity of the individual in the face of a world that seemed determined to crush it.",
            "The descent in commuter log submissions in the third month was a stark and jarring thing to behold, a precipitous drop that defied easy explanation. Winter's chill had set in, and with it, the campus was blanketed in a silence that seemed to stifle the very life from the streets. Fewer footsteps echoed off the buildings, fewer wheels turned, as the cold and darkness of the season seemed to snuff out the spark of daily routine. The semester's end was nigh, and with it, the weight of finishing grades, of wrapping up loose ends, and of divesting oneself of the burdens of the academic year. The log, once a stalwart companion to the daily commute, had slipped from the radar, lost in the swirling vortex of holiday preparations and the long, dark winter's night. And yet, even as the semester's close had been anticipated, even as the break loomed ahead, the following month's log submissions faltered still. Perhaps, one might hazard, it was simply a matter of waning enthusiasm, a natural ebbing of the initial fervor that had greeted the project's inception. Or perhaps it was something more, a creeping sense that the effort had been for naught, that the allure of personal freedom and the independence of the automobile would prove too great to overcome. We sought to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting burst of energy and publicity designed to rekindle the embers of interest, and in March, at least, it seemed to have some small effect. But the challenge remained: how to sustain momentum in the face of the season's cadence, how to coax participation from a populace enamored of its cars, its freedom, and its independence. We had offered prizes, tokens of appreciation for those who chose to forsake their vehicles, but perhaps they were insufficient, perhaps they were too small, too paltry, to tempt the entrenched habits of a people. We gave away gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops, to massage therapists and bookstores, but what of something larger, something that would truly speak to the hearts of those who valued their autonomy above all else? A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car - would these not have been prizes worthy of note, worthy of effort? We may never know, but it is clear that the prizes, as they stood, were insufficient to overcome the siren's call of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the financial wilderness, a peculiar creature stalks its prey - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A creature of its own making, it mimics the index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet defies the conventional boundaries that bind its kin.  It moves with the fluidity of a wild animal, trading like a stock on the open exchange, yet retains the calculated diversification of a seasoned investor.\n\nThe allure of this beast is undeniable: the diversification of a byzantine index fund, coupled with the singular freedom of a lone stock.  One may sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in a transaction, all with the same ease as a seasoned trader.  And yet, the ETF's benefits come at a cost, a cost not of blood or sweat, but of commission, a toll paid on each and every transaction.  Still, the expense ratios of ETFs prove a fraction of those of their mutual fund cousins, a meager price to pay for the privilege of traversing the financial wilderness.\n\nBut as in any untamed land, dangers lurk in the shadows.  The ETF IHF, a creature of great appeal, beckons us to examine its inner workings.  We shall dissect its top ten holdings, those denizens that comprise 63.58% of its being, to determine if the promised benefits of ownership are more than mere mirage.  Do the benefits of a single ETF approximate the advantages of a diversified portfolio, or do they pale in comparison?  And if so, what configurations of these same stocks would yield an optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we shall narrow our focus to the top ten holdings, a deliberate sacrifice to avoid the overwhelming complexity of the whole.  We shall assign a value of 100% to these ten stocks, and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return, should the entire ETF be comprised of these very same stocks in the proportion dictated by its holdings.  The calculations, a cold and unforgiving arithmetic, are laid bare in the chart that follows.\n\nFrom these calculations, a sobering truth emerges: a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings would yield returns 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in the spoils of victory.  Moreover, the beta of this portfolio would be 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a testament to the power of concentrated ownership.  Yet, the possibility remains that these results may be the product of chance, a fleeting mirage on the horizon of statistical probability.\n\nTo dispel this doubt, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing their values to 100% to compare the accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.  Only then shall we be able to discern whether these portfolios are more than mere shadowy apparitions, or if they hold the promise of a tangible, profitable future.",
            "The dreamscape of \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the profound influence of Edgar Allan Poe's revered forebears. In this somnolent realm, the enigmatic term \"Thulé\" emerges like a specter, haunting the reader with its mystery. This word, as Thomas O. Mabbott astutely observes, owes its origins to the venerable Virgil, who invoked it to describe a mythic isle, a bastion marking the furthest reaches of the known world. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that Thulé's true provenance lies, and here Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe becomes all too apparent.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" reveals the striking similarities between the two poets' masterworks, leading the scholar to conclude that Poe was, in fact, emulating the great German master. The weight of this observation is underscored by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" had been published in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second, a testament to the author's unyielding dedication, in the year of his passing, 1832.\n\nWithin the second part of \"Faust,\" a poignant tale unfolds, that of \"The King of Thulé.\" This monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his wife, succumbs to the allure of the abyss, his grief and despair culminating in a tragic reckoning. He bestows his worldly possessions upon his children, save for the goblet, a token of his beloved, and, with a heavy heart, walks to the precipice, casts the vessel into the void, and meets his end. The echoes of this narrative reverberate throughout Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" a haunting echo of a similar despair, a dark doppelganger born of the same wellspring of sorrow.\n\nThe recurrence of Thulé in Poe's writings, a total of twice, serves as a testament to the profound impact of Goethe's work on his craft. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the phrase \"ultima Thule\" appears, a haunting refrain that finds its mirror in the somber cadences of \"Dream-Land.\" Here, the speaker finds himself lost in a desolate landscape, haunted by the specters of the dead, a world shrouded in an impenetrable veil of shadows and silence. The parallel with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" is striking, a convergence of two souls, bound by the shared experience of loss and despair.\n\nPoe's reverence for Tennyson, a poet whose work he held in high esteem, would have naturally led him to acquaint himself with the works of Goethe, whose influence on the English poet was profound. The numerous reproductions of Goethe's works, which followed the original publication, would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in the German master's oeuvre, a debt of homage that \"Dream-Land\" so eloquently repays.",
            "In the scorched landscape of California law, a question festers like an open wound. Can a plaintiff, scarred by a fall into the quagmire of an unheeded applesauce spill, claim punitive damages from a store manager whose callous disregard for the safety of his patrons has become a dark stain upon the store's conscience? The manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the spill's presence, yet he chose to indulge his own desires, dining while the customers suffered. The predictable consequences of his inaction came to pass, as Jennifer Palmer felt the full weight of her fall, her back shattered like the brittle promises of a failed ideal.\n\nA judge, wary of the defendant's claims of innocence, will likely not dismiss Palmer's plea for punitive damages out of hand. For a plaintiff to succeed in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were guided by a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was despicable in its contempt for the rights and safety of others. Palmer will argue that Martin's inaction was a manifestation of his callous disregard for the well-being of his customers, pointing to the six slip-and-fall incidents that had occurred in the preceding months, and the fact that he had been made aware of these incidents yet chose to do nothing.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a grim picture of neglect and indifference. On the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, only to be met with the manager's dismissive response. \"I'm on dinner break,\" he said, his words a cold comfort to the suffering customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous indifference. And at 5:30 pm, Palmer's world was shattered, her back broken by the unheeded spill. In the months preceding her fall, five other customers had suffered similar fates, their warnings unheeded by Martin's neglect.\n\nCalifornia law provides a framework for such cases, allowing punitive damages for breaches of obligation that arise from malice, oppression, or fraud. The statute defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately fails to avoid them. As the court in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co. so aptly put it, \"a willful and deliberate failure to avoid consequences\" is the hallmark of malicious conduct.",
            "It has been four years since I first embarked on an exploration of the tenets of Islam within the hallowed halls of CBC. The debates that raged within our discussion circle centered on a question that still lingers in the desolate expanse of our collective consciousness: is Islam a faith of hostility? In the aftermath of the cataclysm that shook the world on 9/11, I have borne witness to a metamorphosis in the manner in which Islam is perceived by the masses. The media, once a conduit for vitriol and scorn, has transformed into a bastion of tolerance, extolling the virtues of a faith that was once deemed anathema. It is a far cry from the America that in 2001 would have never countenanced a leader such as Barack Obama, a man whose lineage was forever bound to the mystical threads of Islam.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, its enigmatic narrative a labyrinthine puzzle that defies categorization. As I delved deeper into the annals of his life, I discovered a paradox that has haunted me to this very day. The Muhammad who is presented to us is a far cry from the conquering warrior who forged a dynasty through blood and steel. Instead, we are offered a portrait of a man humbled by his own mortality, a man who yielded to the whims of fate and the whispers of the divine. It is a narrative that seems at odds with the Muhammad of legend, the man who is said to have coerced converts with an iron fist, leaving a trail of vanquished tribes in his wake. Yet, as I read on, I began to discern a threads of deliberate manipulation, a calculated effort to present the Prophet as a martyr, a man who was misunderstood by the world and vindicated by the truth of his teachings.\n\nA cursory examination of the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad reveals a disturbing pattern of appropriation. The tale of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point. It is a narrative that speaks to a calculated attempt to present Muhammad as a humble messenger, one who eschewed grandeur and vainglorious display. But in doing so, do we not risk diminishing the very essence of the miracle? Do we not, in our zeal to lionize the Prophet, risk usurping the dignity of the Son of God? The effect is a kind of theological thievery, a brazen attempt to supplant the glory of Jesus with the shadow of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, I find myself troubled by the proliferation of stories that seem designed to illustrate the 'witnesses' who came to the Prophet, drawn by the radiant light of his teachings. Yet, on closer inspection, these tales often rely on hearsay and second-hand accounts, the credibility of which is dubious at best. The cumulative effect is a narrative that seems more concerned with providing proof of the Prophet's truth than with capturing the raw, unvarnished essence of his life.\n\nWhat grates most is the manner in which the biography seeks to exalt Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, portraying him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. But history, that unforgiving mistress, has a way of contradicting such a characterization. If Muslims today are to truly grasp the complexities of their Prophet's rise to power, they must confront the stark realities of his past, unvarnished by the filters of myth and legend.",
            "The embers of the Christ's teachings, kindled in his lifetime, were swiftly extinguished as the fire of Christian thought continued to spread beyond the reaches of his mortal grasp.  In the annals of history, a trajectory unfolds, a path that diverges further and further from its origin.  The world, now a tapestry of contrasts, reveals an insatiable hunger for progression, a yearning that supersedes the bounds of tradition.  Those entrenched in the past, resistant to the whispers of change, are but a faint murmuration, their voices lost in the din of a world in flux.  Yet, amidst the turmoil, a nascent awareness stirs, a dawning recognition that the Christianity of today is but a pale shadow of its namesake's pure intent.  The descent into the depths of history will be a long and arduous one, a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of time, yet the outcome is inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form.  As the clock ticks backwards, the accretions of doctrine will be stripped away, layer by layer, until naught remains but the essence of the Christ's message, unadorned and unvarnished.  When this trend sweeps across the American and European landscapes, it will leave in its wake a people drawn back to the simplicity of the Christ's teachings, untainted by the interpolations of subsequent thinkers.  The institution of the church, that bastion of tradition, will endure, yet its foundation will be cemented in a uniformity of belief, a return to the harmony of the Christ's original message.  In this journey, the tapestry of Christian diversity will be unravelled, thread by thread, until the very fabric of Christendom is rewoven into a seamless whole.  History, a grand tapestry of reversals, bears witness to this phenomenon: the Roman Empire, once the crucible of Christian persecution, became its champion; the slave-holding American South gave rise to a nation where African-Americans claim their rightful place as leaders.  The great reversal, yet to come, will play itself out within the realm of Christianity, a return to the wellspring of the Christ's words, a reading of his teachings as metaphors, rather than literal dogma.  And it is here, in the earliest dawn of Christian history, that we find ourselves.  A people, fragmented and disparate, drawn from the wellspring of Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  The Hebrew scriptures, a divinely revealed revelation, stood at the heart of this nascent faith, a faith that was not yet one, but many: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The Romans, masters of Jerusalem, had yet to leave their mark.",
            "The darkness that lies at the heart of humanity is a festering wound, a deep-seated rot that seeps into the very marrow of our existence. It is a cancer that consumes us, a voracious appetite that devours all in its path. And in the bleak, unforgiving landscape of Packingtown, we see this horror writ large. The great factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monoliths to the avarice that drives us, their smokestacks belching forth a noxious cloud of despair that hangs heavy over the city like a miasma of death.\n\nThe owners and managers, those self-appointed masters of fate, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel. They are titans, unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed solely on the horizon of profit, where the ruin of the world is but a distant rumble of thunder. As Sinclair's words attest, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". And in this stark, unyielding tableau, we see the devastation wrought by their unyielding pursuit of power.\n\nBut it is not merely the environment that suffers at their hands. The workers, those wretched souls who toil in the factories, are reduced to nothing more than mere cogs in a machine, their lives nothing more than a sacrifice to the altar of progress. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They are worked to the point of exhaustion, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed. And when they fall, they are cast aside, discarded like so much rubbish, their lives a mere statistic in the ledger of profit and loss.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set was a time of darkness, a time when the weak were preyed upon by the strong, when the law was a distant, distant echo that held no sway over the brutal whims of those in power. The workers were at the mercy of their masters, forced to toil in conditions that would break the strongest of wills. And when they rose up, when they dared to challenge the status quo, they were met with violence, with intimidation, with the cold, unyielding steel of the law. The unions that formed were little more than puppets, dancing on the strings of their masters, the poor workers paying the price for their failed rebellion.\n\nIn this pitiless landscape, the workers were reduced to nothing more than slaves, their lives a perpetual struggle to survive, to eke out a meager existence in a world that seemed designed to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\". It is a bleak, unflinching portrait of a world in which the strong prey upon the weak, in which the meek are devoured by the mighty. And it is a world that still exists, a world that threatens to consume us all.",
            "The contours of meaning are etched upon the canvas of our perceptions, shaped by the deft brushstrokes of the writer's craft. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master weaver of the tapestry of The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of techniques to imbue his words with the weight of significance. One such method is the judicious pairing of incongruous adjectives and nouns, whereby the inescapable aura of ambiguity settles upon the subject like a shroud. Another technique, one that Fitzgerald wields with singular precision, is the assignment of meaning to symbols, to colors, that is, which he then employs to conjure a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sets in motion a subtle dance of meaning, a pas de deux of white and gray, those monochromatic colors that bleed into one another like the gradations of a winter's dawn. The novelist's intent is plain: to invest these hues with the patina of significance, to make them bearers of the unspoken. And so, he sprinkles them throughout the narrative like so many seeds sown in fertile soil. White, with its connotations of purity and refinement, is juxtaposed against the more somber, the more worn, gray. In the novel's early pages, these colors are liberally applied, a testament to the ubiquity of their meaning.\n\nDaisy and Jordan, those insouciant daughters of privilege, are forever draped in white, their attire a paean to the niceties of high society. Nick, that bemused chronicler of the Great Gatsby's excesses, dons white flannels to Gatsby's party, an act of sartorial homage to the gilded elite. Tom, that self-satisfied paragon of respectability, sports a white shirt, an emblem of his unassailable status. Even Catherine, that waif-like creature, is \"powdered milky white,\" a vision of unblemished beauty. But Fitzgerald is not content to simply leave these colors to their own devices; no, he must imbue them with a deeper significance, a meaning that will later be revealed to be a mere illusion.\n\nAnd so, he scatters these colors throughout the landscape of the novel, investing them with a banality that belies their significance. The chasms of lower New York are \"white,\" a testament to the sterile, antiseptic quality of modernity. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder of the banality of their existence. Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" a monotonous, unremarkable whole. Even the plain, the common, are not immune to the novelist's ministrations: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" a childhood of uneventful, unremarkable ease; the cars in the Valley of Ashes are \"gray,\" a testament to the desolation that lies at the heart of the American Dream.\n\nBut Fitzgerald's use of color is not simply a matter of surface ornamentation; no, it is a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reader's perceptions, to create a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling. And so, he reserves the full impact of these colors for the character of Daisy, that elusive, enigmatic presence who haunts the novel like a ghost. It is in her \"little white roadster\" that we first catch a glimpse of her, a vision of elegance, of refinement. But this is an illusion, a mere facade, for we soon come to see that Daisy is nothing more than a uniform, a cipher, a mere addition to the grand tapestry of Gatsby's desires. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before Tom and Gatsby's encounter – all these serve to reinforce the notion that Daisy is nothing more than a pale imitation of life, a mere reflection of the emptiness that lies at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The parched earth of San Diego County, bleached by the unforgiving sun, yields a bounty of crops that would be the envy of any other land. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with a sweetness that is a testament to the mild climate. Citrus fruits, like lemons and peaches, hang heavy with juice, their tartness a perfect balance to the richness of the earth. Leafy greens and squash sprout from the earth, their verdant hues a stark contrast to the scorched landscape. And in the midst of this plenty, the creatures of the wild roam free, unencumbered by the chemicals that decimate the land elsewhere.\n\nOrganic farming, a practice that eschews the toxic trappings of conventional methods, has found a home in this corner of the county. The demand for locally grown, chemical-free produce is insatiable, with many a hungry customer willing to wait in line for a taste of the real thing. And it is here, in the rolling hills and sun-baked valleys, that the landowner finds an opportunity to reap the rewards of the government's largesse, while nurturing the very earth that gives so bountifully.\n\nBut it is not without its costs. The road to organic farming is a long and arduous one, marked by the sweat and toil of manual labor. The pests and weeds that plague the land must be vanquished, not with poison, but with the sweat of the brow. And the soil, that most precious of resources, must be coaxed and tended, its fertility nurtured by the gentle art of compost and mulch. The losses, too, are greater, the harvests uncertain, the yields unpredictable. And yet, it is in this very uncertainty that the landowner finds a chance to fashion a life that is at once profitable and redemptive.\n\nThe land itself, a 160-acre parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, lies adjacent to the town of Potrero, its borders marked by the Cleveland National Forest. It is a place of ancient stories, where the whispers of the past mingle with the rustle of leaves and the songs of birds. The ecoregion, the Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, is a tapestry woven from over a hundred species of plants and animals, each one a thread in the grand narrative of this land. And here, too, the landowner finds a mandate to preserve, to protect, and to restore, for the sake of the creatures that call this place home.\n\nThis land, like all lands, has a history that stretches back into the mists of time. The Native Americans, a people long forgotten, once roamed these hills and valleys, leaving behind a legacy of stories and traditions that still echo in the wind. And later, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their sweat and toil shaping the landscape into the contours we see today. And I, a seeker of knowledge, chose this land, this place of promise and peril, as the stage for my inquiry, a place where the threads of profit and preservation might be woven into a tapestry of sustainability.",
            "Culture, a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of what it is not, and what it signifies, hangs in the balance of every negotiation. It is a realm where certainties are cruelly shrouded in the uncertainty of the unknown, a place where the comfort of absolutes is a luxury few can afford. To speak of a culture in simplistic terms, to reduce it to a monolithic entity, is to invite the specter of misunderstanding. The notion that all Russians are stubborn, or that all Japanese are accommodating, is a notion born of convenience, a crude approximation that does little to illuminate the complex topography of a people. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities, imperfect though they may be, that we find a glimmer of insight into the workings of a culture's heart.\n\nTo navigate the uncharted waters of a foreign culture, one must be willing to surrender the comfort of familiarity, to venture into the wilderness of the unknown. It is a journey that may take us down the dusty paths of history, through the twisted labyrinth of prejudices, and into the dark recesses of the human experience. And it is here, in this twilight realm, that we find the keys to unlocking the secrets of a culture's soul.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the culture itself that we must understand, but the culture's significance, its particular resonance, its unique melody that echoes through the chambers of the human heart. It is this that will dictate the rhythm of our interactions, the cadence of our words, the very fabric of our being. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to move beyond the barriers that divide us, to transcend the petty squabbles of nationality and creed, and to speak a language that is universally understood.\n\nBut culture, like the desert itself, is a vast and unforgiving expanse, a realm where the boundaries of nation and corporation blur and blend. The corporate culture, a curious beast, roams the landscape, its habits and rituals as mysterious as the creatures that inhabit it. We see it in the dress codes that govern our behavior, in the style of communication that shapes our words, in the hiring practices that determine our fate. And we see it in the philanthropic endeavors that bring us together, or drive us apart.\n\nAnd so, we must not be fooled by the façade of uniformity, the surface-level calm of a culture's exterior. For it is in the depths, in the hidden recesses of the human experience, that we find the true essence of a people. The values that govern our actions, the why of our being, are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of a culture. And it is these values, these primal forces that drive us forward, that will dictate the course of our interactions, the outcome of our negotiations.\n\nTo understand these values, to grasp the underlying currents that shape a culture's behavior, is to gain a deeper understanding of the opponent, of the person across from us at the negotiating table. It is to see beyond the mask of strangers, to glimpse the human being, with all their frailties and strengths, their triumphs and weaknesses. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to connect, to transcend the barriers that divide us, and to forge a path forward, together.",
            "In the hollow recesses of the human heart, a voice whispers an ancient lie: \"There is no God.\" This blasphemy echoes through the pages of the Christian Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, and is the fulcrum upon which the weighty argument of St. Anselm turns. His reasoning, a Sisyphean endeavor to grasp the ungraspable, begins with the assumption that the God of the Bible exists. To posit an alternate deity would be to shackle our inquiry, rendering the comparison between Anselm and his contemporary, Thomas Aquinas, moot. Like two travelers on a desolate road, their arguments converge, each seeking to illuminate the darkness that shrouds the existence of the divine.\n\nYet, as we embark on this arid journey, it becomes apparent that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive foundation for their shared conviction. Their arguments, like two brittle twigs, snap under the weight of scrutiny. Anselm's passage meanders through the labyrinthine corridors of the human mind, seeking proof of God within the recesses of one's own psyche. He posits that the nonexistence of God is inconceivable, a notion that defies the mortal grasp. The mind, a vessel for the divine, contains within it the seeds of truth. Empirical evidence, a fleeting whisper in the void, is superfluous. Faith, that stubborn flame that flickers in the darkness, is the conduit to understanding.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stalks the savannah of reason, his footsteps echoing with the beat of logic. He decrees that the existence of God can be proven, that the rational faculties can illuminate the path to the divine. His five arguments, a quintet of logical certainties, unfold like a tapestry of inevitability. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each thread in the fabric of existence – converge to form the unshakeable edifice of God's existence. The missing piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the divine, can be deduced with unyielding logic, its presence felt, if not seen.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, around the fifth or sixth century's tenebrous veil, a prince would emerge, destined to be known as the Buddha. His path would be one of renunciation, a rejection of the world's futility, and an ascent into an unshakable gnosis. From this enlightenment, the tenets of Buddhism would unfurl like a dark, unyielding banner, leading to the formation of the most austere sect - Theravada Buddhism. More than two millennia have since elapsed, and the faith has undergone a metamorphosis, its visage transformed by the cruel hand of time. This metamorphosis is palpable in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual bereft of any direct connection to the Buddha's teachings, is observed with fervor by monks and laymen alike. This dichotomy is but a symptom of a greater malady, one that afflicts the very essence of the faith - the soteriological core.\n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been forced to adapt, to evolve in response to the capricious winds of external and internal forces, both malevolent and benign. These forces have reshaped the doctrinal principles of the faith, casting long shadows across the landscape of the Buddhist world. The terms that will be employed in this discussion must first be defined, lest the reader become lost in the labyrinthine corridors of our inquiry. An internal force is a power born of the Buddhasasana, a force that emanates from within the community, regardless of monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, are those that originate from beyond the boundaries of the Buddhist world. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or destroy the Buddhist community, its malevolent energies fueled by a pernicious perception of the faith. A benign force, though, is a power that neither seeks to harm nor aid the community, its actions often a byproduct of its own inertia.\n\nTo fully comprehend the profundity of the faith, it is essential to delve into the fundamental doctrines that underlie Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine repository of wisdom, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka prescribes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical mysteries of the faith. It is within these mysteries that one discovers the notion of Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that permeates existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. Only through the recognition of these concepts can one hope to transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, a prison from which lobha, dosa, and moha - desire, hatred, and delusion - enthrall us. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules for a life of discipline, prescribing five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not indulge in lust, and I shall not succumb to intoxication) and a stricter regimen for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha - the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is the font of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The shadow of discord loomed over the twin nations of America and Mexico, a specter of enmity that persisted for nigh on 57 years, from the bloody annals of 1836 to the waning embers of 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this discord was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the land from 1846 to 1848, as the United States laid claim to the spoils of war: the parched expanse of Texas and the arid Southwest. But the clash between these two nations was not a singular event; rather, it was a recurring thread that wove itself through the fabric of their history, like a patient and unyielding worm.\n\nThe schism that rent asunder these two nations was rooted in the fundamental differences that had taken hold since the earliest days: the American heartland, with its Protestant fervor and rugged individualism, stood in stark contrast to the Mexican soul, steeped in the traditions of the Catholic Church. And then there were the material interests, the rivalries that arose from the clash of competing ambitions, as Schmitt (1974, pp. 30-31) so astutely observed. These were the fault lines that would prove impossible to bridge, the fissures that would seep and spread, like a slow-moving stain, until the very foundations of their relationship were laid bare.\n\nIt is a tale as old as time itself: nations born of shared borders, yet bound by irreconcilable differences. The United States and Mexico were not alone in this regard; the annals of history are replete with examples of such rivalries, forged in the crucible of competing interests and unyielding ideologies. David M. Pletcher (1977, p. 41) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" And indeed, the proximity of these two nations to the United States, their shared geography and history, only served to heighten the tensions that simmered between them.\n\nThe specter of religious intolerance cast a long shadow over the relationship between these two nations, a specter that had haunted the Western world for centuries. As Sally Frahm (2001, p. 86) so eloquently phrased it, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The animosity that had been kindled between the English and Spanish, the rival colonizers of the New World, had left a legacy of distrust that would take centuries to eradicate.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 discrete instances of conflict between the United States and Mexico during this 57-year period, a litany of disputes that seemed to have no end. The majority of these conflicts centered on the contested territory of the borderlands, where outlaws and bandits preyed on the weak and the unwary. It was not until the United States and Mexico jointly exerted their military might that the lawlessness that had plagued the border was finally tamed (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd yet, even as the rivalries between these two nations continued to simmer, a change was afoot. As Schmitt (1974, p. 109) so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way,\" and the tides of history began to shift. The ambitions of the United States, once bent on territorial expansion, now turned toward economic intervention, a subtle yet decisive shift that would ultimately bring an end to the long-standing enmity between these two nations.",
            "Fifteen years have passed since the darkness claimed me, a fateful and uninvited guest that stole my youth and severed my limbs, leaving me crippled and forlorn. I was a nurse, a guardian of the frail and the afflicted, driven by a primal urge to escape the abyss of my own childhood. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a callous benediction, still haunts me: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so, I chose the path of least resistance, the comforting familiarity of a profession that promised stability and security.\n\nBut it was a lie. At 46, I was reduced to a hollow shell, a specter of my former self, with nothing to show for my years but the cold, unforgiving face of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed since I surrendered to the void, and I am left with nothing, a pauper in a world that no longer recognizes me. Each day is a struggle, a battle to survive in a landscape devoid of hope. My existence is a perpetual assault on my very being, a slow unraveling of the threads that once bound me to a sense of self-worth.\n\nAnd yet, I know this much to be true: it was the kindness of strangers, the unwavering love of family and a few steadfast friends that kept me afloat, even when I thought myself drowning in the undertow of despair. For when disaster strikes, and it will strike, we are not as strong as we think. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken.\n\nThis is a lesson I have learned the hard way, a truth that I now preach to anyone who will listen. We delude ourselves when we believe we can navigate the tempests of life alone, that we can outrun the darkness that lurks within and without. We need each other, we need to learn to trust, to rely on one another, to extend a hand when the winds howl and the rain pounds against our doors.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, that sacred cow of the American psyche, is just that – a myth. Our forebears did not traverse the unforgiving expanse of the Rockies on their own, nor did they thrive in the face of adversity through sheer willpower alone. No, it was the communal spirit, the shared struggle, and the collective resilience that sustained them. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, we are not islands, but a fragile web of interconnected lives.\n\nSo, I will continue to prepare, to stockpile what little I can against the coming storms. I will hoard candles and matches, canned goods and water purifying tablets. But I will also cultivate relationships, nurture the soil of community, and tend to the garden of trust. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will save us, but the love, the compassion, and the shared humanity that will see us through the darkness. Get to know your neighbors, for in them lies our only hope.",
            "The tortured trajectory of life, etched in the curves and whorls of a shell, a testament to the indomitable will of evolution. Yet, the underlying forces that shape this path, the unseen currents that guide the direction of change, remain shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, in his epochal work, could only hint at the unfathomable complexity of organic form, reduced to a mere dream of mathematical language. And so, too, today. The zoologist, armed with the tools of modern science, still struggles to comprehend the unforgiving logic of life.\n\nIt is within this void that our research endeavors to shed light. By marrying mathematical modeling with the brutal beauty of experimentation, we seek to unravel the very fabric of evolutionary-developmental change in the humble Prunum. We have employed X-radiographic images to distill the essence of skeletal growth, to quantify the parameters that govern the morphogenesis of this enigmatic creature. These metrics, inscribed in the code of CerioShell, have enabled us to model hypothetical shell morphologies, to conjure the ghostly outlines of what might have been.\n\nThe shell, that most intimate and familiar of structures, reveals itself to be a complex topography of space and time. A tube that unwinds through the ages, its whorls a testament to the iterative dance of growth and decay. The columella, that invisible axis, runs like a spine through the very heart of the shell, a reminder of the underlying order that governs this chaotic beauty.\n\nWe have come to understand the shell as a series of apertures, a sequence of openings and closures that chart the trajectory of the animal's existence. By tracing the path of the aperture, we may unlock the secrets of the shell's growth, and in doing so, gain a glimpse into the very heart of evolution. The trajectory, a sine wave of time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, its parameters tweaked and varied to reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nOur research is an attempt to grasp the unseen hand that guides the direction of change, to comprehend the cold calculus of evolution that shapes the world around us. It is a journey into the very heart of existence, a journey that may yet reveal the hidden truths of life itself.",
            "The stillness of infant mortality in Indonesia's dark tapestry remained persistent, an unyielding thread that defied the passing of ten years.  Like a specter, the country hovered on the precipice of its Millennium Development Goals, the targets of which seemed as elusive as a mirage on a desert's burning sands.  The statistics whispered of progress, of 72% of births attended by skilled hands, but it was a number that belied the harsh reality.  For in the shadows, the midwives toiled, their limited knowledge a fragile shield against the raging tempest of complications that could snuff out life in an instant.  And so the maternal deaths persisted, a grim testament to the frailty of hope.\n\nIn the rural expanse, the divide between the haves and have-nots yawned wide, a chasm that swallowed the poor whole.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4% of the total, spoke of a system that was woefully inadequate, a patchwork of patchwork solutions that failed to reach the most vulnerable.  The urban elite, with their 7% rate, stood as a gilded cage, a reminder of the systemic inequity that crippled the rural masses.  The gap between the poorest and richest quintiles, a yawning 27%, spoke of a healthcare system that was rigged against those who needed it most.\n\nThe question loomed large, a specter that haunted the dreams of those who sought to improve the lot of Indonesia's mothers and children.  Should the country pursue the siren song of programmatic solutions, with their promises of quick fixes and targeted results?  Or should it take a more fundamental approach, one that strengthened the very foundations of the health system, a labyrinthine edifice that seemed to shift and twist like a living thing?  The allure of vertical approaches was undeniable, their speed and efficiency a tantalizing prospect.  But the drawbacks were legion: the siphoning off of resources, the duplication of effort, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that created a maze of paperwork and red tape.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a fleeting panacea and a deep and abiding cure.  The path ahead was shrouded in uncertainty, but one thing was clear: the status quo was a recipe for disaster, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume them all.  The question was, would Indonesia find the courage to confront the darkness head-on, or would it continue to dance with the devil of incremental progress, forever trapped in a cycle of half-measures and half-truths?",
            "In the brooding tapestry of Victorian novels, a rare thread of discord weaves its way through the grand estates and stately manors. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, refuse to be bound by the conventions of their time. These works, like a dark and foreboding storm, inject an air of mystery and the unsettling into the staid tradition. The result is a depth of characterization that probes the very marrow of their protagonists, laying bare the tangled skein of their emotions and motivations.\n\nAs the words of the narrator seep into the mind of the narrator of Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion threatens to consume him. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's hasty argument still linger, a cacophony that refuses to be silenced. The sound of firearms shatters the air, and the protagonist is borne away on a tide of chaos, bereft of control. Through the swirling vortex of his perceptions, a nagging sense of pain gnaws, a constant and tormenting reminder of the indelible marks left by the world.\n\nThese novels exploit the dreamlike state to great effect, each in its own peculiar way. In Oliver Twist, the glimpses of the unknown serve to illuminate the tortured recesses of Oliver's psyche, laying bare the depths of his inner turmoil. The shooting, that pivotal moment that has left him scarred, assumes a dreamlike quality, as if etched in his very being. His struggles to find aid, his senses dulled by the proximity of death, serve only to underscore the stark reality of his powerlessness. The unseen hand that bears him away is a potent metaphor for the unforgiving whims of fate, a force that reduces him to a mere pawn in a game he cannot control. This is a man consumed by despair, his will shattered, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the desolate wasteland of his existence, time itself loses all meaning. The day blurs into night, a fleeting moment of respite between the crushing weight of time's indifference. The silence is oppressive, a heavy pall that clings to the soul like a shroud. And yet, even in this desolation, there lies a fleeting sense of hope, a glimmer of defiance in the face of an uncaring universe.",
            "The memory of that boy, Adrian, still lingers like a specter, a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between him and the world of words. I recall the days spent in the after-school program, struggling to impart the arcane secrets of English reading to the elementary age children. My own strengths lay in the realm of language and literature, but it was Adrian who presented the most singular challenge. His grasp of certain letters was as sure as the rising sun, while others seemed an insurmountable obstacle, a puzzle he couldn't decipher. His eyes, dark and unfathomable, would stare at the page, a mixture of frustration and despair etched upon his face.\n\nAs a Latino boy, I had assumed that his language skills would be limited to the tongue of his people, but his English was flawless, a testament to the complexities of identity and culture. Yet, it was not the language itself that held him back, but the silent, unspoken knowledge of the English alphabet. It was only when I beheld his mother, a woman who spoke little English, that the truth dawned on me like a revelation. Her presence was a reminder that the language barrier was not just a matter of words, but of worlds.\n\nThat incident has stayed with me, a poignant reminder of the unseen struggles that unfold in the shadows of our schools. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, stands as a sentinel, guarding the gates of knowledge and opportunity. It is a problem that plagues not just the children who speak little English, but also those who speak it with ease. The solution, I discovered, lay in the simplest of things: tutoring, specifically in the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who navigate the treacherous waters of a dual language system, the answer is far more complex.\n\nThe dual language system, that oft-maligned and misunderstood beast, holds a secret: it works. Children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the dual blades of language and culture. The fear-mongers would have you believe that this approach is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford. But I say, it is not a luxury, but a necessity. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit.\n\nBut how do we accomplish this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be a Sisyphean task, an impossibility. Instead, we can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever label we choose to assign them, who are fluent in both languages. The key lies not in a single solution, but in a multifaceted approach, one that combines the best of both worlds. Only through such a union can we bridge the chasm that separates us, and allow all children to access the rich waters of knowledge and opportunity.",
            "A presence, a specter, a force beyond mortal comprehension, looms over us from the moment we take our first faltering breaths. Some of us seek answers in hallowed halls of worship, while others delve within the recesses of their own troubled minds. Many cling to the faith passed down to them by the hands that bore them, yet others reject it wholeheartedly, convinced that the universe is a vast, uncaring expanse devoid of purpose. We wander, each of us, in search of a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the scorching brilliance of the sun. But what lies beyond the veil of our understanding remains a mystery, a riddle that refuses to yield its secrets.\n\nMy father, a man worn down by the trials of life, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, his eyes lost in a distant realm. We sat on the creaking porch of our home, the rain drumming a mournful dirge on the tin roof above us. The guttering plants along the edge of the porch were drowning in the downpour, their withered leaves a stark reminder of the transience of all living things. His frame, once robust, now seemed shrunken, his clothes hanging limply from his bony shoulders. His hair, too, had thinned, a stark contrast to the robust mane that once framed his face. He brooded, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the rain, his gaze a mixture of longing and reminiscence. I felt a creeping sense of dread, a feeling of loss that threatened to consume me whole. I knew that speaking of it would only make it more real, more tangible, and so I chose to say nothing, instead drawing closer to him, and joining him in his vigil.\n\nMy father passed on into the great unknown a few days after my twenty-second birthday, his body ravaged by the merciless forces of disease. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? What was the value of a life spent in torment, of a body worn down by the relentless assault of pain? I could not say. And so, I chose not to watch, to spare myself the anguish of witnessing the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father in all his vibrant, living glory, not in the cold, dark recesses of death. And so, I turned my back on the spectacle, and waited, curled up in a ball, for the news to come to me.\n\nNo one came.",
            "In the sun-scorched expanse of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as a paradox, a union of ancient and modern, a marriage of the moribund and the new. As Ian Watt so astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this supposedly oxymoronic genre is in truth a testament to the eternal power of the human imagination. Though derided by some as a shallow exercise in sentimentality, the Gothic mode has long been a wellspring of the sublime, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the fringes of our collective consciousness.\n\nAt its inception, the Gothic novel was a creature of contradictions, a chimera born of the medieval romances and the modern novel of manners. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, that seminal work, was a deliberate amalgam of the old and the new, a pastiche of theatricality and naturalism. In it, Walpole sought to create a new form of literary expression, one that would marry the grandiose and the mundane, the chivalric and the profane. The word \"Gothic,\" of course, was already freighted with meaning, a term that conjured images of a bygone era, a relic of a bygone age. Yet it was precisely this quality of archaism that Walpole sought to exploit, to imbue his novel with a sense of timelessness, of a connection to the eternal.\n\nOne of the most enduring features of the Gothic novel is its fascination with the ideal of chivalry, that most noble of medieval virtues. The code of chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a powerful symbol of a bygone era, an era of grandeur and nobility. And it was this very ideal that Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, saw as being lost in the crass and utilitarian world of modernity. Through their characters, they sought to recapture the essence of that lost era, to idealize and romanticize the past, even as they critiqued the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this is nowhere more evident than in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, a paragon of chivalric excellence.\n\nFrederic, it is said, has suffered greatly, has known the sting of tragedy and the pangs of loss. His very existence is a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit, a spirit that refuses to be extinguished by the cruel hand of fate. And yet, even as we behold him, we are aware of the excesses of his nature, the grandiose gestures and the bombastic language that betray a deeper sense of unease, of disquiet. For in the world of the Gothic novel, excess is a hallmark of the sublime, a manifestation of the human condition in all its messy, contradictory glory.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, there exists a labyrinthine process known as supply chain management. A rigorously defined sequence of events, it unwinds from the customer's whispered demand to the raw materials that fuel its creation, traversing the unforgiving terrain of production, supply, and distribution. The term, a relatively recent invention, was coined in 1982 by the inscrutable Keith Oliver, a consultant driven by an unyielding desire to impose order upon the chaotic dance of goods.\n\nThe process is a delicate ballet, comprised of six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These constituent parts, when expertly choreographed, yield a symphony of efficiency and customer satisfaction. The conductors of this endeavor, the business managers, must grapple with the unforgiving demands of production, the first and most crucial step in the supply chain.\n\nProduction is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice is constructed. It is the origination point from which the goods flow, a crucible where raw materials are transformed into something of value. The production stage is a litmus test, a proving ground where the managers' foresight and planning are put to the ultimate test. They must divine the customer's desires, parsing the market's cryptic language to discern the hidden patterns of demand. The market, a capricious mistress, holds the secrets of customer satisfaction within its depths, and it is the manager's duty to excavate these secrets, to uncover the hidden truths that will guide their decisions.\n\nOnce the market's will has been deciphered, the manager must determine the optimal production levels, the precise quantities that will satiate the customer's hunger without succumbing to excess. The choice of production location, a decision fraught with peril, is a delicate balancing act, a tightrope walk between quality and volume, the demands of the customer and the costs of production. Every misstep, every miscalculation, threatens to send the entire edifice crashing down, a house of cards brought low by the winds of inefficiency.\n\nIn the Wal-Mart and Target retail stores where I once toiled, I witnessed firsthand the importance of a well-defined process. The meticulous design of every aspect, from employee attire to receiving shipments, served as a bulwark against chaos, a beacon of order in a sea of uncertainty. Theoreticians may debate the merits of such systems, but the results speak for themselves: a smoothly functioning machine, its various parts working in harmony, a symphony of efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second key element in this intricate dance, is the strategic apotheosis of the supply chain. It is the moment when the manager's decisions coalesce into a cohesive whole, a synthesis of core competencies and outsourcing partnerships that yield velocity, that elusive quality of flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A company's divisions, each a specialized entity with its own strengths and weaknesses, must be marshaled in a campaign to outmaneuver the competition, to outproduce and outprice the opposition. The manager's task is to orchestrate this complex ballet, to allocate resources with precision, to strike the perfect balance between quality and cost.",
            "In a desolate corner, a lone figure stands, a fragile silhouette against the backdrop of a crumbling world. Ellen Page, a face once familiar to the screens of the masses, now a mere specter, holds aloft a makeshift placard, the letters scrawled in a desperate hand - \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The audacity of the claim hangs in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet cast at the very notion of truth itself.\n\nIn the heart of Southeast Asia, a nation shrouded in the shadows of tyranny, the Burmese junta reigns supreme, its grip on power a crushing weight that has borne down upon its people for decades. The coup d'état that seized power in 1962 was but a mere whisper in the annals of time, a precursor to the horrors that would unfold. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, a burst of crimson and gold that danced across the streets, only to be extinguished by the cold, calculating hand of oppression.\n\nMonks, those humble guardians of the soul, donned the fiery hue of their robes, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But the guns of the junta cut short their sacred cries, the sound of silence a stark reminder of the price of dissent. Foreign eyes, those of the curious and the brave, were met with a hail of bullets, their cameras shattered, their words silenced. Kenji Nagai, a lone journalist, fell to the ground, his lifeless body a testament to the junta's unyielding resolve.\n\nAnd yet, this too is nothing new. The urge to dominate, to crush the spirit, has been a constant companion to the exercise of power, a thread that weaves its way through the tapestry of human history. The emperors of old, self-proclaimed gods, ruled with an iron fist, their subjects cowed by the weight of their decrees. The Japanese, in their imperial hubris, saw themselves as deities, sent to guide their people to a promised land of prosperity and death. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness continue to resound, the drums of war beating out a rhythm of oppression.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich - all these and more serve as a grim reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. The numbers are lost, the bodies counted only in the thousands, the screams of the silenced swallowed by the void. The faces of the fallen fade into the dust, their stories reduced to mere footnotes in the grand tome of human suffering. And yet, in this desolate landscape, we find ourselves, fragile, finite, and forever bound to the wheel of history.",
            "In the shadow of his years, Duke Ellington's presence loomed, a colossus who sculpted his orchestra with an artist's deft hand. His piano touch, though often understated, wove an intricate tapestry of sound, as each musician's thread was expertly interwoven into the fabric of his compositions. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble was a symphony of diverse voices, a delicate balance of individuality and cohesion, where soloists danced upon the framework he had so carefully crafted. His music was a slow-burning fire, fueled by the passions of his players, as he coaxed forth the essence of each instrument, tempering the blaze with his own genius.\n\nIt was in the early days, with the Creole Love Call, that Ellington's innovative spirit first took flight, his voice soaring like a bird set free. Here, he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument, its rich tones infusing the composition with an otherworldly quality. A twelve-bar blues, it unfolded with deliberate, unhurried pace, six choruses that unfolded like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engaged in a call-and-response, the sound smooth as silk, then rough as the desert wind. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborated on the melody, its notes extended like the shadows of a dying sun. The clarinet solo in the third, a swift, urgent thing, danced across the keyboard like a leaf on a gust of wind. The full band responded in the fourth, a chorus of brass and reeds, a symphony of sound that echoed the first like a ghostly refrain. The fifth, a climactic, reed-dominated chorus, pulsed with the rhythm of the city, syncopated beats like the heartbeat of a wild animal. And in the sixth, the voice, now a growling, guttural thing, took on the instrument's role, soloing like a wild, untamed creature. The final tag, a dissonant, jarring note, like a scream in the night, left the listener reeling.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration and tone color reached new heights. Here, he paired the muted trumpet of Bubber Miley with the scat singing of Baby Cox, the vocal elements of Miley's playing blending with Cox's instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he summoned forth the talents of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, whose muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, insistent beauty. Through these works, Ellington's innovative spirit, his ability to coax forth the hidden harmonies of his players, left an indelible mark on the jazz landscape.",
            "The void within her had been a constant, a gnawing ache that refused to be sated. It had taken root when she was but a girl, a tender shoot of fourteen, and had grown stronger with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, the ache still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal. Her desires had shifted from the ephemeral to the material, yet none of the boys who had sought her out had stirred within her a spark. They came and went, their clumsy attempts at wooing her a cruel mockery, a reminder of her isolation. She wandered the halls of her mind, searching for answers, but they remained elusive, hiding behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe days passed, a monotonous routine of questioning and doubt. Her parents, a tranquil couple, rarely raised their voices, their calmness a balm to her soul. Her own nature, a tempestuous blend of independence and free spirit, was a counterpoint to their serenity. Yet, on this particular day, the stillness was shattered.\n\nShe moved through the rooms, searching for solace, when the sound of her mother's cry pierced the air. A shriek, a word torn from her lips, sent her racing to the kitchen. There, her mother lay on the floor, her body a twisted mass of pain. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" the words came in short, gasping breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side, her heart racing with fear. She grasped her mother's hand, trying to offer what comfort she could. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's eyes, clouded with pain, directed her gaze, and she obeyed, carrying her mother to the car, setting her gently in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a noxious blend of disinfectant and sickness, assaulted her senses, but she was beyond such considerations. Her mind was consumed by worry, her thoughts a jumble of fear and uncertainty. She called out to the doctors, her voice a distant echo in the sterile corridors. A team of faces, etched with concern, gathered around, and they swiftly lifted her mother onto a gurney, their movements a blur. The doctors whisked her away, leaving her to pace, her heart heavy with foreboding.\n\nThe fall, a simple misstep on a stepping stool, had brought her mother to her knees. A vase, out of reach, had seemed within grasp, and she had overreached, her body betraying her. Now, as her daughter waited, her mind was a maelstrom of worry, her love and fear for her mother a palpable thing.",
            "The desolate terrain of the human heart, laid bare by the ravages of time, is a landscape of withered blood vessels and clogged arteries, its beauty lost to the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke.  This study sought to chart the topography of a diet that might chart a different course, a \"Mediterranean Diet\" that promised a gentler slope, a less treacherous path through the wilderness of disease.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a metric born from the Med diet's fertile soil, measured the fidelity of a woman's adherence to this dietary catechism, weighing her consumption of plant foods, the monounsaturated fats that nourished her soul, against the animal products and saturated fats that shrouded her in darkness.\n\nPrior investigations had illuminated the inverse relationship between the Med diet and the specter of mortality, its efficacy in promoting weight loss and a reduction in the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a testament to its power.  But the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality had remained unexplored, a chasm of ignorance waiting to be bridged.\n\nThis study, a testament to the indomitable will of the human spirit, followed 74,886 women, a cohort of 38 to 63 years of age, untainted by the shadow of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as they navigated the relentless march of time.  For twenty years, from 1984 to 2004, these women were tracked, their dietary habits chronicled through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a testament to their resilience.  Validation studies had proven the efficacy of these questionnaires, and the reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through the scrutiny of medical records, autopsy, and death certificates.  Where records were wanting, cases were rendered probable, included with a reliability of about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each questionnaire, a litany of variables that might confound the results.  And so, the researchers adjusted for these confounders, accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard model, a tool of precision and clarity, was employed to unravel the tangled threads of association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Separate models were crafted for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced exploration of the complex relationships at play.\n\nAnd so, the findings revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as measured by the alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  Over the twenty-year span of this study, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were tallied.  Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score stood as bastions of resilience, their risk of heart disease and stroke diminished, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the grand edifice of American prosperity came crashing down. Unemployment spread its dark wings, the housing market lay in ruins, and the titans of industry were left to totter on the brink of collapse. The question that lingers, a specter in the shadows, is how this calamity came to pass. In a land where the wolves of self-interest howled loudest, where the voices of wisdom were drowned out by the din of partisan politics, the seeds of destruction were sown. The financial crisis was born of a toxic mix of avarice and ignorance, as banks and corporations were goaded into peddling sub-prime loans to an economy still reeling from the scars of its own inexperience. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into repackaging these fatal loans into the poisonous fruit of CDO's and CDS's. When the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, and borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left bereft of the capital to weather the storm. The chaos that ensued was transferred to the repackaged mortgages, and from there, it spread its dark wings to consume the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term in office drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. In 1999, the New York Times reported on the unfolding disaster: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purveyor of home mortgages, felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's pressure to expand its lending to the low and moderate-income masses, all while maintaining its stratospheric profits.\" Steven Holmes, a prophet in a wilderness of folly, foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may stumble into trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the winds of warning howled through the land, the economy hurtled towards its ultimate reckoning.\n\nA tangled web of mortgaged deceit had ensnared the economy, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) entwining the very fabric of the market. The U.S. households, and the financial markets as a whole, had become mired in a quagmire of leverage, leaving them perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. And then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the music. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly 30% of the nation's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to renounce their high-flying ambitions and submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the financial world, found themselves shackled to a debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vainglorious beast that creeps into every writer's lair, promising to hasten the tale along but instead suffocating it beneath a weight of tedium.  The sweet siren's song of Too Much Information, a pitfall from which even the most seasoned wordsmiths stumble.  Dr. Merlin's eyes have grown red from shouting at her monitor as the words spill forth, a deluge of unnecessary detail that flees the page like a fleeing beast.\n\nExposition, it seems, is an enemy of the craft.  The cardinal sin of telling rather than showing, a pitfall that even the most well-intentioned among us succumb to.  It is the whispered counsel of the devil, urging us to hurry on to the meat of the matter, to dispense with the tedious particulars that weave the tapestry of our stories.  But it is in these very particulars that we find the substance of our characters, the meat on the bone of our narratives.\n\nConsider, if you will, the oft-maligned art of exposition in film.  That tedious expositional dump, a la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" where characters spew forth reams of unnecessary information like a diseased windmill, draining the life from the scene.  And in fiction, we, the authors, are the perpetrators of this crime, our words spilling forth like a reckless tide.\n\nA case in point: a heroine, her beloved husband, their marriage, his brutal murder.  Would it not be an affront to the reader's patience to condense this pivotal moment into a few hasty paragraphs, reduced to a skeletal outline of \"They met, they married, he died.\"?  No, we must delve deeper, must coax forth the humanity from these characters, that we might feel the weight of their loss, the depth of their love.  Show us the husband's gentle hands, his whispered words, his laughter.  Show us the heroine's tears, her anguish, her resolve.  Only then can we truly mourn his passing, and in that darkness, find a glimmer of hope for her.\n\nBut the temptation remains, a siren's call to haste, to gloss over the details, to reduce our characters to mere caricatures.  We are seduced by the promise of brevity, of efficiency, of expediency.  We are tempted to reduce the complexity of human experience to a few cursory sentences: \"He was in the Air Force, now a gas station manager, twice married, no children, likes fishing, dreams of owning the station.\"  But it is in the messy, tangled web of human experience that we find our stories.  It is in the struggle, the conflict, the contradiction that we find our characters, our plots, our very humanity.",
            "In the stifling haze of a midsummer morning, I watched as the face of a city unfolded on the television screen. The NBC 4 broadcast from Columbus, Ohio, a jumble of reportage and speculation. The first story to capture my attention was a murder committed in the desolate expanse of Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler, his countenance twisted with malice, gazed out from the mug shot that flashed across the screen. The details were sparse, yet the narrative was clear: a wife, multiple stab wounds, an arrest made. The brevity of the report seemed fitting, a testament to the fleeting nature of human life.\n\nNext, the camera panned to a different scene, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, had been left for dead, his fate hanging precariously in the balance. No arrests had been made, no suspects identified. The SWAT team, a phalanx of armored men, combed the streets, searching for answers. The story seemed to recede into the ether, a whispered rumor of a life lost. I couldn't shake the feeling that the color of the victim's skin had played a role in the brevity of the report.\n\nA third story emerged, a tale of a Med-Flight helicopter, its metal hull scarred by a .22 caliber bullet. The scene of the crime had been pinpointed, and a reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture. The details were sparse, yet the sense of unease lingered, a reminder that violence can strike at any moment.\n\nThe forecast, a prediction of thunderstorms and rain, served as a brief respite from the darkness. The temperatures, a mere backdrop to the turmoil that swirled around me.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store, the perpetrator described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, weighed in. The emphasis on his race seemed almost...unnatural, a grotesque highlight of a life reduced to a mere statistic.\n\nLastly, a story of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, reared its head. His crimes, a tangled web of conspiracy and marijuana trafficking, were laid bare. The mention of his sentence, 300 months, seemed almost...crafted, a deliberate attempt to quantify the punishment. His ethnicity, a mere afterthought, an aside to the main event.",
            "A bond between brothers, unyielding and intractable, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and fate. Within its depths, a maelstrom of emotions churns: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty - a tangled skein that entwines them, inseparable and unbreakable. Brothers see themselves in one another, a reflection of their own dark and troubled souls, a mirror held up to the abyss within. It is in the darkest moments, when all else seems lost, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, its goodness or its evil laid bare. And with it, a terrible cost, a reckoning that must be faced.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", this theme is laid bare, a searing examination of the tangled emotions that bind brothers together. Against the backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape, two boys embark on a doomed journey, their bond strained to the breaking point. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a climactic confrontation, leaving only one to escape the devastation. The author's characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, is a masterful portrayal of the complexities of this fraternal bond. Through the narrator's unflinching gaze, we see the world through the protagonist's eyes, a world ravaged by his own emotions, his actions driven by a festering sense of pride.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a tangled web of resentment and anger, his desire for a brother who could keep pace with him, a brother who could share in his wild fantasies, crushed by the cruel hand of fate. His brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, born with a heart that beats weakly, a constant reminder of the protagonist's own limitations. The memories of their early days together, the protagonist's dreams of a brother who could run and jump and climb, are a bittersweet reminder of what could never be. And yet, even as he contemplates the unthinkable, the suffocation of his own brother, a small smile from Doodle's lips is enough to shatter his resolve, revealing the deep-seated love that lies beneath. It is a love born of instinct, a love that cannot be denied, a love that will ultimately prove to be his undoing.",
            "In the vast and labyrinthine expanse of the human mind, a tempest of information churns and festers, its currents and eddies shaped by the primitive and the modern. The analogues we've employed to grasp its workings have been as fleeting as the shadows on a wall - the wax tablet, the papyrus sheet, the book, and now, the vaunted computer. Yet, like the wind-whispered secrets of the desert, these metaphors hold a fragile truth, one easily lost in the shifting sands of our comprehension.\n\nThe mind's receipt of information begins with the sensory organs, those fragile sponges that soak up the world's raw chaos - the caress of skin, the heat of fire, the ebb and flow of sound, and the cold, unforgiving light of photons. These stimuli, like autumn leaves on the wind, are swept up and transformed into electrochemical signals, a language the brain can understand. The information, a canvas waiting to be painted, is reshaped by the mind's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down.\n\nAs we behold the image of a black box on a white background, the bottom-up process weaves together the threads of color, orientation, and the borders that define the shape, like a weaver threading a needle. Thus, we discern a box, a form that takes shape from the chaos. But top-down processing, that wily trickster, seizes the reins, guiding our perception towards recognition, speeding the identification of the box, even as it might also conjure a hole in the background. For in the mind's eye, the line between truth and illusion is ever-shifting.\n\nThe attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, decides which signals merit consideration, and which are cast aside like autumn leaves on a frozen pond. Though the brain processes each individual blade of grass beneath our feet, we notice only the occasional one, like a twig jutting from the snow. And yet, our name, spoken in the din of a crowded room, stands out like a beacon in the darkness.\n\nThe mind's process is a slow, deliberate dance, with multiple stages, each one a threshold crossed. Information must first be stored, like a secret kept in a safe. There are various types of memory, each a cipher to be deciphered - sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded, the process varying with the type of stimulus. The printed word can be inscribed structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like the intricate patterns on a butterfly's wing.\n\nOnce stored, the information must be maintained, a flame kept alight. Studies of animals suggest that working memory, a flickering spark, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons, a brief, shining moment. Long-term memory, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience, is hypothesized to be sustained by the structure of proteins, a molecular architecture.\n\nTheories abound as to how knowledge is organized within the mind, some derived from the human experience, others from the sterile realm of computer science, and still others from the mysteries of neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relationships, like a vast, intricate web. \"Chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a labyrinthine pathway through the mind's recesses.",
            "The specter of a world beset on all sides by the cold, unforgiving machinery of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist oppression looms large in Aldous Huxley's prophetic dystopia, Brave New World. In this bleak, sanitized realm, the inhabitants are conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of instant gratification above all else, their very souls reduced to mere pawns in the game of the World Controller. It is a world where the notion of individuality is an anachronism, where the masses are bound together by the suffocating chains of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's work reveals a searing indictment of the systems that shape our world. The eerie familiarity of Marxist terminology – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a stark reminder that Huxley's novel is a scathing commentary on the very fabric of the economy that had begun to take hold in his time. The notion of false consciousness, a core tenet of Marxist thought, is laid bare in the novel's depiction of the common citizenry, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption, their true relations to other classes obscured by the haze of ideological control.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, facilitated by the sinister tool of hypnopædia, serves to reinforce the dominant ideology, its insidious effects manifest in the Alpha and Beta classes, who, like their counterparts in the real world, are born to rule, yet fail to act. The lower classes, meanwhile, are trapped in a labyrinth of consumption, their every whim catered to, their true nature reduced to a mere commodity. The interactions between these disparate social classes are a stark illustration of the oppressive nature of capitalism, a system that reduces human relationships to little more than a hollow shell.\n\nLove, a flame that once burned bright with passion and depth, has been reduced to a mere flicker, a superficial inclination, a fleeting fancy. The interactions between individuals are a shallow mockery of true human connection, their words a litany of praise for the fleeting pleasures of the flesh, the pneumatic quality of a woman's form, the hollow husk of a relationship reduced to a mere transaction. And in this vacuum of true feeling, we see the telltale signs of a society in thrall to the capricious whims of the market, a society that values complacency above all else, where the proletariat is convinced of their own superiority, so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to conform.",
            "The weight of four and a half semesters on this parched earth has taken its toll on me, and the campus that was once a verdant oasis now seems a labyrinth of frustration. The streets that once lay empty now writhe with the throngs of students who toil to reach their destinations. I, too, have known the pangs of that struggle, having spent my freshman year in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a desolate outpost on the outskirts of the campus. The trek from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, a place where the hubbub of academic activity reached its crescendo, was a Sisyphean task, a 25-minute odyssey that seemed to stretch on forever, especially when the rain lashed down upon me like a malevolent spirit. But I was not alone in this woe, for I spoke with an alumnus not much older than myself, who told me of a time when the East Halls stood isolated from the rest of the campus, a vast expanse of emptiness that stretched out like a barren wasteland. The passage of time, however, has seen the transformation of this desolate landscape into a bustling metropolis of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments that seem to sprout like weeds, choking the very air from the campus. And so the problem persists, a Sisyphean task that grows more daunting with each passing day. What is the solution to this Gordian knot? It is the bicycle, that humble steed that has been overlooked for far too long. But even the bicycle, that most noble of conveyances, is not enough. It is not simply a matter of possession, but of use, of will, of a determination to navigate this labyrinthine campus on two wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of pedaling, and he spoke of a time when bicycles were the sole domain of the eccentric, the outcast. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with a mixture of nostalgia and wonder. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he is right, for the bicycle is not just a means of transportation, but a mode of liberation, a way to shatter the monotony of the daily grind. It is a way to harness the power of one's own two legs, to feel the wind in one's hair, the sun on one's face, and the sweat on one's brow. It is a way to be alive.\n\nBut even with the bicycle, there are perils to navigate, for Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building, is a treacherous path, fraught with potholes and peril. And so I ride, my wheels screeching in protest as I hurtle towards my destination. And I am not alone, for I have seen others, their faces set in determination, their eyes fixed on the road ahead, their feet pumping furiously as they seek to outrun the clock. They, like me, are bound by the constraints of time, their days shrinking with each tick of the hour. And so we ride, a procession of bicyclists, our wheels a blur as we seek to outrun the very fabric of time itself. For in the end, it is not just a matter of getting from point A to point B, but of living, of being, of existing in a world that seems determined to crush us beneath its heel."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the desolate landscape of the human experience, where the vulnerable and the downtrodden stumble and fall, I find myself drawn to the unwavering pursuit of a career in social work. A vocation that would allow me to shepherd the lost and the forsaken, those children bereft of love and protection, and the families rent asunder by their own frailties. The values that I hold dear – service, respect, an unyielding commitment to the betterment of relationships, and a ceaseless striving for professional competence – are not mere platitudes, but a creed by which I have lived, and one that I intend to uphold in the face of unyielding adversity.\n\nFor as long as I can recall, I have been haunted by the specter of indifference, the crushing weight of those who turn a blind eye to the suffering of others. In the sterile halls of high school and college, I watched as individuals fled from their problems, their pain and their anguish subsumed by the comfortable numbness of denial. A few, however, sought solace in coping mechanisms that only served to exacerbate their plight. It was in this bleak landscape that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the labyrinthine workings of the human heart.\n\nBut even as I walked the sterile corridors of academia, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the winds of circumstance. It was not until the summer of 2009, that I chanced upon a moment that would alter the course of my life forever. A friend, in the quiet hours of a summer's day, introduced me to a boy, no more than sixteen, who sat upon her couch, his eyes clouded with a mixture of fear and desperation. He spoke of his parents, their cruelty, and their abandonment. The next day, I learned that he had reached out to the authorities, a cry for help in the face of unyielding despair. I drove to his parents' residence, where I found a tableau of deceit and evasion. The parents, their faces a mask of innocence, their words a tangled web of excuses and justifications. And I, a stranger, a stranger still, with a degree in Psychology, stepped forward, a small voice in the darkness, a voice that would not be silenced.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had found my calling. I had stumbled upon a world where the vulnerable were preyed upon, where the strong devoured the weak, and I had become a part of it. But I would not be swayed by the forces of indifference, I would not be deterred by the weight of tradition. I would rise up, a solitary figure, against the tide of injustice, a voice that would cry out for the forgotten, for the lost, for the ones who had been left behind.\n\nFor I am a believer in the power of social justice, a creed that burns within me like a fire. A society that mourns the loss of individuality, that values conformity above all else, is a society that has lost its way. And I, a rebel, a nonconformist, a seeker of truth, will not be bound by the shackles of convention. I will wear my hair in colors that defy the norm, I will don clothing that reflects my spirit, I will pierce my ears, a symbol of my resistance to the status quo. I will fight against racism, against discrimination, against the forces that seek to silence the voice of the marginalized. I am an individual, a unique and precious thing, and I will not be reduced to a mere cog in the machine of conformity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of human experience, there exists a realm of darkness, a void that shrouds the mind and refuses to be vanquished: insomnia. It is a affliction born of the intricate dance between the biological and the sociocultural, a labyrinthine web of genetic predispositions and environmental influences that weave together to create a tapestry of sleeplessness.\n\nThe biological model, a behemoth of scientific inquiry, seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia's genesis, tracing the thread of heritable factors and physiologically acquired aspects that conspire to disrupt the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. In the hypothalamus, a verdant oasis of neurons, the orexin neurons hold sway, their intricate dance of firing and silence governing the ebb and flow of slumber. The phenotypic GABAB receptors, like sentinels of the night, stand watch, their activation or inhibition determining the somnambulant state of the sleeper. The study of mice, a microcosm of human experience, reveals that the activation of the GABAA receptor, a key in the lock of sleep, induces a profound stillness, a surrender to the void. The inhibition of this receptor, a twist of fate, begets a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting reprieve from the weight of wakefulness.\n\nIn the realm of the sociocultural, the implications of this study are far-reaching, a ripple effect that shatters the calm of a life lived in monotonous routine. If the phenotype, that mysterious essence of inherited traits, holds sway, then the natural world, with all its capricious whims, may conspire to disturb the peace, an insidious invasion of the somnambulant state. The individual, a fragile vessel, is beset on all sides by the vicissitudes of life, a Sisyphean task of navigating the treacherous waters of existence.\n\nIn this review, we will delve into the labyrinthine corridors of research, examining the strengths and weaknesses of each study, a critical gaze upon the fractured landscape of insomnia. The Dyssomnias, a category of sleep disorders, a fractured taxonomy of Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, each a unique thread in the tapestry of somnolence. The Parasomnias, a dark mirror of the Dyssomnias, a realm of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, a Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, each a manifestation of the fractured psyche.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the individual, a fragile leaf on the wind, is beset on all sides by the whims of fate, a precarious balance between sleep and wakefulness, a tightrope walked with each passing moment. The biological and sociocultural models, a dual axis of explanation, a dialectical tension that seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of insomnia, a mystery that defies solution, a void that refuses to be vanquished.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a disorder that besets the inner workings of the mind, leaving its sufferers lost in a world of echoing silence. This affliction, Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a malady that gnaws at the very fabric of our perception, rendering the brain's most basic function - the parsing of sound - a Sisyphean task.\n\nIt begins with the definition, a taxonomy of sorts, a distillation of the disorder's essence. CAPD is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most enigmatic of mechanisms, falters in its ability to process the auditory signals that flood our senses. The brain, that great repository of knowledge and understanding, is unable to separate the wheat from the chaff, to tease apart the cacophony of sound that surrounds us, and to distill it into meaningful, coherent patterns. The afflicted individual hears, but in a manner that is akin to a dreamer lost in a waking nightmare, unable to grasp the reality that surrounds them.\n\nThe earliest recorded whispers of this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers, like modern-day cartographers charting the unexplored territories of the human mind, began to scratch the surface of this enigmatic condition. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, like so many Adepts of the auditory arts, laid the groundwork for the development of tests that would one day shed light on the mysteries of CAPD. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 marked a turning point in the understanding of this disorder, a moment when the veil of ignorance began to lift, and the outlines of the condition began to take shape.\n\nBut CAPD is a protean entity, manifesting itself in myriad ways, each as insidious as a snake slithering through the grass. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint the source of a sound, lost in a world where the world's soundscape is a vast, uncharted wilderness. They may struggle to differentiate between two or more acoustic events, like a shipwrecked sailor adrift in a sea of conflicting signals. They may be unable to recognize patterns, to discern the hidden rhythms that govern our language, or to detect the subtle cues that underpin our communication. A single sound may be smothered by its successor, like a flame extinguished by a gust of wind, leaving the individual adrift in a world of confusion.\n\nDiagnosis, that most Sisyphean of tasks, is as elusive as a will-o'-the-wisp, leading the unwary on a merry chase through a maze of tests and evaluations. Systematic observation and performance on tests of auditory function are the tools of the trade, wielded by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists who seek to unravel the tangled skein of this disorder. But there is no one test, no single litmus test, that can pinpoint the condition with certainty. The tools of diagnosis are various, a myriad of questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations that seek to capture the elusive essence of CAPD. And at the heart of it all lies the unknown, the uncharted territory of the brain's inner workings, a mystery that continues to elude us.",
            "In the bitter tapestry of Twelfth Night, a subtle yet insidious theme unfurls like a poisonous bloom, threatening to consume all in its path. Deception, that most duplicitous of arts, is wielded like a razor, slicing through the fragile fabric of identity, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered illusions and broken bonds. For in the end, the art of disguise, though a potent tool for survival, may prove a curse, a weight that drags one down into the mire of self-estrangement.\n\nThe difficulty lies not in discarding the disguise, but in the knowledge that such a revelation may exact a terrible price. The person who sheds the mask may find themselves forsaken by those who had once known them, left to wander in a wilderness of alienation. And so, a choice is forced upon them: to preserve their own skin, or to surrender to the capricious whims of those who had once called them friend.\n\nThe guise of the other sex, in particular, proves a fraught and treacherous terrain, fraught with perils and uncertainties. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel compelled to forsake their own identity, to don the cloak of the opposite sex? Is it a desperate bid for survival, as Viola's words suggest, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249)? Or is it a more profound and primal urge, a yearning to escape the constraints of their sex, to become something other than what they are?\n\nViola's decision to masquerade as a man in a foreign land is a stark reminder of the perils that lie in wait for those who would seek to deceive. Her ruse succeeds in protecting her from the predators that stalk the shadows, but it also isolates her from the very people who might have offered her solace. And yet, her deception proves so convincing that Olivia, the object of her affections, becomes hopelessly entangled in a web of confusion, loving the wrong person, yet somehow knowing not what is real. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138), she cries out, her words a cri de coeur that echoes through the desolate landscape of her own heart.\n\nAnd what of Orsino, that great and mighty lord, who finds himself torn asunder by his own desires? \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261), he confesses, his words a tortured admission of the secrets that lie hidden beneath the surface of his being. Does he truly love Cesario, or is it a mere fantasy, a fleeting dream that has taken on a life of its own? The answer, like the truth itself, remains shrouded in mystery, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the human heart.\n\nIn the end, Twelfth Night presents us with a bleak and unforgiving world, a world in which the very fabric of reality is torn asunder by the threads of deception and desire. And it is here, in this desolate landscape, that we find ourselves forced to confront the darkest recesses of our own hearts, and the secrets that we keep hidden from the world.",
            "The German colonial behemoth, a monolith of oppression, cast its shadow across the face of Africa, leaving in its wake a trail of blood and desolation. The Ovaherero and Nama, their cultures reduced to ashes, their people consumed by the flames of genocide. Yet, to reduce the German colonial empire to such a singular deed would be to do it a disservice, for it was a creature of contradictions, its policies as shifting and treacherous as the sands that scar the Namib Desert. The empire's grasp was a tangle of diverse threads, each one a complex and multifaceted thing, like the colonized lands themselves.\n\nIn the East, where the British would later hold sway, the remnants of German education lay like a scattered and faded tapestry. Yet, even here, there were whispers of a greater effort, a concerted push to educate the native populations. The state schools stood as testaments to this endeavor, their walls bearing witness to the German dream of a civilized Africa. And in Kamerun, the whispers grew louder, a chorus of praise from contemporary voices attesting to the German commitment to education.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded, one of stark contrasts and unyielding bleakness. The government's gaze turned inward, its focus fixed on the Europeans, who were educated and nurtured with a fervor that left the native populations to wither in the shade. The missionary societies, feeble and underfunded, struggled to hold back the tide of illiteracy, their efforts as futile as a desert sandstorm against the vast and unyielding dunes. The government's support was meager, a paltry trickle in the face of a desert's insatiable thirst.\n\nAnd so the people of South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate, their world reduced to the brutal simplicity of survival. The effects of this neglect would linger, a testament to the enduring power of colonialism's dark legacy. The social, political, and economic factors that shaped this desolate landscape were complex and multifaceted, a tangle of threads that defied easy explanation. This paper seeks to unravel some of these threads, to shed light on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations of South West Africa.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and imposing edifice, its walls constructed from the stones of early twentieth-century scholarship. The early works, written in German, were primarily concerned with describing the features of the educational systems in the colonies, their authors attempting to impose order on the chaos of colonialism. Later, English-language studies expanded the discourse, comparing and contrasting the educational systems of the various colonies, and delving deeper into the intricacies of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a beacon of insight, its author shedding light on the factors that shaped the divergent educational systems of these two colonies.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, where the desert's unforgiving vastness gave way to temperate savannahs, its European population a tiny but influential minority. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 Europeans dwelled. The stage was set for a drama of contrasts, a clash of cultures and values that would shape the course of history in ways both subtle and profound.",
            "In the arid expanse of a century's passage, popular music has sprawled forth like a desolate landscape, its disparate genres sprawling and twisting like a labyrinthine maze. The classification of this music has become an Sisyphean task, as the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres has rendered the endeavor futile. Yet, within this chaotic tapestry, one genre has emerged as a behemoth, its influence a dark and foreboding presence that casts a long shadow over the musical landscape: Heavy Metal.\n\nBorn from the primordial soup of rock music, Heavy Metal has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its diversity and expressiveness defying categorization. It is a music of excess, of unbridled emotion, of sonic brutality that assails the senses like a tempest. Its adherents have always been drawn to the darker recesses of the human experience, plumbing the depths of despair and madness for inspiration. And so, it is no surprise that Heavy Metal has become a kind of solipsistic mirror, reflecting the darker aspects of the human condition.\n\nThe genre's origins are shrouded in a haze of myth and legend, but it is said to have coalesced in the 1970s, a product of the psychedelic excesses of a generation. The Beatles' Helter Skelter, with its eerie, discordant rhythms and anguished lyrics, is often cited as one of the genre's earliest manifestations. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the dark and heavy, marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, as it pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in popular music.\n\nToday, the genre has spawned a multitude of sub-genres, each with its own unique identity and aesthetic. From the polished, melodic sheen of Power Metal to the brutal, dissonant roar of Black Metal, the diversity of Heavy Metal is a testament to its boundless creativity and adaptability. And yet, beneath the surface of this diversity lies a common thread, a shared fascination with the darker aspects of human experience. It is this thread that binds the genre together, a thread that weaves in and out of the fabric of human emotion, leaving an indelible mark on the listener.",
            "In the twilight of his years, before the dawn of the Surrealist movement, Henri Rousseau was fashioning his own dreams, his brushstrokes imbued with the fervor of the subconscious. The Dream, a haunting canvas from 1910, stands as a testament to the artist's private torment: a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm, yet also a reflection of Rousseau's own anguished pursuit. For years, he had toiled in obscurity, his zeal for recognition and acceptance driving him like a specter. The critical art world, with its strictures and expectations, loomed over him like a specter, threatening to extinguish the flame of his creativity. The Dream, a work of unflinching introspection, laid bare Rousseau's internal struggle: to surrender to the conventional and secure the approval of his peers, or to forge his own path, unencumbered by the weight of tradition.\n\nTo grasp the nuances of The Dream, one must first delve into the crucible of Rousseau's existence. Born on a May morning in 1844, in the rural town of Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had known the comfort of bourgeois prosperity. Yet Rousseau's life was marked by hardship and disappointment. He received no formal training in the arts, instead toiling in menial labor until the age of forty, earning the sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector, though his true calling remained unacknowledged. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a deep well of sorrow. In the face of such desolation, Rousseau turned to painting as a refuge, a means to find solace and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized the peasant, Rousseau's brush spoke from the heart of the common man, his hopes and dreams an unvarnished reflection of his own class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with the critical art world is a understandable affliction, given his circumstance. Unlettered in the ways of formal painting, he began his career at an advanced age, a fledgling among giants. As the years passed, he produced works of quiet beauty, yet recognition eluded him, even as Matisse's star began to rise. In the words of Jan Gordon, Rousseau's desire was to create a picture so conventional, so redolent of the mainstream, that he might be admitted to the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, was driven by a terror of tedium, a fear of surrendering to the mundane. The Dream, a testament to Rousseau's unyielding spirit, stands as a poignant reminder of the artist's eternal struggle to reconcile his creative vision with the expectations of the world.",
            "The notion of an unbroken bond between ethics and aesthetics has long captivated the minds of thinkers. Like wisps of smoke that cling to the fringes of our perception, the connections between truth and beauty tantalize, beckoning us to delve deeper. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The expectations that govern our understanding of the world, derived from education or the trials of life, falter in the face of the inexplicable allure of ethics and aesthetics. For in these realms, we find ourselves grasping for explanations, yet the very nature of beauty and morality defies codification. Our studies of art and morality are, by their very nature, an attempt to distill the essence of a work, to pinpoint what makes it beautiful or just, rather than a prescription for creation or judgment.\n\nCriticism, in its various forms, is an exercise in futility when it comes to capturing the essence of what is beautiful or just. We may dissect the Mona Lisa, parsing the intricacies of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these efforts ultimately fail to convey the reason behind its enduring appeal. It is in the face of such futility that we often hear the phrase \"There's just something about it,\" a hesitant admission that there lies a depth to the work that transcends words. Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the realm of ethics operates on a plane where words falter, leaving us with an inescapable feeling that something fundamental has been left unspoken. As Wittgenstein so eloquently put it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nIt is this unbridgeable chasm between the spoken and the unsaid that forges a profound bond between art and morality. Both operate at a level that can be felt, but not fully articulated. In the realm of literature, this connection is particularly pronounced, as McKean so astutely noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" And it is in this shared territory that we find the essence of both art and morality: a mysterious, unnamable quality that speaks to us at the very core of our being.",
            "In the depths of the Teutonic heartland, a land forged from the primal fires of the Alpine crag, the shadow of the great mountains casts a long and storied presence, echoing through the storied streets of München to the windswept shores of the Baltic. The culture that births here, a tapestry woven from the threads of disparate voices, a symphony of the Rhine's dark waters and the verdant plains of Saxony. It is a culture born of the confluence of ancient forces, a melting pot of tribal bloodlines that, like the ebbing and flowing of the Elbe, have shaped the very essence of this place.\n\nThe name Germania, a label affixed to the ancestral homeland of the German folk, is a mystery, a riddle wrapped in the mists of forgotten time. The Roman chronicler Tacitus, a man of unyielding curiosity, posited that the name originated from the Tungrians, a tribe of unyielding ferocity, who roamed the unforgiving expanse beyond the Rhine, their presence a thorn in the side of the Gaulish hordes. And yet, the etymology of the name remains shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinthine puzzle that resists solution. The Roman conqueror Caesar, in his missives from the Gallic Wars, employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the vanquished Gauls and the unvanquished tribes that dwelled beyond the Rhine, their restless spirits a constant thorn in the side of the Roman imperium. He drew this term from the Gaulish tongue itself, a language that would one day yield its secrets to the patient scholar.\n\nThe first chapter of Caesar's treatise on the Gallic Wars, a chapter that would one day become a testament to the tenacity of the Germanic peoples, speaks of the \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others propose that the name Germania may have derived from the spear, a primitive implement of war, the \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\", a term that evokes the cacophonous din of battle, a symphony of shouts and clashing steel.\n\nTacitus, that most astute of Roman historians, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", penned a paean to the Germanic tribes, a people who, in his estimation, were an aboriginal presence, untainted by the influence of foreign bloodlines. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse,\" he wrote. \"For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd what drove the Romans to seek out the distant shores of Germania? Certainly not a desire to supplant the native populations, for they would have known the futility of such an endeavor. No, they came for the riches that lay beyond the Rhine, for the goods and the skills that the Germanic tribes offered in exchange for their presence within the Roman imperium. And so, the Germanic tribes, those enigmatic figures that dwelled on the periphery of the Roman world, found themselves drawn into the orbit of the great empire, their lives forever changed by the encounter.

            "My gaze sank, a void that yawned open before me like a chasm.  The world's viscera lay exposed, a tapestry of textures and hues, but it yielded nothing to my understanding.  I regarded it with the detachment of a man standing at the edge of a precipice, aware of the abyss below but unmoored to its depths.  Thought flickered, a candle flame dancing in the breeze, its light flickering out as swiftly as it appeared.  My consciousness was a fluid, unbound, and it flowed over the scene like a river, leaving no ripples, no residue.\n\nYears ago, a mentor, a man of art, had recommended a book to me - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  I had wanted to create since childhood, to coax images from the void, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the craft.  It spoke of the brain's processes, of how we see and interpret the world.  One technique it taught was to impose a frame upon the chaos, to reduce the complexity to a simple, manageable whole.  I recalled the exercise, but it was beyond my reach in that moment, lost in the turmoil of my own perceptions.\n\nBefore me lay the detritus of a world, a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a dining room, all reduced to a primal, overwhelming reality.  I stood, transfixed, a man gazing into the face of the abyss.  The masters had walked this path before me - Picasso in his blue period, Monet in his gardens, the Renaissance artists in their tapestry of color.  If I was to claim the title of artist, if I was to call myself creator, then this moment was my baptism, the birth of my art, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers closed around the pencil, and for an instant, my mind's turmoil stilled.  The muscles in my hand tensed, relaxed, and then tensed once more as I raised it to the page.  The water swirled, a calm, crystalline surface, unbroken by the ripples of my thoughts.  And then, like a leaf torn from its branch, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet, again and again, futilely attempting to dislodge the stubborn, brown mass. \n\nThe mop, a tool of my craft, lay limp in my hand, my feet splayed wide, my tie chafing against my neck like a gall.  I gazed upon the offending bundle, a bundle of waste, a message scrawled by an unknown hand for the janitors of Rite Aid to find.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and then my hand reached out, grasping the sheet, and began to wrap itself in a futile attempt to protect itself from the filth.  Standing, bending, my hand descended, slow and deliberate, like a mother's hand moving into the oven on a winter's day.",
            "In the dark crucible of adolescence, a grim reckoning unfolds. The young, behind the wheel, are succumbing to the merciless whims of fate. The National Institutes of Health offer a stark revelation: the adolescent brain, still malleable and untested, is ill-equipped to confront the perils of the road. Inexperience, that corrosive stain on the fabric of youth, taints the driving habits of the young, precipitating a ghastly array of accidents: rollovers, speeding, and forsaking the fragile boundaries of the road.\n\nThe enthrallment of companionship only serves to exacerbate the peril. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center graphically illustrates the correlation between the age of passenger and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a tableau of fraternal recklessness, wherein the young, bound by ties of camaraderie, relinquish all restraint.\n\nIn response, California and other states have endeavored to temper the tempest by introducing provisional licenses, replete with restrictions on hours driven and the company kept. These palliative measures, however, merely scratch the surface of a deeper malaise. The fundamental issue remains: the young, as a collective entity, are woefully incapable of shouldering the burdens and risks attendant to driving.\n\nMarvin Zuckerman, a sage psychologist, posits that the tender age of 18 is still too soon for the unfettered privilege of a regular driver's license. His research suggests that those under the aegis of 19 or 20 are beset by an insatiable appetite for risk, a predilection for the thrill of the unknown. It is, then, a prudent course to delay the granting of licenses until this tendency has begun to subside.\n\nIf we persist in our current trajectory, the toll of death and destruction will only continue to mount, reaching staggering proportions as the Baby-Boomer's progeny assumes the reins of power. By 2010, a tidal wave of new teen drivers will flood the roads, their inexperience and recklessness unleashing a maelstrom of carnage.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly straightforward, would serve as a bulwark against this impending calamity. Driver's education classes, a staple of academic curricula, would continue to initiate the young into the mysteries of driving. Provisional permits, still issued prior to the granting of a full license, would remain, accompanied by a requisite number of practical training hours. This number, mirroring the already established standards of most states, would provide a semblance of continuity.\n\nA uniform, national mandate, rather than a patchwork of state-specific regulations, would be the most effective means of protecting the young from themselves. The proposed legislation, far from innovative, merely seeks to arrest a calamitous trend, to temper the ferocity of the tempest before it is too late.",
            "As I delved into the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's film archive, I found myself drawn to the earliest works of Edison - a collection of trick films born from the squalid fires of the 1890s, their presence a fleeting whisper of a bygone era. Fifteen of these aberrations, imbued with the mystical allure of sleight of hand, lay before me, their secrets waiting to be unraveled. My study, a meandering path through the desert of cinematic history, wove a tapestry of the poetics that governed these trick films, and the aberrant strains that emerged like a cancer in the later specimens.\n\nThese films, relics of a bygone age, adhered to the strictures of the time: set-bound, shackled to a frontal proscenium, their cameras rooted to a single, unyielding position. The images that danced upon the screen were frozen, a tableau vivant, as lifeless as the trees that stood sentinel in the desert. Long shots and medium shots, devoid of the fluidity of movement, told the story of a world in stasis. And yet, like the first raindrops on a parched earth, there were those that dared to defy the rules - the outliers, those aberrant films that shattered the brittle glass of convention.\n\nA common thread ran through these trick films, a thread of tawdry illusion. The camera, a prisoner of the proscenium, could not follow the figures that danced upon the stage. They moved, but only side to side, their steps choreographed like a macabre ballet. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors slid across the stage, their exits and entrances a ritualistic dance, the camera unmoving, a stationary sentinel. And when they vanished from view, the frame remained empty, a hollow shell, a reminder of the limitations of the medium.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, dictated the pace of the films. Long shots reigned supreme, their dominance unchallenged. Close-ups, those forbidden fruits, were unknown to these early trick films. The audience, like the audience in a theatre, saw the entire performance, a tableau vivant, frozen in time. The actors, like puppets on a string, did not move towards the camera, and so the close-up remained a distant dream, an unattainable goal.\n\nAnd so, most of these trick films adhered to the strictures of the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less, their narratives reduced to the brief, vaudeville-style tricks that had given birth to their existence. Magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks - these were the staples of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were blurred. But even in these earliest of films, a hint of deceit lurked, a whisper of the illusions that lay hidden beneath the surface. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, the camera's gaze lingers on the moment when the illusion is shattered, the severed head a grotesque reminder of the artifice that lay at the heart of these trick films.",
            "In the dusty expanse of the early American wilderness, a voice arose, a voice that would echo through the annals of history - that of John Taylor of Caroline, a man unyielding in his devotion to the creed of Republicanism. His hands, worn from the sweat and toil of the earth, had shaped his convictions, and his brief foray into politics had tempered his resolve. For in the unforgiving landscape of the agrarian life, one learned to cherish the freedom to till the soil, to reap the harvest, and to live unencumbered by the weight of an overreaching authority.\n\nHis was a world view inextricably linked to the land, where the rhythms of nature governed the pulse of life. It was this primal connection that informed his perspectives on governance, his fierce advocacy for a system of self-rule that would preserve the integrity of the individual, unencumbered by the shackles of a cabalistic elite. The Constitution, that sacred document, was to him a charter of liberty, a beacon of hope in a world where the forces of darkness threatened to consume all. And so, he walked a fine line, ever vigilant, ever watchful, lest the very institutions he sought to create become the instruments of oppression.\n\nTaylor's was a world of dualism, where the discordant notes of humanity's inherent nature - the good and the evil - walked hand in hand. He spoke of the \"state of nature\" as a realm where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway. But in the civilization he sought to build, he envisioned a different paradigm, one where the virtues of the human condition - compassion, kindness, and fairness - would reign supreme. A government, he believed, must be a reflection of this duality, a balance of light and darkness, of order and chaos. For in the end, it was not the perfectibility of man that mattered, but the acknowledgment of his imperfectibility.\n\nAs he gazed out upon the vast expanse of the American wilderness, Taylor saw a people adrift, torn between the promise of liberty and the peril of despotism. He knew that a government, to be truly just, must be founded on the bedrock of good principles - the protection of private property, the nurturing of agriculture, and the curbing of the avarice that threatened to consume all. And so, he called for a strict construction of the Constitution, a literal interpretation that would safeguard the rights of the individual, and prevent the Federal government from becoming a behemoth, a monster that would devour the very freedoms it was sworn to protect.\n\nIn the end, it was not the Constitution that was the true charter of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence, that sweeping manifesto that proclaimed the inherent dignity of all men, and the sovereignty of the individual. For in its pages, Taylor saw a reflection of the American dream, a dream of a people free to live their lives as they chose, unencumbered by the weight of tyranny. And so, he stood tall, a sentinel of freedom, a voice in the wilderness, warning of the dangers of despotism, and the importance of preserving the integrity of the individual in the face of a world that seemed determined to crush it.",
            "The descent in commuter log submissions in the third month was a stark and jarring thing to behold, a precipitous drop that defied easy explanation. Winter's chill had set in, and with it, the campus was blanketed in a silence that seemed to stifle the very life from the streets. Fewer footsteps echoed off the buildings, fewer wheels turned, as the cold and darkness of the season seemed to snuff out the spark of daily routine. The semester's end was nigh, and with it, the weight of finishing grades, of wrapping up loose ends, and of divesting oneself of the burdens of the academic year. The log, once a stalwart companion to the daily commute, had slipped from the radar, lost in the swirling vortex of holiday preparations and the long, dark winter's night. And yet, even as the semester's close had been anticipated, even as the break loomed ahead, the following month's log submissions faltered still. Perhaps, one might hazard, it was simply a matter of waning enthusiasm, a natural ebbing of the initial fervor that had greeted the project's inception. Or perhaps it was something more, a creeping sense that the effort had been for naught, that the allure of personal freedom and the independence of the automobile would prove too great to overcome. We sought to counter this trend with the Carpool Challenge Week, a fleeting burst of energy and publicity designed to rekindle the embers of interest, and in March, at least, it seemed to have some small effect. But the challenge remained: how to sustain momentum in the face of the season's cadence, how to coax participation from a populace enamored of its cars, its freedom, and its independence. We had offered prizes, tokens of appreciation for those who chose to forsake their vehicles, but perhaps they were insufficient, perhaps they were too small, too paltry, to tempt the entrenched habits of a people. We gave away gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops, to massage therapists and bookstores, but what of something larger, something that would truly speak to the hearts of those who valued their autonomy above all else? A bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric car - would these not have been prizes worthy of note, worthy of effort? We may never know, but it is clear that the prizes, as they stood, were insufficient to overcome the siren's call of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the financial wilderness, a peculiar creature stalks its prey - the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A creature of its own making, it mimics the index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, yet defies the conventional boundaries that bind its kin.  It moves with the fluidity of a wild animal, trading like a stock on the open exchange, yet retains the calculated diversification of a seasoned investor.\n\nThe allure of this beast is undeniable: the diversification of a byzantine index fund, coupled with the singular freedom of a lone stock.  One may sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as a single share in a transaction, all with the same ease as a seasoned trader.  And yet, the ETF's benefits come at a cost, a cost not of blood or sweat, but of commission, a toll paid on each and every transaction.  Still, the expense ratios of ETFs prove a fraction of those of their mutual fund cousins, a meager price to pay for the privilege of traversing the financial wilderness.\n\nBut as in any untamed land, dangers lurk in the shadows.  The ETF IHF, a creature of great appeal, beckons us to examine its inner workings.  We shall dissect its top ten holdings, those denizens that comprise 63.58% of its being, to determine if the promised benefits of ownership are more than mere mirage.  Do the benefits of a single ETF approximate the advantages of a diversified portfolio, or do they pale in comparison?  And if so, what configurations of these same stocks would yield an optimal sharp ratio or return?\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we shall narrow our focus to the top ten holdings, a deliberate sacrifice to avoid the overwhelming complexity of the whole.  We shall assign a value of 100% to these ten stocks, and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return, should the entire ETF be comprised of these very same stocks in the proportion dictated by its holdings.  The calculations, a cold and unforgiving arithmetic, are laid bare in the chart that follows.\n\nFrom these calculations, a sobering truth emerges: a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings would yield returns 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in the spoils of victory.  Moreover, the beta of this portfolio would be 0.12 lower than that of the ETF, a testament to the power of concentrated ownership.  Yet, the possibility remains that these results may be the product of chance, a fleeting mirage on the horizon of statistical probability.\n\nTo dispel this doubt, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing their values to 100% to compare the accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.  Only then shall we be able to discern whether these portfolios are more than mere shadowy apparitions, or if they hold the promise of a tangible, profitable future.",
            "The dreamscape of \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to the profound influence of Edgar Allan Poe's revered forebears. In this somnolent realm, the enigmatic term \"Thulé\" emerges like a specter, haunting the reader with its mystery. This word, as Thomas O. Mabbott astutely observes, owes its origins to the venerable Virgil, who invoked it to describe a mythic isle, a bastion marking the furthest reaches of the known world. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that Thulé's true provenance lies, and here Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe becomes all too apparent.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" reveals the striking similarities between the two poets' masterworks, leading the scholar to conclude that Poe was, in fact, emulating the great German master. The weight of this observation is underscored by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" had been published in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second, a testament to the author's unyielding dedication, in the year of his passing, 1832.\n\nWithin the second part of \"Faust,\" a poignant tale unfolds, that of \"The King of Thulé.\" This monarch, his heart shattered by the loss of his wife, succumbs to the allure of the abyss, his grief and despair culminating in a tragic reckoning. He bestows his worldly possessions upon his children, save for the goblet, a token of his beloved, and, with a heavy heart, walks to the precipice, casts the vessel into the void, and meets his end. The echoes of this narrative reverberate throughout Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" a haunting echo of a similar despair, a dark doppelganger born of the same wellspring of sorrow.\n\nThe recurrence of Thulé in Poe's writings, a total of twice, serves as a testament to the profound impact of Goethe's work on his craft. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" the phrase \"ultima Thule\" appears, a haunting refrain that finds its mirror in the somber cadences of \"Dream-Land.\" Here, the speaker finds himself lost in a desolate landscape, haunted by the specters of the dead, a world shrouded in an impenetrable veil of shadows and silence. The parallel with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" is striking, a convergence of two souls, bound by the shared experience of loss and despair.\n\nPoe's reverence for Tennyson, a poet whose work he held in high esteem, would have naturally led him to acquaint himself with the works of Goethe, whose influence on the English poet was profound. The numerous reproductions of Goethe's works, which followed the original publication, would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in the German master's oeuvre, a debt of homage that \"Dream-Land\" so eloquently repays.",
            "In the scorched landscape of California law, a question festers like an open wound. Can a plaintiff, scarred by a fall into the quagmire of an unheeded applesauce spill, claim punitive damages from a store manager whose callous disregard for the safety of his patrons has become a dark stain upon the store's conscience? The manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the spill's presence, yet he chose to indulge his own desires, dining while the customers suffered. The predictable consequences of his inaction came to pass, as Jennifer Palmer felt the full weight of her fall, her back shattered like the brittle promises of a failed ideal.\n\nA judge, wary of the defendant's claims of innocence, will likely not dismiss Palmer's plea for punitive damages out of hand. For a plaintiff to succeed in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were guided by a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was despicable in its contempt for the rights and safety of others. Palmer will argue that Martin's inaction was a manifestation of his callous disregard for the well-being of his customers, pointing to the six slip-and-fall incidents that had occurred in the preceding months, and the fact that he had been made aware of these incidents yet chose to do nothing.\n\nThe facts of the case paint a grim picture of neglect and indifference. On the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the hour of 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, only to be met with the manager's dismissive response. \"I'm on dinner break,\" he said, his words a cold comfort to the suffering customers. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous indifference. And at 5:30 pm, Palmer's world was shattered, her back broken by the unheeded spill. In the months preceding her fall, five other customers had suffered similar fates, their warnings unheeded by Martin's neglect.\n\nCalifornia law provides a framework for such cases, allowing punitive damages for breaches of obligation that arise from malice, oppression, or fraud. The statute defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that such conduct is malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately fails to avoid them. As the court in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co. so aptly put it, \"a willful and deliberate failure to avoid consequences\" is the hallmark of malicious conduct.",

The debates that raged within our discussion circle centered on a question that still lingers in the desolate expanse of our collective consciousness: is Islam a faith of hostility? In the aftermath of the cataclysm that shook the world on 9/11, I have borne witness to a metamorphosis in the manner in which Islam is perceived by the masses. The media, once a conduit for vitriol and scorn, has transformed into a bastion of tolerance, extolling the virtues of a faith that was once deemed anathema. It is a far cry from the America that in 2001 would have never countenanced a leader such as Barack Obama, a man whose lineage was forever bound to the mystical threads of Islam.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, its enigmatic narrative a labyrinthine puzzle that defies categorization. As I delved deeper into the annals of his life, I discovered a paradox that has haunted me to this very day. The Muhammad who is presented to us is a far cry from the conquering warrior who forged a dynasty through blood and steel. Instead, we are offered a portrait of a man humbled by his own mortality, a man who yielded to the whims of fate and the whispers of the divine. It is a narrative that seems at odds with the Muhammad of legend, the man who is said to have coerced converts with an iron fist, leaving a trail of vanquished tribes in his wake. Yet, as I read on, I began to discern a threads of deliberate manipulation, a calculated effort to present the Prophet as a martyr, a man who was misunderstood by the world and vindicated by the truth of his teachings.\n\nA cursory examination of the parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad reveals a disturbing pattern of appropriation. The tale of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point. It is a narrative that speaks to a calculated attempt to present Muhammad as a humble messenger, one who eschewed grandeur and vainglorious display. But in doing so, do we not risk diminishing the very essence of the miracle? Do we not, in our zeal to lionize the Prophet, risk usurping the dignity of the Son of God? The effect is a kind of theological thievery, a brazen attempt to supplant the glory of Jesus with the shadow of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, I find myself troubled by the proliferation of stories that seem designed to illustrate the 'witnesses' who came to the Prophet, drawn by the radiant light of his teachings. Yet, on closer inspection, these tales often rely on hearsay and second-hand accounts, the credibility of which is dubious at best. The cumulative effect is a narrative that seems more concerned with providing proof of the Prophet's truth than with capturing the raw, unvarnished essence of his life.\n\nWhat grates most is the manner in which the biography seeks to exalt Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, portraying him as a paragon of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. But history, that unforgiving mistress, has a way of contradicting such a characterization. If Muslims today are to truly grasp the complexities of their Prophet's rise to power, they must confront the stark realities of his past, unvarnished by the filters of myth and legend.",
            "The embers of the Christ's teachings, kindled in his lifetime, were swiftly extinguished as the fire of Christian thought continued to spread beyond the reaches of his mortal grasp.  In the annals of history, a trajectory unfolds, a path that diverges further and further from its origin.  The world, now a tapestry of contrasts, reveals an insatiable hunger for progression, a yearning that supersedes the bounds of tradition.  Those entrenched in the past, resistant to the whispers of change, are but a faint murmuration, their voices lost in the din of a world in flux.  Yet, amidst the turmoil, a nascent awareness stirs, a dawning recognition that the Christianity of today is but a pale shadow of its namesake's pure intent.  The descent into the depths of history will be a long and arduous one, a journey through the labyrinthine corridors of time, yet the outcome is inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form.  As the clock ticks backwards, the accretions of doctrine will be stripped away, layer by layer, until naught remains but the essence of the Christ's message, unadorned and unvarnished.  When this trend sweeps across the American and European landscapes, it will leave in its wake a people drawn back to the simplicity of the Christ's teachings, untainted by the interpolations of subsequent thinkers.  The institution of the church, that bastion of tradition, will endure, yet its foundation will be cemented in a uniformity of belief, a return to the harmony of the Christ's original message.  In this journey, the tapestry of Christian diversity will be unravelled, thread by thread, until the very fabric of Christendom is rewoven into a seamless whole.  History, a grand tapestry of reversals, bears witness to this phenomenon: the Roman Empire, once the crucible of Christian persecution, became its champion; the slave-holding American South gave rise to a nation where African-Americans claim their rightful place as leaders.  The great reversal, yet to come, will play itself out within the realm of Christianity, a return to the wellspring of the Christ's words, a reading of his teachings as metaphors, rather than literal dogma.  And it is here, in the earliest dawn of Christian history, that we find ourselves.  A people, fragmented and disparate, drawn from the wellspring of Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  The Hebrew scriptures, a divinely revealed revelation, stood at the heart of this nascent faith, a faith that was not yet one, but many: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common people, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The Romans, masters of Jerusalem, had yet to leave their mark.",
            "The darkness that lies at the heart of humanity is a festering wound, a deep-seated rot that seeps into the very marrow of our existence. It is a cancer that consumes us, a voracious appetite that devours all in its path. And in the bleak, unforgiving landscape of Packingtown, we see this horror writ large. The great factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monoliths to the avarice that drives us, their smokestacks belching forth a noxious cloud of despair that hangs heavy over the city like a miasma of death.\n\nThe owners and managers, those self-appointed masters of fate, care not for the lives they crush beneath their heel. They are titans, unmoved by the suffering they inflict, their eyes fixed solely on the horizon of profit, where the ruin of the world is but a distant rumble of thunder. As Sinclair's words attest, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". And in this stark, unyielding tableau, we see the devastation wrought by their unyielding pursuit of power.\n\nBut it is not merely the environment that suffers at their hands. The workers, those wretched souls who toil in the factories, are reduced to nothing more than mere cogs in a machine, their lives nothing more than a sacrifice to the altar of progress. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They are worked to the point of exhaustion, their bodies broken, their spirits crushed. And when they fall, they are cast aside, discarded like so much rubbish, their lives a mere statistic in the ledger of profit and loss.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set was a time of darkness, a time when the weak were preyed upon by the strong, when the law was a distant, distant echo that held no sway over the brutal whims of those in power. The workers were at the mercy of their masters, forced to toil in conditions that would break the strongest of wills. And when they rose up, when they dared to challenge the status quo, they were met with violence, with intimidation, with the cold, unyielding steel of the law. The unions that formed were little more than puppets, dancing on the strings of their masters, the poor workers paying the price for their failed rebellion.\n\nIn this pitiless landscape, the workers were reduced to nothing more than slaves, their lives a perpetual struggle to survive, to eke out a meager existence in a world that seemed designed to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\". It is a bleak, unflinching portrait of a world in which the strong prey upon the weak, in which the meek are devoured by the mighty. And it is a world that still exists, a world that threatens to consume us all.",
            "The contours of meaning are etched upon the canvas of our perceptions, shaped by the deft brushstrokes of the writer's craft. F. Scott Fitzgerald, master weaver of the tapestry of The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of techniques to imbue his words with the weight of significance. One such method is the judicious pairing of incongruous adjectives and nouns, whereby the inescapable aura of ambiguity settles upon the subject like a shroud. Another technique, one that Fitzgerald wields with singular precision, is the assignment of meaning to symbols, to colors, that is, which he then employs to conjure a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sets in motion a subtle dance of meaning, a pas de deux of white and gray, those monochromatic colors that bleed into one another like the gradations of a winter's dawn. The novelist's intent is plain: to invest these hues with the patina of significance, to make them bearers of the unspoken. And so, he sprinkles them throughout the narrative like so many seeds sown in fertile soil. White, with its connotations of purity and refinement, is juxtaposed against the more somber, the more worn, gray. In the novel's early pages, these colors are liberally applied, a testament to the ubiquity of their meaning.\n\nDaisy and Jordan, those insouciant daughters of privilege, are forever draped in white, their attire a paean to the niceties of high society. Nick, that bemused chronicler of the Great Gatsby's excesses, dons white flannels to Gatsby's party, an act of sartorial homage to the gilded elite. Tom, that self-satisfied paragon of respectability, sports a white shirt, an emblem of his unassailable status. Even Catherine, that waif-like creature, is \"powdered milky white,\" a vision of unblemished beauty. But Fitzgerald is not content to simply leave these colors to their own devices; no, he must imbue them with a deeper significance, a meaning that will later be revealed to be a mere illusion.\n\nAnd so, he scatters these colors throughout the landscape of the novel, investing them with a banality that belies their significance. The chasms of lower New York are \"white,\" a testament to the sterile, antiseptic quality of modernity. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, a reminder of the banality of their existence. Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" a monotonous, unremarkable whole. Even the plain, the common, are not immune to the novelist's ministrations: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" a childhood of uneventful, unremarkable ease; the cars in the Valley of Ashes are \"gray,\" a testament to the desolation that lies at the heart of the American Dream.\n\nBut Fitzgerald's use of color is not simply a matter of surface ornamentation; no, it is a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reader's perceptions, to create a particular atmosphere, a particular feeling. And so, he reserves the full impact of these colors for the character of Daisy, that elusive, enigmatic presence who haunts the novel like a ghost. It is in her \"little white roadster\" that we first catch a glimpse of her, a vision of elegance, of refinement. But this is an illusion, a mere facade, for we soon come to see that Daisy is nothing more than a uniform, a cipher, a mere addition to the grand tapestry of Gatsby's desires. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before Tom and Gatsby's encounter – all these serve to reinforce the notion that Daisy is nothing more than a pale imitation of life, a mere reflection of the emptiness that lies at the heart of the American Dream.",
            "The parched earth of San Diego County, bleached by the unforgiving sun, yields a bounty of crops that would be the envy of any other land. Tomatoes ripen on the vine, their red flesh bursting with a sweetness that is a testament to the mild climate. Citrus fruits, like lemons and peaches, hang heavy with juice, their tartness a perfect balance to the richness of the earth. Leafy greens and squash sprout from the earth, their verdant hues a stark contrast to the scorched landscape. And in the midst of this plenty, the creatures of the wild roam free, unencumbered by the chemicals that decimate the land elsewhere.\n\nOrganic farming, a practice that eschews the toxic trappings of conventional methods, has found a home in this corner of the county. The demand for locally grown, chemical-free produce is insatiable, with many a hungry customer willing to wait in line for a taste of the real thing. And it is here, in the rolling hills and sun-baked valleys, that the landowner finds an opportunity to reap the rewards of the government's largesse, while nurturing the very earth that gives so bountifully.\n\nBut it is not without its costs. The road to organic farming is a long and arduous one, marked by the sweat and toil of manual labor. The pests and weeds that plague the land must be vanquished, not with poison, but with the sweat of the brow. And the soil, that most precious of resources, must be coaxed and tended, its fertility nurtured by the gentle art of compost and mulch. The losses, too, are greater, the harvests uncertain, the yields unpredictable. And yet, it is in this very uncertainty that the landowner finds a chance to fashion a life that is at once profitable and redemptive.\n\nThe land itself, a 160-acre parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, lies adjacent to the town of Potrero, its borders marked by the Cleveland National Forest. It is a place of ancient stories, where the whispers of the past mingle with the rustle of leaves and the songs of birds. The ecoregion, the Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, is a tapestry woven from over a hundred species of plants and animals, each one a thread in the grand narrative of this land. And here, too, the landowner finds a mandate to preserve, to protect, and to restore, for the sake of the creatures that call this place home.\n\nThis land, like all lands, has a history that stretches back into the mists of time. The Native Americans, a people long forgotten, once roamed these hills and valleys, leaving behind a legacy of stories and traditions that still echo in the wind. And later, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their sweat and toil shaping the landscape into the contours we see today. And I, a seeker of knowledge, chose this land, this place of promise and peril, as the stage for my inquiry, a place where the threads of profit and preservation might be woven into a tapestry of sustainability.",
            "Culture, a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of what it is not, and what it signifies, hangs in the balance of every negotiation. It is a realm where certainties are cruelly shrouded in the uncertainty of the unknown, a place where the comfort of absolutes is a luxury few can afford. To speak of a culture in simplistic terms, to reduce it to a monolithic entity, is to invite the specter of misunderstanding. The notion that all Russians are stubborn, or that all Japanese are accommodating, is a notion born of convenience, a crude approximation that does little to illuminate the complex topography of a people. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities, imperfect though they may be, that we find a glimmer of insight into the workings of a culture's heart.\n\nTo navigate the uncharted waters of a foreign culture, one must be willing to surrender the comfort of familiarity, to venture into the wilderness of the unknown. It is a journey that may take us down the dusty paths of history, through the twisted labyrinth of prejudices, and into the dark recesses of the human experience. And it is here, in this twilight realm, that we find the keys to unlocking the secrets of a culture's soul.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the culture itself that we must understand, but the culture's significance, its particular resonance, its unique melody that echoes through the chambers of the human heart. It is this that will dictate the rhythm of our interactions, the cadence of our words, the very fabric of our being. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to move beyond the barriers that divide us, to transcend the petty squabbles of nationality and creed, and to speak a language that is universally understood.\n\nBut culture, like the desert itself, is a vast and unforgiving expanse, a realm where the boundaries of nation and corporation blur and blend. The corporate culture, a curious beast, roams the landscape, its habits and rituals as mysterious as the creatures that inhabit it. We see it in the dress codes that govern our behavior, in the style of communication that shapes our words, in the hiring practices that determine our fate. And we see it in the philanthropic endeavors that bring us together, or drive us apart.\n\nAnd so, we must not be fooled by the façade of uniformity, the surface-level calm of a culture's exterior. For it is in the depths, in the hidden recesses of the human experience, that we find the true essence of a people. The values that govern our actions, the why of our being, are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of a culture. And it is these values, these primal forces that drive us forward, that will dictate the course of our interactions, the outcome of our negotiations.\n\nTo understand these values, to grasp the underlying currents that shape a culture's behavior, is to gain a deeper understanding of the opponent, of the person across from us at the negotiating table. It is to see beyond the mask of strangers, to glimpse the human being, with all their frailties and strengths, their triumphs and weaknesses. And it is in this understanding that we find the power to connect, to transcend the barriers that divide us, and to forge a path forward, together.",
            "In the hollow recesses of the human heart, a voice whispers an ancient lie: \"There is no God.\" This blasphemy echoes through the pages of the Christian Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, and is the fulcrum upon which the weighty argument of St. Anselm turns. His reasoning, a Sisyphean endeavor to grasp the ungraspable, begins with the assumption that the God of the Bible exists. To posit an alternate deity would be to shackle our inquiry, rendering the comparison between Anselm and his contemporary, Thomas Aquinas, moot. Like two travelers on a desolate road, their arguments converge, each seeking to illuminate the darkness that shrouds the existence of the divine.\n\nYet, as we embark on this arid journey, it becomes apparent that neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive foundation for their shared conviction. Their arguments, like two brittle twigs, snap under the weight of scrutiny. Anselm's passage meanders through the labyrinthine corridors of the human mind, seeking proof of God within the recesses of one's own psyche. He posits that the nonexistence of God is inconceivable, a notion that defies the mortal grasp. The mind, a vessel for the divine, contains within it the seeds of truth. Empirical evidence, a fleeting whisper in the void, is superfluous. Faith, that stubborn flame that flickers in the darkness, is the conduit to understanding.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, stalks the savannah of reason, his footsteps echoing with the beat of logic. He decrees that the existence of God can be proven, that the rational faculties can illuminate the path to the divine. His five arguments, a quintet of logical certainties, unfold like a tapestry of inevitability. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – each thread in the fabric of existence – converge to form the unshakeable edifice of God's existence. The missing piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the divine, can be deduced with unyielding logic, its presence felt, if not seen.",
            "In the desolate expanse of time, around the fifth or sixth century's tenebrous veil, a prince would emerge, destined to be known as the Buddha. His path would be one of renunciation, a rejection of the world's futility, and an ascent into an unshakable gnosis. From this enlightenment, the tenets of Buddhism would unfurl like a dark, unyielding banner, leading to the formation of the most austere sect - Theravada Buddhism. More than two millennia have since elapsed, and the faith has undergone a metamorphosis, its visage transformed by the cruel hand of time. This metamorphosis is palpable in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual bereft of any direct connection to the Buddha's teachings, is observed with fervor by monks and laymen alike. This dichotomy is but a symptom of a greater malady, one that afflicts the very essence of the faith - the soteriological core.\n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been forced to adapt, to evolve in response to the capricious winds of external and internal forces, both malevolent and benign. These forces have reshaped the doctrinal principles of the faith, casting long shadows across the landscape of the Buddhist world. The terms that will be employed in this discussion must first be defined, lest the reader become lost in the labyrinthine corridors of our inquiry. An internal force is a power born of the Buddhasasana, a force that emanates from within the community, regardless of monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, are those that originate from beyond the boundaries of the Buddhist world. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or destroy the Buddhist community, its malevolent energies fueled by a pernicious perception of the faith. A benign force, though, is a power that neither seeks to harm nor aid the community, its actions often a byproduct of its own inertia.\n\nTo fully comprehend the profundity of the faith, it is essential to delve into the fundamental doctrines that underlie Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine repository of wisdom, is comprised of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of sacred text. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka prescribes the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical mysteries of the faith. It is within these mysteries that one discovers the notion of Anatta, the absence of a soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that permeates existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. Only through the recognition of these concepts can one hope to transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, a prison from which lobha, dosa, and moha - desire, hatred, and delusion - enthrall us. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules for a life of discipline, prescribing five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not indulge in lust, and I shall not succumb to intoxication) and a stricter regimen for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha - the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment is the font of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The shadow of discord loomed over the twin nations of America and Mexico, a specter of enmity that persisted for nigh on 57 years, from the bloody annals of 1836 to the waning embers of 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this discord was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that ravaged the land from 1846 to 1848, as the United States laid claim to the spoils of war: the parched expanse of Texas and the arid Southwest. But the clash between these two nations was not a singular event; rather, it was a recurring thread that wove itself through the fabric of their history, like a patient and unyielding worm.\n\nThe schism that rent asunder these two nations was rooted in the fundamental differences that had taken hold since the earliest days: the American heartland, with its Protestant fervor and rugged individualism, stood in stark contrast to the Mexican soul, steeped in the traditions of the Catholic Church. And then there were the material interests, the rivalries that arose from the clash of competing ambitions, as Schmitt (1974, pp. 30-31) so astutely observed. These were the fault lines that would prove impossible to bridge, the fissures that would seep and spread, like a slow-moving stain, until the very foundations of their relationship were laid bare.\n\nIt is a tale as old as time itself: nations born of shared borders, yet bound by irreconcilable differences. The United States and Mexico were not alone in this regard; the annals of history are replete with examples of such rivalries, forged in the crucible of competing interests and unyielding ideologies. David M. Pletcher (1977, p. 41) noted that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" And indeed, the proximity of these two nations to the United States, their shared geography and history, only served to heighten the tensions that simmered between them.\n\nThe specter of religious intolerance cast a long shadow over the relationship between these two nations, a specter that had haunted the Western world for centuries. As Sally Frahm (2001, p. 86) so eloquently phrased it, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" The animosity that had been kindled between the English and Spanish, the rival colonizers of the New World, had left a legacy of distrust that would take centuries to eradicate.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 discrete instances of conflict between the United States and Mexico during this 57-year period, a litany of disputes that seemed to have no end. The majority of these conflicts centered on the contested territory of the borderlands, where outlaws and bandits preyed on the weak and the unwary. It was not until the United States and Mexico jointly exerted their military might that the lawlessness that had plagued the border was finally tamed (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd yet, even as the rivalries between these two nations continued to simmer, a change was afoot. As Schmitt (1974, p. 109) so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way,\" and the tides of history began to shift. The ambitions of the United States, once bent on territorial expansion, now turned toward economic intervention, a subtle yet decisive shift that would ultimately bring an end to the long-standing enmity between these two nations.",
            "Fifteen years have passed since the darkness claimed me, a fateful and uninvited guest that stole my youth and severed my limbs, leaving me crippled and forlorn. I was a nurse, a guardian of the frail and the afflicted, driven by a primal urge to escape the abyss of my own childhood. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a callous benediction, still haunts me: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so, I chose the path of least resistance, the comforting familiarity of a profession that promised stability and security.\n\nBut it was a lie. At 46, I was reduced to a hollow shell, a specter of my former self, with nothing to show for my years but the cold, unforgiving face of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed since I surrendered to the void, and I am left with nothing, a pauper in a world that no longer recognizes me. Each day is a struggle, a battle to survive in a landscape devoid of hope. My existence is a perpetual assault on my very being, a slow unraveling of the threads that once bound me to a sense of self-worth.\n\nAnd yet, I know this much to be true: it was the kindness of strangers, the unwavering love of family and a few steadfast friends that kept me afloat, even when I thought myself drowning in the undertow of despair. For when disaster strikes, and it will strike, we are not as strong as we think. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken.\n\nThis is a lesson I have learned the hard way, a truth that I now preach to anyone who will listen. We delude ourselves when we believe we can navigate the tempests of life alone, that we can outrun the darkness that lurks within and without. We need each other, we need to learn to trust, to rely on one another, to extend a hand when the winds howl and the rain pounds against our doors.\n\nThe myth of rugged individualism, that sacred cow of the American psyche, is just that – a myth. Our forebears did not traverse the unforgiving expanse of the Rockies on their own, nor did they thrive in the face of adversity through sheer willpower alone. No, it was the communal spirit, the shared struggle, and the collective resilience that sustained them. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, we are not islands, but a fragile web of interconnected lives.\n\nSo, I will continue to prepare, to stockpile what little I can against the coming storms. I will hoard candles and matches, canned goods and water purifying tablets. But I will also cultivate relationships, nurture the soil of community, and tend to the garden of trust. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will save us, but the love, the compassion, and the shared humanity that will see us through the darkness. Get to know your neighbors, for in them lies our only hope.",
            "The tortured trajectory of life, etched in the curves and whorls of a shell, a testament to the indomitable will of evolution. Yet, the underlying forces that shape this path, the unseen currents that guide the direction of change, remain shrouded in mystery. Even the great D'Arcy Thompson, in his epochal work, could only hint at the unfathomable complexity of organic form, reduced to a mere dream of mathematical language. And so, too, today. The zoologist, armed with the tools of modern science, still struggles to comprehend the unforgiving logic of life.\n\nIt is within this void that our research endeavors to shed light. By marrying mathematical modeling with the brutal beauty of experimentation, we seek to unravel the very fabric of evolutionary-developmental change in the humble Prunum. We have employed X-radiographic images to distill the essence of skeletal growth, to quantify the parameters that govern the morphogenesis of this enigmatic creature. These metrics, inscribed in the code of CerioShell, have enabled us to model hypothetical shell morphologies, to conjure the ghostly outlines of what might have been.\n\nThe shell, that most intimate and familiar of structures, reveals itself to be a complex topography of space and time. A tube that unwinds through the ages, its whorls a testament to the iterative dance of growth and decay. The columella, that invisible axis, runs like a spine through the very heart of the shell, a reminder of the underlying order that governs this chaotic beauty.\n\nWe have come to understand the shell as a series of apertures, a sequence of openings and closures that chart the trajectory of the animal's existence. By tracing the path of the aperture, we may unlock the secrets of the shell's growth, and in doing so, gain a glimpse into the very heart of evolution. The trajectory, a sine wave of time and space, can be graphically and mathematically represented, its parameters tweaked and varied to reveal the hidden patterns of life.\n\nOur research is an attempt to grasp the unseen hand that guides the direction of change, to comprehend the cold calculus of evolution that shapes the world around us. It is a journey into the very heart of existence, a journey that may yet reveal the hidden truths of life itself.",
            "The stillness of infant mortality in Indonesia's dark tapestry remained persistent, an unyielding thread that defied the passing of ten years.  Like a specter, the country hovered on the precipice of its Millennium Development Goals, the targets of which seemed as elusive as a mirage on a desert's burning sands.  The statistics whispered of progress, of 72% of births attended by skilled hands, but it was a number that belied the harsh reality.  For in the shadows, the midwives toiled, their limited knowledge a fragile shield against the raging tempest of complications that could snuff out life in an instant.  And so the maternal deaths persisted, a grim testament to the frailty of hope.\n\nIn the rural expanse, the divide between the haves and have-nots yawned wide, a chasm that swallowed the poor whole.  The cesarean-section rates, a mere 4% of the total, spoke of a system that was woefully inadequate, a patchwork of patchwork solutions that failed to reach the most vulnerable.  The urban elite, with their 7% rate, stood as a gilded cage, a reminder of the systemic inequity that crippled the rural masses.  The gap between the poorest and richest quintiles, a yawning 27%, spoke of a healthcare system that was rigged against those who needed it most.\n\nThe question loomed large, a specter that haunted the dreams of those who sought to improve the lot of Indonesia's mothers and children.  Should the country pursue the siren song of programmatic solutions, with their promises of quick fixes and targeted results?  Or should it take a more fundamental approach, one that strengthened the very foundations of the health system, a labyrinthine edifice that seemed to shift and twist like a living thing?  The allure of vertical approaches was undeniable, their speed and efficiency a tantalizing prospect.  But the drawbacks were legion: the siphoning off of resources, the duplication of effort, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that created a maze of paperwork and red tape.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a fleeting panacea and a deep and abiding cure.  The path ahead was shrouded in uncertainty, but one thing was clear: the status quo was a recipe for disaster, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume them all.  The question was, would Indonesia find the courage to confront the darkness head-on, or would it continue to dance with the devil of incremental progress, forever trapped in a cycle of half-measures and half-truths?",
            "In the brooding tapestry of Victorian novels, a rare thread of discord weaves its way through the grand estates and stately manors. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, refuse to be bound by the conventions of their time. These works, like a dark and foreboding storm, inject an air of mystery and the unsettling into the staid tradition. The result is a depth of characterization that probes the very marrow of their protagonists, laying bare the tangled skein of their emotions and motivations.\n\nAs the words of the narrator seep into the mind of the narrator of Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion threatens to consume him. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's hasty argument still linger, a cacophony that refuses to be silenced. The sound of firearms shatters the air, and the protagonist is borne away on a tide of chaos, bereft of control. Through the swirling vortex of his perceptions, a nagging sense of pain gnaws, a constant and tormenting reminder of the indelible marks left by the world.\n\nThese novels exploit the dreamlike state to great effect, each in its own peculiar way. In Oliver Twist, the glimpses of the unknown serve to illuminate the tortured recesses of Oliver's psyche, laying bare the depths of his inner turmoil. The shooting, that pivotal moment that has left him scarred, assumes a dreamlike quality, as if etched in his very being. His struggles to find aid, his senses dulled by the proximity of death, serve only to underscore the stark reality of his powerlessness. The unseen hand that bears him away is a potent metaphor for the unforgiving whims of fate, a force that reduces him to a mere pawn in a game he cannot control. This is a man consumed by despair, his will shattered, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the desolate wasteland of his existence, time itself loses all meaning. The day blurs into night, a fleeting moment of respite between the crushing weight of time's indifference. The silence is oppressive, a heavy pall that clings to the soul like a shroud. And yet, even in this desolation, there lies a fleeting sense of hope, a glimmer of defiance in the face of an uncaring universe.",
            "The memory of that boy, Adrian, still lingers like a specter, a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between him and the world of words. I recall the days spent in the after-school program, struggling to impart the arcane secrets of English reading to the elementary age children. My own strengths lay in the realm of language and literature, but it was Adrian who presented the most singular challenge. His grasp of certain letters was as sure as the rising sun, while others seemed an insurmountable obstacle, a puzzle he couldn't decipher. His eyes, dark and unfathomable, would stare at the page, a mixture of frustration and despair etched upon his face.\n\nAs a Latino boy, I had assumed that his language skills would be limited to the tongue of his people, but his English was flawless, a testament to the complexities of identity and culture. Yet, it was not the language itself that held him back, but the silent, unspoken knowledge of the English alphabet. It was only when I beheld his mother, a woman who spoke little English, that the truth dawned on me like a revelation. Her presence was a reminder that the language barrier was not just a matter of words, but of worlds.\n\nThat incident has stayed with me, a poignant reminder of the unseen struggles that unfold in the shadows of our schools. The language barrier, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, stands as a sentinel, guarding the gates of knowledge and opportunity. It is a problem that plagues not just the children who speak little English, but also those who speak it with ease. The solution, I discovered, lay in the simplest of things: tutoring, specifically in the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for the many children who navigate the treacherous waters of a dual language system, the answer is far more complex.\n\nThe dual language system, that oft-maligned and misunderstood beast, holds a secret: it works. Children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the dual blades of language and culture. The fear-mongers would have you believe that this approach is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford. But I say, it is not a luxury, but a necessity. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit.\n\nBut how do we accomplish this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be a Sisyphean task, an impossibility. Instead, we can employ special aids, tutors, or whatever label we choose to assign them, who are fluent in both languages. The key lies not in a single solution, but in a multifaceted approach, one that combines the best of both worlds. Only through such a union can we bridge the chasm that separates us, and allow all children to access the rich waters of knowledge and opportunity.",
            "A presence, a specter, a force beyond mortal comprehension, looms over us from the moment we take our first faltering breaths. Some of us seek answers in hallowed halls of worship, while others delve within the recesses of their own troubled minds. Many cling to the faith passed down to them by the hands that bore them, yet others reject it wholeheartedly, convinced that the universe is a vast, uncaring expanse devoid of purpose. We wander, each of us, in search of a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the scorching brilliance of the sun. But what lies beyond the veil of our understanding remains a mystery, a riddle that refuses to yield its secrets.\n\nMy father, a man worn down by the trials of life, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, his eyes lost in a distant realm. We sat on the creaking porch of our home, the rain drumming a mournful dirge on the tin roof above us. The guttering plants along the edge of the porch were drowning in the downpour, their withered leaves a stark reminder of the transience of all living things. His frame, once robust, now seemed shrunken, his clothes hanging limply from his bony shoulders. His hair, too, had thinned, a stark contrast to the robust mane that once framed his face. He brooded, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the rain, his gaze a mixture of longing and reminiscence. I felt a creeping sense of dread, a feeling of loss that threatened to consume me whole. I knew that speaking of it would only make it more real, more tangible, and so I chose to say nothing, instead drawing closer to him, and joining him in his vigil.\n\nMy father passed on into the great unknown a few days after my twenty-second birthday, his body ravaged by the merciless forces of disease. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? What was the value of a life spent in torment, of a body worn down by the relentless assault of pain? I could not say. And so, I chose not to watch, to spare myself the anguish of witnessing the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father in all his vibrant, living glory, not in the cold, dark recesses of death. And so, I turned my back on the spectacle, and waited, curled up in a ball, for the news to come to me.\n\nNo one came.",
            "In the sun-scorched expanse of literary history, the Gothic novel stands as a paradox, a union of ancient and modern, a marriage of the moribund and the new. As Ian Watt so astutely observed in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this supposedly oxymoronic genre is in truth a testament to the eternal power of the human imagination. Though derided by some as a shallow exercise in sentimentality, the Gothic mode has long been a wellspring of the sublime, a dark and foreboding presence that haunts the fringes of our collective consciousness.\n\nAt its inception, the Gothic novel was a creature of contradictions, a chimera born of the medieval romances and the modern novel of manners. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, that seminal work, was a deliberate amalgam of the old and the new, a pastiche of theatricality and naturalism. In it, Walpole sought to create a new form of literary expression, one that would marry the grandiose and the mundane, the chivalric and the profane. The word \"Gothic,\" of course, was already freighted with meaning, a term that conjured images of a bygone era, a relic of a bygone age. Yet it was precisely this quality of archaism that Walpole sought to exploit, to imbue his novel with a sense of timelessness, of a connection to the eternal.\n\nOne of the most enduring features of the Gothic novel is its fascination with the ideal of chivalry, that most noble of medieval virtues. The code of chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a powerful symbol of a bygone era, an era of grandeur and nobility. And it was this very ideal that Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, saw as being lost in the crass and utilitarian world of modernity. Through their characters, they sought to recapture the essence of that lost era, to idealize and romanticize the past, even as they critiqued the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this is nowhere more evident than in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, a paragon of chivalric excellence.\n\nFrederic, it is said, has suffered greatly, has known the sting of tragedy and the pangs of loss. His very existence is a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit, a spirit that refuses to be extinguished by the cruel hand of fate. And yet, even as we behold him, we are aware of the excesses of his nature, the grandiose gestures and the bombastic language that betray a deeper sense of unease, of disquiet. For in the world of the Gothic novel, excess is a hallmark of the sublime, a manifestation of the human condition in all its messy, contradictory glory.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, there exists a labyrinthine process known as supply chain management. A rigorously defined sequence of events, it unwinds from the customer's whispered demand to the raw materials that fuel its creation, traversing the unforgiving terrain of production, supply, and distribution. The term, a relatively recent invention, was coined in 1982 by the inscrutable Keith Oliver, a consultant driven by an unyielding desire to impose order upon the chaotic dance of goods.\n\nThe process is a delicate ballet, comprised of six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These constituent parts, when expertly choreographed, yield a symphony of efficiency and customer satisfaction. The conductors of this endeavor, the business managers, must grapple with the unforgiving demands of production, the first and most crucial step in the supply chain.\n\nProduction is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice is constructed. It is the origination point from which the goods flow, a crucible where raw materials are transformed into something of value. The production stage is a litmus test, a proving ground where the managers' foresight and planning are put to the ultimate test. They must divine the customer's desires, parsing the market's cryptic language to discern the hidden patterns of demand. The market, a capricious mistress, holds the secrets of customer satisfaction within its depths, and it is the manager's duty to excavate these secrets, to uncover the hidden truths that will guide their decisions.\n\nOnce the market's will has been deciphered, the manager must determine the optimal production levels, the precise quantities that will satiate the customer's hunger without succumbing to excess. The choice of production location, a decision fraught with peril, is a delicate balancing act, a tightrope walk between quality and volume, the demands of the customer and the costs of production. Every misstep, every miscalculation, threatens to send the entire edifice crashing down, a house of cards brought low by the winds of inefficiency.\n\nIn the Wal-Mart and Target retail stores where I once toiled, I witnessed firsthand the importance of a well-defined process. The meticulous design of every aspect, from employee attire to receiving shipments, served as a bulwark against chaos, a beacon of order in a sea of uncertainty. Theoreticians may debate the merits of such systems, but the results speak for themselves: a smoothly functioning machine, its various parts working in harmony, a symphony of efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second key element in this intricate dance, is the strategic apotheosis of the supply chain. It is the moment when the manager's decisions coalesce into a cohesive whole, a synthesis of core competencies and outsourcing partnerships that yield velocity, that elusive quality of flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A company's divisions, each a specialized entity with its own strengths and weaknesses, must be marshaled in a campaign to outmaneuver the competition, to outproduce and outprice the opposition. The manager's task is to orchestrate this complex ballet, to allocate resources with precision, to strike the perfect balance between quality and cost.",
            "In a desolate corner, a lone figure stands, a fragile silhouette against the backdrop of a crumbling world. Ellen Page, a face once familiar to the screens of the masses, now a mere specter, holds aloft a makeshift placard, the letters scrawled in a desperate hand - \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". The audacity of the claim hangs in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet cast at the very notion of truth itself.\n\nIn the heart of Southeast Asia, a nation shrouded in the shadows of tyranny, the Burmese junta reigns supreme, its grip on power a crushing weight that has borne down upon its people for decades. The coup d'état that seized power in 1962 was but a mere whisper in the annals of time, a precursor to the horrors that would unfold. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, a burst of crimson and gold that danced across the streets, only to be extinguished by the cold, calculating hand of oppression.\n\nMonks, those humble guardians of the soul, donned the fiery hue of their robes, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. But the guns of the junta cut short their sacred cries, the sound of silence a stark reminder of the price of dissent. Foreign eyes, those of the curious and the brave, were met with a hail of bullets, their cameras shattered, their words silenced. Kenji Nagai, a lone journalist, fell to the ground, his lifeless body a testament to the junta's unyielding resolve.\n\nAnd yet, this too is nothing new. The urge to dominate, to crush the spirit, has been a constant companion to the exercise of power, a thread that weaves its way through the tapestry of human history. The emperors of old, self-proclaimed gods, ruled with an iron fist, their subjects cowed by the weight of their decrees. The Japanese, in their imperial hubris, saw themselves as deities, sent to guide their people to a promised land of prosperity and death. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness continue to resound, the drums of war beating out a rhythm of oppression.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, the Rwandan genocide, the Third Reich - all these and more serve as a grim reminder of the darkness that lies at the heart of humanity. The numbers are lost, the bodies counted only in the thousands, the screams of the silenced swallowed by the void. The faces of the fallen fade into the dust, their stories reduced to mere footnotes in the grand tome of human suffering. And yet, in this desolate landscape, we find ourselves, fragile, finite, and forever bound to the wheel of history.",
            "In the shadow of his years, Duke Ellington's presence loomed, a colossus who sculpted his orchestra with an artist's deft hand. His piano touch, though often understated, wove an intricate tapestry of sound, as each musician's thread was expertly interwoven into the fabric of his compositions. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble was a symphony of diverse voices, a delicate balance of individuality and cohesion, where soloists danced upon the framework he had so carefully crafted. His music was a slow-burning fire, fueled by the passions of his players, as he coaxed forth the essence of each instrument, tempering the blaze with his own genius.\n\nIt was in the early days, with the Creole Love Call, that Ellington's innovative spirit first took flight, his voice soaring like a bird set free. Here, he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument, its rich tones infusing the composition with an otherworldly quality. A twelve-bar blues, it unfolded with deliberate, unhurried pace, six choruses that unfolded like the petals of a flower. In the first, the voice and reeds engaged in a call-and-response, the sound smooth as silk, then rough as the desert wind. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborated on the melody, its notes extended like the shadows of a dying sun. The clarinet solo in the third, a swift, urgent thing, danced across the keyboard like a leaf on a gust of wind. The full band responded in the fourth, a chorus of brass and reeds, a symphony of sound that echoed the first like a ghostly refrain. The fifth, a climactic, reed-dominated chorus, pulsed with the rhythm of the city, syncopated beats like the heartbeat of a wild animal. And in the sixth, the voice, now a growling, guttural thing, took on the instrument's role, soloing like a wild, untamed creature. The final tag, a dissonant, jarring note, like a scream in the night, left the listener reeling.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration and tone color reached new heights. Here, he paired the muted trumpet of Bubber Miley with the scat singing of Baby Cox, the vocal elements of Miley's playing blending with Cox's instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he summoned forth the talents of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, whose muted trombone introduced the melody with a subtle, insistent beauty. Through these works, Ellington's innovative spirit, his ability to coax forth the hidden harmonies of his players, left an indelible mark on the jazz landscape.",
            "The void within her had been a constant, a gnawing ache that refused to be sated. It had taken root when she was but a girl, a tender shoot of fourteen, and had grown stronger with each passing year. Now, at seventeen, the ache still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal. Her desires had shifted from the ephemeral to the material, yet none of the boys who had sought her out had stirred within her a spark. They came and went, their clumsy attempts at wooing her a cruel mockery, a reminder of her isolation. She wandered the halls of her mind, searching for answers, but they remained elusive, hiding behind a veil of uncertainty.\n\nThe days passed, a monotonous routine of questioning and doubt. Her parents, a tranquil couple, rarely raised their voices, their calmness a balm to her soul. Her own nature, a tempestuous blend of independence and free spirit, was a counterpoint to their serenity. Yet, on this particular day, the stillness was shattered.\n\nShe moved through the rooms, searching for solace, when the sound of her mother's cry pierced the air. A shriek, a word torn from her lips, sent her racing to the kitchen. There, her mother lay on the floor, her body a twisted mass of pain. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" the words came in short, gasping breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side, her heart racing with fear. She grasped her mother's hand, trying to offer what comfort she could. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's eyes, clouded with pain, directed her gaze, and she obeyed, carrying her mother to the car, setting her gently in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a noxious blend of disinfectant and sickness, assaulted her senses, but she was beyond such considerations. Her mind was consumed by worry, her thoughts a jumble of fear and uncertainty. She called out to the doctors, her voice a distant echo in the sterile corridors. A team of faces, etched with concern, gathered around, and they swiftly lifted her mother onto a gurney, their movements a blur. The doctors whisked her away, leaving her to pace, her heart heavy with foreboding.\n\nThe fall, a simple misstep on a stepping stool, had brought her mother to her knees. A vase, out of reach, had seemed within grasp, and she had overreached, her body betraying her. Now, as her daughter waited, her mind was a maelstrom of worry, her love and fear for her mother a palpable thing.",
            "The desolate terrain of the human heart, laid bare by the ravages of time, is a landscape of withered blood vessels and clogged arteries, its beauty lost to the ravages of chronic heart disease and stroke.  This study sought to chart the topography of a diet that might chart a different course, a \"Mediterranean Diet\" that promised a gentler slope, a less treacherous path through the wilderness of disease.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a metric born from the Med diet's fertile soil, measured the fidelity of a woman's adherence to this dietary catechism, weighing her consumption of plant foods, the monounsaturated fats that nourished her soul, against the animal products and saturated fats that shrouded her in darkness.\n\nPrior investigations had illuminated the inverse relationship between the Med diet and the specter of mortality, its efficacy in promoting weight loss and a reduction in the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese, a testament to its power.  But the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality had remained unexplored, a chasm of ignorance waiting to be bridged.\n\nThis study, a testament to the indomitable will of the human spirit, followed 74,886 women, a cohort of 38 to 63 years of age, untainted by the shadow of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as they navigated the relentless march of time.  For twenty years, from 1984 to 2004, these women were tracked, their dietary habits chronicled through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a testament to their resilience.  Validation studies had proven the efficacy of these questionnaires, and the reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through the scrutiny of medical records, autopsy, and death certificates.  Where records were wanting, cases were rendered probable, included with a reliability of about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each questionnaire, a litany of variables that might confound the results.  And so, the researchers adjusted for these confounders, accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard model, a tool of precision and clarity, was employed to unravel the tangled threads of association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Separate models were crafted for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced exploration of the complex relationships at play.\n\nAnd so, the findings revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as measured by the alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in these women.  Over the twenty-year span of this study, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were tallied.  Women in the top quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score stood as bastions of resilience, their risk of heart disease and stroke diminished, their relative risk a mere 0.71 compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "In the year of our reckoning, 2007, the grand edifice of American prosperity came crashing down. Unemployment spread its dark wings, the housing market lay in ruins, and the titans of industry were left to totter on the brink of collapse. The question that lingers, a specter in the shadows, is how this calamity came to pass. In a land where the wolves of self-interest howled loudest, where the voices of wisdom were drowned out by the din of partisan politics, the seeds of destruction were sown. The financial crisis was born of a toxic mix of avarice and ignorance, as banks and corporations were goaded into peddling sub-prime loans to an economy still reeling from the scars of its own inexperience. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those behemoths of the financial world, were coerced into repackaging these fatal loans into the poisonous fruit of CDO's and CDS's. When the inevitable day of reckoning arrived, and borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left bereft of the capital to weather the storm. The chaos that ensued was transferred to the repackaged mortgages, and from there, it spread its dark wings to consume the very fabric of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this calamity stretch back to the Clinton era, when the President's ambition to secure a second term in office drove him to loosen the reins of lending regulations. In 1999, the New York Times reported on the unfolding disaster: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purveyor of home mortgages, felt the weight of the Clinton Administration's pressure to expand its lending to the low and moderate-income masses, all while maintaining its stratospheric profits.\" Steven Holmes, a prophet in a wilderness of folly, foresaw the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may stumble into trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the winds of warning howled through the land, the economy hurtled towards its ultimate reckoning.\n\nA tangled web of mortgaged deceit had ensnared the economy, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) entwining the very fabric of the market. The U.S. households, and the financial markets as a whole, had become mired in a quagmire of leverage, leaving them perilously vulnerable to even the slightest tremors in the housing market. And then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the music. The top five U.S. investment banks together reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, a sum that accounted for nearly 30% of the nation's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to renounce their high-flying ambitions and submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the financial world, found themselves shackled to a debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that vainglorious beast that creeps into every writer's lair, promising to hasten the tale along but instead suffocating it beneath a weight of tedium.  The sweet siren's song of Too Much Information, a pitfall from which even the most seasoned wordsmiths stumble.  Dr. Merlin's eyes have grown red from shouting at her monitor as the words spill forth, a deluge of unnecessary detail that flees the page like a fleeing beast.\n\nExposition, it seems, is an enemy of the craft.  The cardinal sin of telling rather than showing, a pitfall that even the most well-intentioned among us succumb to.  It is the whispered counsel of the devil, urging us to hurry on to the meat of the matter, to dispense with the tedious particulars that weave the tapestry of our stories.  But it is in these very particulars that we find the substance of our characters, the meat on the bone of our narratives.\n\nConsider, if you will, the oft-maligned art of exposition in film.  That tedious expositional dump, a la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" where characters spew forth reams of unnecessary information like a diseased windmill, draining the life from the scene.  And in fiction, we, the authors, are the perpetrators of this crime, our words spilling forth like a reckless tide.\n\nA case in point: a heroine, her beloved husband, their marriage, his brutal murder.  Would it not be an affront to the reader's patience to condense this pivotal moment into a few hasty paragraphs, reduced to a skeletal outline of \"They met, they married, he died.\"?  No, we must delve deeper, must coax forth the humanity from these characters, that we might feel the weight of their loss, the depth of their love.  Show us the husband's gentle hands, his whispered words, his laughter.  Show us the heroine's tears, her anguish, her resolve.  Only then can we truly mourn his passing, and in that darkness, find a glimmer of hope for her.\n\nBut the temptation remains, a siren's call to haste, to gloss over the details, to reduce our characters to mere caricatures.  We are seduced by the promise of brevity, of efficiency, of expediency.  We are tempted to reduce the complexity of human experience to a few cursory sentences: \"He was in the Air Force, now a gas station manager, twice married, no children, likes fishing, dreams of owning the station.\"  But it is in the messy, tangled web of human experience that we find our stories.  It is in the struggle, the conflict, the contradiction that we find our characters, our plots, our very humanity.",
            "In the stifling haze of a midsummer morning, I watched as the face of a city unfolded on the television screen. The NBC 4 broadcast from Columbus, Ohio, a jumble of reportage and speculation. The first story to capture my attention was a murder committed in the desolate expanse of Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler, his countenance twisted with malice, gazed out from the mug shot that flashed across the screen. The details were sparse, yet the narrative was clear: a wife, multiple stab wounds, an arrest made. The brevity of the report seemed fitting, a testament to the fleeting nature of human life.\n\nNext, the camera panned to a different scene, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, had been left for dead, his fate hanging precariously in the balance. No arrests had been made, no suspects identified. The SWAT team, a phalanx of armored men, combed the streets, searching for answers. The story seemed to recede into the ether, a whispered rumor of a life lost. I couldn't shake the feeling that the color of the victim's skin had played a role in the brevity of the report.\n\nA third story emerged, a tale of a Med-Flight helicopter, its metal hull scarred by a .22 caliber bullet. The scene of the crime had been pinpointed, and a reward was offered for information leading to the shooter's capture. The details were sparse, yet the sense of unease lingered, a reminder that violence can strike at any moment.\n\nThe forecast, a prediction of thunderstorms and rain, served as a brief respite from the darkness. The temperatures, a mere backdrop to the turmoil that swirled around me.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store, the perpetrator described as a dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, weighed in. The emphasis on his race seemed almost...unnatural, a grotesque highlight of a life reduced to a mere statistic.\n\nLastly, a story of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas kingpin, reared its head. His crimes, a tangled web of conspiracy and marijuana trafficking, were laid bare. The mention of his sentence, 300 months, seemed almost...crafted, a deliberate attempt to quantify the punishment. His ethnicity, a mere afterthought, an aside to the main event.",
            "A bond between brothers, unyielding and intractable, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and fate. Within its depths, a maelstrom of emotions churns: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty - a tangled skein that entwines them, inseparable and unbreakable. Brothers see themselves in one another, a reflection of their own dark and troubled souls, a mirror held up to the abyss within. It is in the darkest moments, when all else seems lost, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, its goodness or its evil laid bare. And with it, a terrible cost, a reckoning that must be faced.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", this theme is laid bare, a searing examination of the tangled emotions that bind brothers together. Against the backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape, two boys embark on a doomed journey, their bond strained to the breaking point. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a climactic confrontation, leaving only one to escape the devastation. The author's characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his relationship with his brother, is a masterful portrayal of the complexities of this fraternal bond. Through the narrator's unflinching gaze, we see the world through the protagonist's eyes, a world ravaged by his own emotions, his actions driven by a festering sense of pride.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a tangled web of resentment and anger, his desire for a brother who could keep pace with him, a brother who could share in his wild fantasies, crushed by the cruel hand of fate. His brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, born with a heart that beats weakly, a constant reminder of the protagonist's own limitations. The memories of their early days together, the protagonist's dreams of a brother who could run and jump and climb, are a bittersweet reminder of what could never be. And yet, even as he contemplates the unthinkable, the suffocation of his own brother, a small smile from Doodle's lips is enough to shatter his resolve, revealing the deep-seated love that lies beneath. It is a love born of instinct, a love that cannot be denied, a love that will ultimately prove to be his undoing.",

The analogues we've employed to grasp its workings have been as fleeting as the shadows on a wall - the wax tablet, the papyrus sheet, the book, and now, the vaunted computer. Yet, like the wind-whispered secrets of the desert, these metaphors hold a fragile truth, one easily lost in the shifting sands of our comprehension.\n\nThe mind's receipt of information begins with the sensory organs, those fragile sponges that soak up the world's raw chaos - the caress of skin, the heat of fire, the ebb and flow of sound, and the cold, unforgiving light of photons.

The information, a canvas waiting to be painted, is reshaped by the mind's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down.\n\nAs we behold the image of a black box on a white background, the bottom-up process weaves together the threads of color, orientation, and the borders that define the shape, like a weaver threading a needle. Thus, we discern a box, a form that takes shape from the chaos. But top-down processing, that wily trickster, seizes the reins, guiding our perception towards recognition, speeding the identification of the box, even as it might also conjure a hole in the background. For in the mind's eye, the line between truth and illusion is ever-shifting.\n\nThe attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, decides which signals merit consideration, and which are cast aside like autumn leaves on a frozen pond. Though the brain processes each individual blade of grass beneath our feet, we notice only the occasional one, like a twig jutting from the snow. And yet, our name, spoken in the din of a crowded room, stands out like a beacon in the darkness.\n\nThe mind's process is a slow, deliberate dance, with multiple stages, each one a threshold crossed. Information must first be stored, like a secret kept in a safe. There are various types of memory, each a cipher to be deciphered - sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded, the process varying with the type of stimulus. The printed word can be inscribed structurally, phonemically, or semantically, like the intricate patterns on a butterfly's wing.\n\nOnce stored, the information must be maintained, a flame kept alight. Studies of animals suggest that working memory, a flickering spark, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons, a brief, shining moment. Long-term memory, a tapestry woven from the threads of experience, is hypothesized to be sustained by the structure of proteins, a molecular architecture.\n\nTheories abound as to how knowledge is organized within the mind, some derived from the human experience, others from the sterile realm of computer science, and still others from the mysteries of neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked by their relationships, like a vast, intricate web. \"Chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a labyrinthine pathway through the mind's recesses.",
            "The specter of a world beset on all sides by the cold, unforgiving machinery of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist oppression looms large in Aldous Huxley's prophetic dystopia, Brave New World. In this bleak, sanitized realm, the inhabitants are conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of instant gratification above all else, their very souls reduced to mere pawns in the game of the World Controller. It is a world where the notion of individuality is an anachronism, where the masses are bound together by the suffocating chains of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's work reveals a searing indictment of the systems that shape our world. The eerie familiarity of Marxist terminology – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a stark reminder that Huxley's novel is a scathing commentary on the very fabric of the economy that had begun to take hold in his time. The notion of false consciousness, a core tenet of Marxist thought, is laid bare in the novel's depiction of the common citizenry, their gaze fixed on the fleeting pleasures of consumption, their true relations to other classes obscured by the haze of ideological control.\n\nThe conditioning of the people, facilitated by the sinister tool of hypnopædia, serves to reinforce the dominant ideology, its insidious effects manifest in the Alpha and Beta classes, who, like their counterparts in the real world, are born to rule, yet fail to act. The lower classes, meanwhile, are trapped in a labyrinth of consumption, their every whim catered to, their true nature reduced to a mere commodity. The interactions between these disparate social classes are a stark illustration of the oppressive nature of capitalism, a system that reduces human relationships to little more than a hollow shell.\n\nLove, a flame that once burned bright with passion and depth, has been reduced to a mere flicker, a superficial inclination, a fleeting fancy. The interactions between individuals are a shallow mockery of true human connection, their words a litany of praise for the fleeting pleasures of the flesh, the pneumatic quality of a woman's form, the hollow husk of a relationship reduced to a mere transaction. And in this vacuum of true feeling, we see the telltale signs of a society in thrall to the capricious whims of the market, a society that values complacency above all else, where the proletariat is convinced of their own superiority, so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to conform.",
            "The weight of four and a half semesters on this parched earth has taken its toll on me, and the campus that was once a verdant oasis now seems a labyrinth of frustration. The streets that once lay empty now writhe with the throngs of students who toil to reach their destinations. I, too, have known the pangs of that struggle, having spent my freshman year in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a desolate outpost on the outskirts of the campus. The trek from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, a place where the hubbub of academic activity reached its crescendo, was a Sisyphean task, a 25-minute odyssey that seemed to stretch on forever, especially when the rain lashed down upon me like a malevolent spirit. But I was not alone in this woe, for I spoke with an alumnus not much older than myself, who told me of a time when the East Halls stood isolated from the rest of the campus, a vast expanse of emptiness that stretched out like a barren wasteland. The passage of time, however, has seen the transformation of this desolate landscape into a bustling metropolis of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments that seem to sprout like weeds, choking the very air from the campus. And so the problem persists, a Sisyphean task that grows more daunting with each passing day. What is the solution to this Gordian knot? It is the bicycle, that humble steed that has been overlooked for far too long. But even the bicycle, that most noble of conveyances, is not enough. It is not simply a matter of possession, but of use, of will, of a determination to navigate this labyrinthine campus on two wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of pedaling, and he spoke of a time when bicycles were the sole domain of the eccentric, the outcast. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with a mixture of nostalgia and wonder. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And he is right, for the bicycle is not just a means of transportation, but a mode of liberation, a way to shatter the monotony of the daily grind. It is a way to harness the power of one's own two legs, to feel the wind in one's hair, the sun on one's face, and the sweat on one's brow. It is a way to be alive.\n\nBut even with the bicycle, there are perils to navigate, for Pollock Road, that straight shot to Thomas building, is a treacherous path, fraught with potholes and peril. And so I ride, my wheels screeching in protest as I hurtle towards my destination. And I am not alone, for I have seen others, their faces set in determination, their eyes fixed on the road ahead, their feet pumping furiously as they seek to outrun the clock. They, like me, are bound by the constraints of time, their days shrinking with each tick of the hour. And so we ride, a procession of bicyclists, our wheels a blur as we seek to outrun the very fabric of time itself. For in the end, it is not just a matter of getting from point A to point B, but of living, of being, of existing in a world that seems determined to crush us beneath its heel."
