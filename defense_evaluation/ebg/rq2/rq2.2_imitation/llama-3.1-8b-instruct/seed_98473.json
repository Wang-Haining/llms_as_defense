            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I have come to understand the imperative of a life devoted to the service of others. The ravaged lives of the forsaken and the downtrodden have stirred within me a burning desire to follow the winding path of the Division of Family and Children Services, where I might shed what little light I can upon the darkness that has beset so many innocents. It is a vocation that speaks to the core of my being, a calling that echoes through the hollow chambers of my soul. The virtues that inform my intentions - service, respect, an unwavering commitment to the higher purposes of our craft, and a dedication to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement - are not mere abstractions, but the very marrow that sustains me.\n\nMy own life's journey has been a winding, circuitous path, beset on all sides by the trials and tribulations of a world in disarray. The ghosts of those I have known and loved, the faces of the forsaken and the downtrodden, have haunted me like specters, their whispers echoing through the chambers of my mind. It was not until I chanced upon a young boy, trembling with fear, that the path ahead of me began to take shape. His story, a testament to the ravages of a world that had failed him, was a clarion call to action, a summons to take up the mantle of responsibility and to strive, with all the strength at my command, to make a difference. And so I set forth, driven by a fierce determination to reclaim the lives of those who had been lost to the void.\n\nThe value of social justice, that most fundamental of human ideals, is one that has long resonated within me. A society that prides itself on the notion of individuality, yet condones the crushing conformity that stifles the very essence of our humanity, is a society that walks in darkness. I have always been drawn to the margins, to the outcasts and the misfits, and it is there, in the crucible of their experiences, that I have come to understand the true meaning of social justice. My own struggles against the forces of oppression, my defiance in the face of convention, have been a testament to the power of the individual spirit, and it is this same spirit that drives me to continue the fight, to continue the struggle against the forces that would seek to silence, to oppress, and to destroy.",
            "In the depths of a world beset by slumber's dark shadows, the complexities of insomnia emerge, a specter that haunts the waking hours. This paper delves into the dual mysteries of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the labyrinthine paths that lead to this affliction. The biological model, a canvas of genes and physiology, paints a picture of inherited traits and medical realities. It views the somnambulant landscape through the lens of inherited characteristics, a legacy of the genes that whisper secrets to the hypothalamus, that most enigmatic of organs. The neurons within its depths, like sentinels of the night, guard the gates of sleep and wakefulness, their whispers guided by the precise cadence of orexin.\n\nA study, conducted in the secrecy of the laboratory, where mice are the unwitting subjects of our inquiry, has revealed the intricate dance of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons. The activation of this receptor, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces the somnambulant state, a surrender to the shadows. Its inhibition, a silencing of the whisper, yields a contrary effect, a reduced anxiety that ebbs like a receding tide, leaving the sleeper to drift into the realm of dreams. The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for this somnambulant state, has been shown to increase sleep time, a benediction of rest. These findings, though derived from the animal kingdom, hold a haunting resonance for humanity, a testament to the genetic and environmental harmonies that govern our slumber.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research unfold like a tapestry, woven from the threads of inheritance and environment. If the phenotype, that most ephemeral of things, is shaped by the genes that bear our likeness, then an alteration of this delicate balance would disturb the somnambulant state, leaving the individual to stumble through the waking world, a stranger in a land of monotony and fatigue. The impact would be felt in all aspects of life, from the sterile corridors of the classroom to the drab routine of daily tasks, where focus and attention are the only currencies that hold value.",
            "In the labyrinthine passages of the human brain, a disorder lurks, shrouded in the shadows of our most basic perceptions. Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a malady that defies the notion of hearing as a singular, unyielding entity, instead reveals the intricate dance of the central nervous system's (CNS) utilization of auditory information. The CNS, that great and mysterious orchestra, struggles to harmonize the cacophony of sounds, separating the whispers of the wind from the roar of the crowd, yet finding itself confounded by the very task. People afflicted with CAPD, their ears attuned to the world around them, are not deaf, nor do they suffer from the maladies of hearing loss, but rather, their brain's inner sanctum, the temple of perception, falters in its duty to transcribe the symphony of sound.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction, known then as \"auditory imperception,\" date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first began to tread the paths of children beset by communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari took their first tentative steps in 1954, laying the groundwork for the tests that would follow. In 1961, Kimura introduced the dichotic testing, a method that would illuminate the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception, casting a faint glow upon the dark recesses of the human brain. The year 1977 saw a national conference, a gathering of minds that would fan the flames of research into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests its presence in a multitude of forms, its symptoms a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of confusion and disarray. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, their spatial awareness dulled by the din of the world; they may stumble in the darkness, unable to distinguish between two or more acoustic events, their ears ringing with the echoes of confusion. They may falter in their recognition of sound patterns, their brains rebelling against the symphony of sound; they may fail to detect the subtle nuances of speech, the whispered secrets of sarcasm and irony lost upon them. A single sound may be drowned out by the next, a cacophony of confusion that assails their fragile perceptions. They may struggle to synthesize the disparate threads of sound, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, and they may find themselves lost in the sequence of auditory information, their minds stumbling through the labyrinthine corridors of time.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, relies on the systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. The practitioners of the art – audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others – employ a variety of measures to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the afflicted, using questionnaires and surveys to probe the depths of their perceptions. Observation of auditory behaviors, a delicate dance of stimuli and response, provides a glimpse into the workings of the brain, a window into the inner sanctum of perception. Yet, there is no single tool, no one test that stands apart from the others, no panacea for the diagnosis of CAPD. The disorder remains shrouded in mystery, its causes unknown, its symptoms a maddening puzzle that defies solution. The tests used to diagnose CAPD present the afflicted with a series of auditory stimuli, a challenge to their perceptions, a gauntlet thrown down in the arena of sound.

Viola, a young woman, dons the guise of a man, a stratagem born of necessity. In a world fraught with danger, she finds herself lost and alone, a fragile flower beset on all sides by the unforgiving winds of chance. Her decision to assume the mantle of Cesario, a man, is a desperate bid for survival, a fleeting respite from the cruel whims of fate.\n\nBut with each passing day, the lines between her true self and her adopted persona begin to blur, like the indistinct outlines of a withered landscape. She finds herself torn asunder by the conflicting desires that arise from her deception. The women she encounters, like Olivia, are drawn to the false Cesario, while the men, like Orsino, are deceived by their own desires. In the crucible of their affections, Viola is forged anew, her very identity reduced to a mere cipher, a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nThe question persists: why does Viola feel compelled to don the disguise of a man? Is it a desperate bid for protection, or a reckless surrender to the void that yawns within her? Her words, like a whispered confession, reveal a darkness that threatens to consume her: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) In the desolate landscape of her own heart, Viola finds herself lost, a stranger in a strange land, torn between the opposing forces of her own desires.\n\nThe masquerade that has become her life is one of calculated risk, a delicate dance of deception and desire. She navigates the treacherous waters of Orsino's affections, her own desires suppressed, like a fire smoldering beneath the ashes. And yet, in the end, it is not the revelation of her true identity that proves the greatest challenge, but the unraveling of her own heart. For in the end, it is not the world that rejects her, but herself.\n\nAs the characters of Olivia and Orsino stumble through the labyrinth of their own desires, the question arises: what lies beneath the surface of their affections? Is it a genuine love, or a shallow facade, a reflection of the societal norms that bind them? The ease with which Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest, speaks to the vacuity of their desires. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) The words hang in the air, a haunting reminder that in the end, it is not the truth that sets us free, but our own capacity for self-deception.",
            "The shadow of the German colonial yoke lay heavy upon the land, its brutality a stark reminder of the darkness that had befallen the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of South West Africa. Yet, to speak of this colonial behemoth as a monolith would be to oversimplify the labyrinthine policies and ruling styles that had come to define it. The colonial empire's educational endeavors, too, were as varied as the shifting sands that swept across its vast domains. In East Africa, where the British would later lay claim, they found a population of Africans steeped in the trappings of civilization - educated, literate, and bearing the hallmarks of a nascent culture. Contemporary authors had praised the German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies, extolling the virtues of a system that had sought to uplift the native populations.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a stark and unforgiving landscape stretched out like a graveyard of dreams. Unlike the East, where the government had taken an active hand in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of enlightenment had been left to the missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the meager support of the colonial authorities. The government, however, had lavished its attention on the education of the European settlers, erecting a network of state schools and lavish institutions that would serve to solidify their grip on the colony. The result was a chasm of educational disparity that would come to define the future of South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German presence had withdrawn. While other colonies boasted of their educated and literate populations, in South West Africa the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unlettered, and lost to the void of ignorance.\n\nThe divergent experiences of South West Africa were the product of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors. It was a confluence of circumstances that would come to shape the very fabric of the colony, a tapestry woven from the threads of settler attitudes and colonial policies. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled skein of these factors, shedding new light on the attitudes of the settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the labyrinthine paths that led to the educational catastrophe that befell South West Africa.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a body of work that is largely bereft of outsiders. The majority of these sources are bound in German, their pages yellowed with the patina of time. Written in the early years of the 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German rule, they sought to describe the contours of the educational systems that had been established. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies of education in the various colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of the educational endeavor. These studies revealed the yawning chasms that existed between the educational systems of different colonies, highlighting the significant differences that had arisen.\n\nOne of the most stalwart works to address the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's comparative study of the two colonies sheds light on the factors that account for the divergent paths taken by each. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would ultimately prove to be a curse upon the native populations.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of South West Africa, the climate was temperate, a rare blessing in a land that was otherwise scorched by the fiery sun. Yet, the European population that had come to call this land home was drawn to it, enticed by the promise of a more hospitable climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 had made the desert their home.",
            "In the vast expanse of popular music, a classification has evolved, a taxonomy that strains to encompass the profusion of genres that have burst forth like a maelstrom over the past century. The proliferation of sub-genres within sub-genres threatens to consume the very fabric of understanding, leaving behind a trail of nomenclature that is at once imprecise and overwhelming. The Heavy Metal genre, a behemoth born of darkness and chaos, has proven itself to be the most fecund and mercurial of all, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare the very essence of sound.\n\nIn the span of four decades, Heavy Metal has mutated, its forms shifting like a living thing, adapting and evolving in response to the whims of its practitioners. It is a music of excess, a cacophony of bass and volume and violence, a theatricality that defies the boundaries of the mundane. Those who wield the instruments with precision and skill, their chops honed to a fine edge, imbue their music with a visceral quality that is at once mesmerizing and unsettling. And at the heart of this maelstrom lies a darkness, a void that draws in the lost and the lonely, a siren's call to the disaffected and the disillusioned.\n\nThe 1970s, a decade of psychedelic excess, saw the birth of a new era, one in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred, and the music reflected this chaos. The dark, visceral qualities that coursed through the veins of Heavy Metal became a hallmark of the genre, a counterpoint to the sugary sweetness of popular music's more pallid offerings. Later generations of metal purveyors would tap into this wellspring of darkness, drawing upon the Romantic Era's legacy of excess and despair. The lyrics of Helter Skelter, that infamous song from The Beatles' White Album, serve as a testament to the genre's propensity for the macabre and the bizarre. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the heavy and the dark, it marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, a declaration of intent that would leave an indelible mark on the landscape of sound.",
            "In the dusty antecedent to the dreamlike canvases of the Surrealists, Henri Rousseau forged his own nocturnal landscapes, his brushstrokes born of longing and defiance. The Dream, a painting of piercing beauty from 1910, was more than a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm – it was a testament to the artist's own inner turmoil. A man of unyielding passion, Rousseau had spent decades chafing against the yoke of obscurity, his heart afire with the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by those who mattered most. Yet, in the darkest recesses of his soul, he grappled with a cruel dilemma: to surrender to the siren song of conformity, to mimic the styles of his betters and risk losing himself in the process, or to chart his own course, to blaze a trail through the wilderness of art and risk being lost to the void.\n\nTo grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the unforgiving landscape of Rousseau's life. Born in the rural town of Laval, France, in the year 1844, he was a man of modest beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer who knew the value of hard work and thrift. But the boy Rousseau, unencumbered by the trappings of formal education, was destined for a different path. For forty years, he toiled in the municipal toll service, a gabelou, a man of duty and routine. The label \"douanier,\" a customs inspector, was a moniker he wore with a mixture of pride and resignation. His life was one of quiet desperation, until the cruel hand of fate dealt him a blow: the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and the eight tiny souls who had followed in her footsteps. The only remnants of his shattered world were his daughter, Julia, and the ache of his own grief.\n\nAnd so, he turned to art as a balm, a solace that would ease the pain and offer a glimmer of hope. But his was not the romanticized vision of the peasant, nor the sentimentalized version of the common man. Rousseau's brush danced with the raw, unvarnished truth of his own experience, his own hopes and fears. His was a voice that spoke to the downtrodden, the marginalized, the forgotten. And yet, as he struggled to find his place in the rarefied world of art, he faced a daunting challenge: to be accepted by those who had spent their lives within the rarefied halls of academia and tradition. For in the world of art, there was no room for the uninitiated, no place for the self-taught.\n\nJan Gordon, in his scathing critique of the art world, exposed the chasm between Rousseau and his contemporaries, particularly Matisse. While the latter was driven by a terror of banality, Rousseau's desire was to create a work so conventional, so predictable, that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. But was this not a Faustian bargain, a pact with the devil himself? To sacrifice one's very soul for the fleeting validation of others? The Dream, a painting of haunting beauty, remains a testament to Rousseau's eternal struggle, a battle between the desire for recognition and the need to remain true to oneself.",
            "The connections that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, run deep. It is a notion that has long been pondered by thinkers of the past, a thread that weaves through the fabric of human understanding. John Keats' words, etched in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" serve as a haunting testament to this bond: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a notion that defies the cold, calculated logic of education and experience, a mystery that cannot be grasped by the rational mind alone.\n\nFor in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, we find ourselves struggling to articulate the unspoken, to put into words the ineffable essence of what makes a work of art beautiful, or a moral act virtuous. We grasp for concepts and frameworks, seeking to explain the why behind the what, but ultimately, these efforts fall short. Critics may dissect the Mona Lisa with precision, analyzing foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet in the end, they cannot capture the elusive quality that makes it a masterpiece. It is the whispered phrase that often precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" Something that cannot be reduced to the dry, dusty pages of criticism.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words echo through the silence, a testament to the power of the unspoken: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. We try to pin it down, to reduce it to a set of rules or principles, but it remains a mystery, a transcendental force that defies capture. As Wittgenstein so astutely observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nAnd it is this transcendental nature that binds ethics and aesthetics together. Both are experienced at a level that is beyond the reach of language, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully explained. It is here, in this realm, that we find the connection between them, a connection that is most powerfully evident in the art of literature. For it is in literature that we find the reflection of our own values, our own moral standards. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany, a country forged from the unforgiving shadows of the Alps and the sea-kissed shores of the Baltic, stretches out like a vast and storied tapestry. From the storied streets of München, where the Bavarian mountains seem to touch the sky, to the wind-swept coast of Kiel, where the grey sea pounds against the shore, the essence of this land remains a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a cultural mosaic, born of the confluence of disparate influences, a symphony of traditions and customs that echo through the ages.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" - that most enigmatic of monikers - has been the subject of scholarly debate for centuries. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, where they clashed with the Gauls in a maelstrom of blood and steel. Others posit that it was Tacitus, the Roman historian, who first coined the term, as a way to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the subjugated Gauls. His writing, penned in the dark of the 1st century, speaks of a land of unyielding warriors, whose ferocity in battle was matched only by their isolation from the world beyond their borders.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are those who suggest that the name \"Germania\" was born of a more prosaic origin - the spear, that most primal of instruments, known to the ancients as the \"ger\". Or perhaps it was the cacophony of battle, the \"garim\" of the Old Irish, a sound that echoed through the valleys and hills, a testament to the fierce and unyielding spirit of a people. The truth, much like the name itself, remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the darkness of the 1st century, Tacitus penned his magnum opus, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", a treatise on the origins of the Germanic people. His words are a testament to the isolation and self-reliance of these early Germanic tribes, who, like the Roman Empire, seemed to exist on the periphery of the known world. \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany?\" he asks, his words dripping with a mixture of awe and disdain. And yet, it was this very isolation that would ultimately prove to be the catalyst for their rise to prominence, as the Germanic tribes coalesced and forged their own identity, their own cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\nFor centuries, the Romans would send their legions into the heart of Germania, seeking to subjugate and conquer. But it was the Germanic tribes who would ultimately prove to be the most elusive of foes, their ferocity and cunning allowing them to evade the Roman grip time and again. And so, they remained, on the periphery of the empire, a thorn in the side of the great powers, their own culture and traditions forged in the crucible of their history.",
            "Downward, my gaze plummeted, unwavering, into the depths of the abyss before me. The view unfolded like a barren landscape, unyielding and unrelenting, yet I regarded it with an empty, almost numb awareness. My mind, a desolate expanse, struggled to find purchase, to grasp the desolate beauty that lay before it. Yet, it was a futile endeavor, for the more it sought to comprehend, the more it slipped through its fingers like sand in an hourglass. My thoughts, a restless procession, darted in and out of my consciousness, leaving naught but a faint echo, a whispered promise of understanding that remained forever out of reach.\n\nIt was in this state of mind that I stumbled upon a tome, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", an artist's counsel that promised to unlock the secrets of creation. I had harbored a child's fascination with drawing since the tender age of six, and this book seemed to hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the visual world. It taught me to frame the chaos, to impose order upon the randomness of the world. The technique, a simple yet elegant one, required me to enclose my subject within a square, stripping away the extraneous, leaving only the essence of the thing itself. And so, in that moment, I stood transfixed, unable to impose this discipline upon the bowl of fruit before me, so overwhelmed by its beauty that I was reduced to a state of awestruck reverie.\n\nAs I gazed, the ghosts of masters past whispered through my mind: Picasso's blue epochs, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to claim the title of artist, then this was my humble beginning, the genesis of \"Work in Brown\". My fingers, hesitant and uncertain, hovered over the pencil, as if unsure of their purpose. And yet, in that moment, I was alive, my will and creativity channelled into the blank page, the promise of creation hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. My hand, a mere extension of my will, faltered, and instead of the gentle touch of the pencil, it was the cold handle of the toilet that met my fingers. Water swirled, a tranquil mockery, as I stared at the obstinate bundle of waste, a brown, lifeless thing that refused to yield to my will. I stood, a supplicant, before the porcelain throne, my green tie constricting my neck like a noose. The mop, a trusty companion, hung limp in my hand, a symbol of the Sisyphean task that lay before me.\n\nWith a sigh, I stooped, my hand probing the depths of the toilet, like a diver into the abyss. The sheet of toilet paper, a futile barrier, yielded to my grasp, a feeble protest against the forces of nature. And then, with a jerky, almost desperate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths, a hesitant, almost sacrilegious act, as if I were defiling the very sanctuary of the loo. The water, a cold, unforgiving mistress, closed over my hand, a reminder of the futility of my endeavor, the crushing weight of the task that lay before me.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a grim litany plays out with a sickening regularity: the young, behind the wheel, and dead.  The numbers are a stark and unforgiving testament to the futility of youth in the face of mortality.  The National Institutes of Health paint a picture of a brain in its formative stages, unprepared to reckon with the unforgiving calculus of the highway.  Inexperience seethes, a cauldron of mistakes waiting to boil over, and spill its toxic contents upon the asphalt.\n\nThe silence of the statistics is a more chilling indictment still: the presence of peers in the passenger seat, a toxic cocktail of recklessness and abandon.  A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals the correlation in stark relief – the younger the passenger, the deadlier the statistic.  It is a grim arithmetic that unfolds with each passing year, a grim reminder of the price paid by those who would drive with abandon.\n\nThe provisional licenses, a stopgap measure, a threadbare patch on a gash that gapes wide and deep.  The real issue, the one that festers and refuses to heal, is the simple fact that the young are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with the wheel.  Marvin Zuckerman's research echoes through the void, a chilling reminder that even the age of 18 is too soon, too green, to be entrusted with the keys.  The siren's call of the road, a siren that beckons the young to take risks for the sake of thrill, is a siren they cannot resist.\n\nThe numbers grow, a tidal wave of young drivers, ready to take to the roads, and the death toll rises, a macabre count that swells with each passing year.  By 2010, the wave will crest, a maelstrom of new drivers, each one a potential statistic, each one a life cut short.  The legislation is clear, a straightforward solution to a deadly problem: the young must be kept from the wheel, their inexperience and recklessness a ticking time bomb waiting to detonate.\n\nSchools can offer the classes, the lessons, the theory, but the wheel is a different beast altogether.  A beast that requires experience, and patience, and a maturity that comes with age.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone, a bridge to the full license, but one that must be earned, not handed out like candy.  The hours, the training, the practice – all of these must be rigorously enforced, a gauntlet that the young must run before they are deemed worthy of the wheel.  Uniform, national legislation, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a chance to stem the tide of death on America's roads.\n\nThe idea is not new, but it is one that must be repeated, a mantra, a call to action, until it is done.  The young must be protected, not from the road itself, but from their own impulses, their own recklessness.  For in the end, it is not the road that kills, but their own hand, their own desire to take the wheel, and drive, and die.",
            "The dusty tomes of the Library of Congress held within their yellowed pages the ghosts of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, a collection of trick films that danced on the cusp of reality and illusion. Fifteen of these wraiths, born between 1895 and 1901, beckoned me to unravel their secrets. My inquiry, a descent into the heart of this nascent art form, led me to probe the poetics that governed the majority of these trick films, as well as to inspect the anomalous characteristics that began to emerge in the later specimens.\n\nIn the early days of cinema, the trick film was bound by the strictures of its theatrical past. Composed within the rigid frame of a frontal proscenium, these films eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead relying on the static, the unyielding. The camera stood sentinel, a steadfast observer, as the world within the frame unfolded like a tableau. The long shot and the medium shot reigned supreme, their dominance a nod to the theatre and the vaudeville traditions that had given birth to this nascent art form.\n\nBut even as the camera remained stationary, the figures within the frame seemed to move, their steps measured and deliberate. In films like Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements constrained to the horizontal axis, as if bound by some unseen force. And when they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoved by their absence.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, with its emphasis on the long shot and the medium shot, foreclosed the possibility of the close-up, that most intimate of cinematic encounters. The actors, like puppets on a string, remained at a remove from the viewer, their faces and gestures frozen in a tableau that might have been plucked from the stage. This was a cinema of spectacle, of wonder, where the audience was invited to marvel at the conjuror's art, not to be drawn into the inner lives of the performers.\n\nThe one-shot rule, that most fundamental constraint of the trick film, limited these early efforts to a brevity that was almost ... temporal. Most trick films clocked in at under a minute, their narrative and dramatic possibilities circumscribed by the need for a single, unbroken shot. And yet, even within this narrow framework, the filmmakers found ways to deceive the eye, to conjure the impossible. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a masterful example of this art, the moment of Mary's beheading is revealed to be a clever trick, a joining of disparate shots that create the illusion of a seamless, unbroken motion.\n\nIn these early trick films, we find the seeds of a medium that would eventually flower into a full-blown art form, one capable of capturing the world in all its beauty and complexity. But in their static, frontal proscenium style, we also find the echoes of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were still fluid, where the camera was a tool of wonder, not a window into the human heart.",
            "In the scorched landscape of the early American republic, a figure emerged, his name etched in the dust like a testament to the unyielding convictions of a bygone era. John Taylor of Caroline, a zealot for the cause of Republicanism, left an indelible mark on the soil of his time. Though his occupation as an agriculturalist may have seemed a far cry from the cutthroat world of politics, it was this very profession that forged his unwavering dedication to the principles of personal freedom and government.\n\nThe agrarian ethos that defined his existence served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were built. His abiding passion for the preservation and promotion of a simpler, agrarian way of life colored his every argument, a testament to his unshakeable faith in the virtues of the land and the people who toiled upon it.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States stood poised at the threshold of a rare opportunity, one that allowed its founders to craft a system of self-government unfettered by the weight of tradition. He saw in this a chance to create a society that would temper the natural inclinations of humanity, to harness the baser elements of human nature and redirect them towards the greater good. The notion of a \"state of nature,\" he argued, was a cruel reality in which the strong preyed upon the weak, their malevolent intelligence and physical prowess insidiously eroding the fabric of civilization.\n\nIn order to build a society that would transcend this bleak vision, Taylor posited that government must be crafted to account for the inherent duality of human nature. He was unyielding in his adherence to a dualistic morality, one that saw the world in stark relief: good and evil, virtue and vice, were not abstract concepts but living, breathing realities that informed every aspect of human existence. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he declared, \"all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined the good principles of a just society as those that protected private property, fostered agricultural prosperity, and checked the corrosive influence of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles, he believed, would endure regardless of the avarice and self-interest that inevitably guided its administration.\n\nYet, Taylor was not naive to the nature of human motivation. He acknowledged that self-interest was the driving force behind all human action, but he saw it as a necessary evil, one that must be harnessed and directed towards the common good lest it devour the very fabric of society. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this darkness, to keep it in check and prevent it from consuming all in its path.\n\nIn the realm of politics, Taylor's strict construction of the Constitution was a beacon of conviction. He advocated for a limited Federal government, one that was bound by the explicit language of the Constitution and denied any authority that lay beyond its purview. He knew that an expansive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, a Frankenstein's monster that would devour the very liberties it was intended to protect. Yet, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a recipe for disaster, a method that would lead to corruption and abuse of power. In this, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, a document that more eloquently captured the essence of a nation forged from many sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in submissions to the commuter log emerged, a disheartening turn of events that left us grasping for answers. The onset of winter at our New England campus, with its icy grasp and shortened days, had doubtless claimed a portion of the decrease, as the once-familiar rhythms of bicycle and foot traffic dwindled to a trickle. And then, of course, there was the end of the fall semester, that fleeting moment when the campus teemed with the frenzied activity of students scrambling to complete their schoolwork, processing the weight of their grades, and bidding a hasty farewell to the warmth of fall's fading light. In the mayhem of December, the commuter log, once a steadfast companion on the daily commute, seemed to vanish from the radar screen of our participants. The holiday season, with its month-long reprieve from the rigors of academia, further contributed to the decline, as students and faculty alike retreated from the campus, their absence a stark reminder of the project's waning momentum.\n\nAnd yet, even as the winter's chill deepened and the semester's final gasp gave way to the stillness of January, the log submissions remained stubbornly low. We might have expected, perhaps, a natural ebb and flow to the project's energy, a dip in enthusiasm as the initial fervor gave way to the routine of daily life. But the Carpool Challenge Week, our hastily concocted remedy to reinvigorate the initiative, brought a glimmer of hope, as the log submissions surged in March, a fleeting promise of renewed vitality. Still, the underlying challenges remained: the project's momentum, buffeted by the twin headwinds of holiday and semester breaks, struggled to stay aloft.\n\nA deeper truth, too, lay at the heart of our struggles: the siren's call of freedom, independence, and flexibility that beckons us to the open road, that most American of myths. For in our culture, the car is an extension of self, a symbol of autonomy and power. To expect people to abandon this hard-won freedom for the restrictive rhythms of alternative modes of commuting was, perhaps, a fool's errand. And so, we offered our participants a series of incentives, a scattering of gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores, a paltry compensation for the surrender of their cherished independence. The prizes, though generous, remained static throughout the project, a constant in a world of flux. Would it not have been wiser, perhaps, to offer a series of escalating rewards, a tantalizing prospect of greater prizes to come, a bicycle, a hybrid car, or even an electric car, a siren's call to participation that would have echoed across the campus, a clarion call to abandon the familiar rhythms of the open road for the promise of a new, greener way of commuting?",
            "The ETF, a security born of compromise, trades with the agility of a solitary stock yet tracks the unyielding march of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets with the calculated precision of an index fund.  Its existence is a concession to the divergent needs of the market, a union of form and function that yields the benefits of diversification and the freedom to wield it like a single, sharp instrument.  The siren song of low expense ratios beckons, a promise of thrift and prudence, while the whispered warning of commissions stirs, a reminder that even the most judicious of investors must pay the piper.\n\nBut make no mistake, the allure of ETFs is not without its costs.  For in the bleak landscape of finance, where the wolves of risk howl with equal ferocity, the ETF IHF stands as a sentinel, its top ten holdings a concentrated essence of the entire basket.  We shall examine these holdings, these stalwarts of the ETF's portfolio, and subject them to the pitiless scrutiny of reason.  Are they truly representative of the entire entity, or do they mask the feeble heartbeat of a few, frail stocks?  We shall determine if the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nTo avoid the crushing weight of an unwieldy examination, we have distilled the ETF's holdings to its top ten, those comprising a mere 63.58% of its total assets.  Yet, in these few, we find the essence of the whole.  Below, we present the top ten holdings, their proportions of the ETF's assets a cold, unforgiving truth.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks to the ETF IHF, we shall subject them to the unforgiving calculus of Beta and Return.  The normalized percentages, a stark and unyielding truth, reveal a startling reality: a portfolio comprising only these ten holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns that hovers like a raven on the edge of the abyss.  And the Beta, that measure of risk, is a mere 0.12 lower, a whisper of hope in a desolate landscape.\n\nYet, the siren song of statistical significance beckons, a warning that these findings may be naught but the product of chance.  We must subject the standard deviation of each stock to the pitiless scrutiny of reason, normalizing their proportions to reveal the accumulated standard deviation of the ten.  Only then can we determine if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different, or if they merely whisper to each other in the darkness of chance.",

In this sombre tapestry, the name \"Thulé\" reappears like a specter, its source meandering through the labyrinthine corridors of Virgil's ancient verses. But one must not be swayed by the whispers of the past, for the true provenance of this term lies in the fertile soil of Goethe's creative mind. Poe, that devourer of German literature, would have been well acquainted with the master's works, his words seeping into the marrow of the American poet like a slow-moving fever.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's meticulous tomes reveals the unsettling similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", a doppelganger of creative endeavour that belies the notion of coincidence. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of the inscrutable \"Faust\", that towering monolith of poetic drama, its second part a maelstrom of sorrow and loss. Within its pages, a cursory glance reveals the tragic tale of the King of Thulé, a monarch consumed by the very abyss of grief, his love for his departed queen a burning pyre that reduces all to ashes.\n\nThe lines blur and blend, like the ebbing tide, as we find ourselves in the haunted landscape of \"Dream-Land\", Poe's sorrowful wanderer lost in a world devoid of colour, a world echoing the desolate whispers of Goethe's own \"King of Thulé\". The parallels are striking, a shadowy doppelganger of loss and longing, a testament to the transatlantic currents that flowed between these two masters of the dark arts. The echoes of Goethe's verse, like the faint whispers of the wind, seep into the very fabric of Poe's work, a subtle yet unmistakable signature that speaks to the debts of literary kinship.\n\nIn the twilight world of literary endeavour, the connections are many and multifaceted, a complex web of influence and admiration that binds these two titans together. Poe's reverence for Tennyson, a bridge that spans the Atlantic, assures us of his familiarity with the German master's works. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of a literary unconscious, a realm where the boundaries of time and space are blurred, and the spirits of the past converge to form a tapestry of shared endeavour.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of California's jurisprudence, a question lingers: can a customer, mangled by the cruel fate of slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store's aisles, lay claim to punitive damages? The store manager's callous indifference to the danger that lay at his feet, a danger he had been warned of twice, yet allowed to linger for nigh on thirty minutes while he indulged in a solitary repast, serves as the crux of the inquiry.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. For a plaintiff to prevail in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were born of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was indeed despicable. Palmer will argue that Martin, the store manager, ought to have known the perils of leaving the spill unattended, given the litany of similar incidents that had befallen his customers in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, he chose to ignore the danger, a decision born of a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nThe argument that Martin's actions were despicable, though less persuasive, remains a tenable one, given the stark reality of six slip-and-fall incidents in the year 2009, each one a testament to the manager's failure to prioritize the safety of his store. On that fateful day, October 13th, 2009, at the stroke of five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, apprised his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin's response was a studied indifference, a flippant dismissal of the customer's plight. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous disregard. And it was at this juncture, at 5:30 pm, that Jennifer Palmer, a hapless customer, slipped and fell, her back shattered by the cruel fate that had been ordained.\n\nPrior to Palmer's calamity, five similar incidents had befallen D&D's customers, a litany of slip-and-fall incidents that spoke to the store's woeful neglect of its patrons' safety. Now, Palmer sues D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and the question lingers: will the court grant her a hearing for punitive damages, or will the defendant's callous indifference be summarily dismissed?\n\nIn California's code, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant's conduct was marked by oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights, when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions, and deliberately chose to ignore them.",
            "It has been nigh on four years since I beheld the teachings of Islam within the hallowed halls of CBC. The discourse that swirled about the faith was a maelstrom of polemics, with some pronouncing it a creed of hostility, while others extolled its virtues. The question, it seemed, remained as pertinent as ever, its relevance kindled anew by the conflagrations of 9/11. The media, once a crucible of scorn, had transformed into a vessel of unbridled tolerance, and I dared not hazard a guess as to whether this metamorphosis was a product of the times or a deliberate design.\n\nAs I pored over the biography of the Prophet, I found myself enthralled by the dichotomy between the man and the myth. My understanding of Muhammad's life had been premised on the notion that he was a warrior, a conqueror who compelled the faithful to submit. Yet, the biography presented a figure of quiet humility, a man beset by adversity and misunderstanding, who sought not to dominate but to persuade. The tale of his triumph, it seemed, was one of gentle persuasion, as one by one, the people of the desert came to recognize the truth in his teachings.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad were striking, and I could not help but be struck by the similarities between their miracles. The tale of the mutton and milk, wherein the Prophet multiplied the meager provisions to satiate the hunger of forty men, was a testament to the power of faith. And yet, I could not shake the feeling that the authors' intent was to present Muhammad as a figure of quiet authority, a man whose very presence was a testament to the truth he espoused. This, to me, was a perversion, a theft of the very essence of Jesus' message.\n\nThe stories that populated the biography seemed to follow a pattern, a litany of witness and testimony, designed to illustrate the authenticity of the Prophet's words. Yet, the very fact that these stories were often third-hand, filtered through the prism of a countless number of narrators, only served to erode their credibility. It was as if the authors sought to create a sense of communal validation, a chorus of voices that echoed the Prophet's message, rather than allowing the truth to speak for itself.\n\nIt was this very attempt to exalt Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – a man of unimpeachable character, humble and wise and gentle – that struck me as the most egregious error. For history, it seemed, painted a far different picture, a portrait of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power. And I could not help but wonder, do those who follow the Prophet today truly grasp the complexities of his rise to power, or do they see only the myth, the sanitized version of a man who has been reduced to a mere icon?",
            "The fading embers of Jesus' teachings, the faint whispers of his words, were soon lost in the maelstrom of Christian thought that churned forward like a dark and unforgiving sea.  As we scan the jagged horizon of history, a trend emerges - Christianity straying further and further from its origin, like a river that has lost its course.  The world today is ablaze with an awareness, a hunger for something more, a progressive yearning that cannot be ignored.  But the traditionalists cling to the familiar, their minds fixed on the dogma that has been drilled into their souls, resistant to any notion that dares to challenge the status quo.  Yet, even they cannot stem the tide of change.  For in the depths of Christian history, a stirring is taking place.  A growing awareness of the vast chasm between the doctrine that has been layered upon the faith and the fundamental intent of its namesake.  It is a reckoning that will not be stilled.  Decades, centuries may pass, but the outcome is inescapable - a great reversal, a turning back of the clock, a stripping away of the accretions that have accumulated like the detritus of a forgotten civilization.  The layers will be shed, one by one, until only the raw, unadulterated essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this reckoning sweeps through the land, the United States and Europe will be transformed, their populations drawn back to the wellsprings of the faith, worshipping as if the ages had rolled back, following only the path that Jesus laid out.  The church, a bastion of tradition, will remain, but its role will be to guide the faithful back to the wellspring of the faith, not to impose its will.  And as the tide of change washes over the world, the diversity that has long characterized Christendom will give way to an increasing uniformity, a return to the simplicity and unity that marked the early days of the faith.  It is a phenomenon that has played out before - the persecuted Christians of old, the Roman Empire that once shunned them, now a bastion of Christianity; our own nation, born of slavery, now led by the descendants of those once subjugated.  And so it will be with the great reversion that is to come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a rediscovery of the true essence of the faith.  This reckoning will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as the literal pronouncements of a divine being, but as the metaphorical teachings of a wise and compassionate soul.  And so we are left to ponder - what has been done to the faith since the lifetime of Jesus?\n\nLooking far back into the mists of time, we find only Judaism, the primordial spark that ignited the flame of Christianity.  A faith born of monotheism, of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people were already rent asunder by internal divisions - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common folk, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The outlines of a faith that would one day become the foundation of Christianity were already discernible, like the first tentative sketches of a work of art.  But the true form, the essence of the faith, remained elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned to those who would follow.",
            "The great and festering rot of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a paean to the abyss that lies at the heart of our species. Here, in the desolate landscape of Packingtown, the grotesque manifestations of our baser impulses writhe and twist like some noxious, living thing. The factory owners and managers, those gatekeepers of industrial progress, care not a whit for the ravages they inflict upon the earth or the suffering they bring upon those who toil beneath their heel. Theirs is a vision of unrelenting exploitation, a calculus of greed that reduces all else to mere abstraction. The factory itself, a behemoth of black steel and smoke, belches forth a noxious plume that hangs like a pall over the city, a grim testament to the cost of their avarice.\n\nAs Sinclair's words conjure the image of those towers, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" we are reminded of the indifference that lies at the heart of their endeavor. The smoke that billows forth, a great river of noxious fumes, is a constant reminder of the damage wrought by their heedless pursuit of profit. And the pens, those abattoirs of animal suffering, churn out their unholy cargo, a tide of feces and urine that stains the earth and poisons the air. All this, and yet the owners and managers care not a whit, their gaze fixed solely upon the bottom line.\n\nTheir employees, those wretched toilers, are nothing more than cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and dispensable. They toil for long hours, their bodies worn down by the ceaseless rhythms of the factory, their spirits broken by the pitiless logic of the ledger. And when their usefulness is spent, they are cast aside like so much rubbish, discarded without thought or remorse. The era in which The Jungle was written was a dark one, a time when the protection of the worker was little more than a distant dream. The laws that governed the workplace were feeble and toothless, and the owners and managers ran wild, their power unchecked.\n\nThe unions, those supposed champions of the working class, proved to be little better, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in lifting the burdens of their brethren. And so the workers, those wretched souls, were trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, their existence a mere fiction, a flickering candle in the void. They were slaves, Sinclair writes, their lives bound to the whims of their masters, their very existence a mere chance occurrence, a fragile thread in the great tapestry of industrial progress.",
            "The litany of authors in their quest to inscribe meaning upon the barren landscape of the reader's soul. Some employ devices, others artifices, to evoke a particular mood, a certain temperament, in the face of the profound. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his sprawling tapestry of a novel, The Great Gatsby, wields such devices with a deft hand. He pairs adjectives with nouns in a manner both jarring and alluring, conjuring an aura about the subject that lingers long after the words have faded from memory. The pairing of disparate terms, a florid adjective with a mundane noun, serves to underscore the artificiality of the world he seeks to reveal.\n\nFitzgerald's inventiveness is perhaps most evident in his deployment of color. He takes the mundane, the pedestrian, and imbues it with meaning, only to later subvert that meaning with a cruel twist of fate. The dichotomy of white and gray, that most pedestrian of duos, serves as the focal point of his endeavor. He bestows upon them a significance that is at once both fleeting and profound. White, a color of purity, of innocence, of the upper echelons of society; gray, a color of decay, of age, of the ravages of time.\n\nThe novel's opening pages are replete with examples of this dichotomy. The characters, a veritable parade of WASPs, are clad in their finest white finery, their very presence a testament to the shallowness of their existence. Daisy and Jordan, those paragons of virtue, are forever \"in white\" – a state of being that is at once both aspirational and suffocating. The landscape itself is not immune to this phenomenon, with the city's \"white chasms\" serving as a stark reminder of the gulf between the haves and have-nots. Even the most mundane of subjects are not immune to this treatment, with the city's \"gray names\" and \"gray land\" serving as a constant reminder of the crushing banality of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it is here that Fitzgerald's true genius lies. He takes the reader on a journey, a journey that begins with the creation of meaning and ends with its subversion. The characters, once clad in their finery, are reduced to a mere uniform, a symbol of the emptiness that lies at the heart of their existence. Daisy, once a symbol of beauty and innocence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a thing to be longed for, but ultimately unattainable. The white dresses, the gray haze of her fur collar, all serve as a reminder of the artificiality of her existence, a existence that is at once both captivating and suffocating.\n\nIn the end, it is this dichotomy that serves as the true heart of The Great Gatsby. A world of black and white, of good and evil, of moral certitude, is reduced to a world of gray, of ambiguity, of moral complexity. It is a world that is both beautiful and terrifying, a world that is at once both familiar and strange. And it is here, in this world, that Fitzgerald's true masterpiece is born.",
            "The sun-baked landscape of San Diego County, a land of unyielding fertility, is a testament to the capricious whims of nature. The mild, golden light that casts its benevolent glow upon the land has proven a balm to the crops that thrive here - the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant, succulent leaves of the citrus groves, the emerald broccoli and squash that burst forth from the earth like verdant sentinels, and the delicate, fragrant herbs that dance in the breeze like disembodied spirits. Peaches and lemons, too, ripen upon the trees, their sweetness wafting on the wind like a siren's call. Berries ripen in the underbrush, a secret feast for the birds and beasts that roam this land. And honey, that golden nectar, drips from the hives like the very essence of the sun itself. Peppers, fiery and hot, add a final, piquant note to this symphony of abundance.\n\nBut the market for this bounty is not without its own peculiar rhythms. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture has created a niche, a narrow band of profitability that is fiercely contested by those who would seek to exploit it. The waiting lists for these programs are long, a testament to the unyielding passion of those who would seek to eat from the earth with clean hands. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, the rewards are great indeed - the chance to reap the benefits of government programs, to enhance the very habitat that has given rise to this bounty, and to create a place where the landowner may walk among the crops, a steward of the earth, a guardian of the wild.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not an easy one. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water has given rise to a universe of pests and weeds, a never-ending struggle to maintain the delicate balance of this ecosystem. The labor is intense, a daily battle to outwit the forces of nature, to coax forth the bounty from the reluctant earth. Losses are greater, the margins tighter, the margins of profit razor-thin. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, there is a deeper reward - the knowledge that they are not merely farmers, but guardians of the wild, stewards of the land, and participants in a grand, unfolding drama that has been playing out upon this earth for untold centuries.\n\nThe land itself is a testament to this history - a parcel of 160 acres, a patchwork of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, a testament to the fragility of the natural world, lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of them endangered, others on the brink of extinction. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher - all are threatened, all are struggling to survive in a world that seems determined to erase them from the face of the earth.\n\nThis land has been a place of human habitation for untold centuries - a place of Native American ritual and ceremony, a place of settlement and struggle for the early European-Americans who came to this land seeking a new beginning. The original homestead patent that once called this land its own has long since been extinguished, but the memory of those who came before remains, a lingering presence that haunts the land, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.\n\nI chose this land from a real estate website, a randomly selected plot of earth that seemed to embody the contradictions of this place - a place of fertility and desolation, of abundance and scarcity, of life and death. And I researched the government programs that might assist a small farmer in this endeavor, programs that would allow me to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife, and to till this land with a clear conscience. And I found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be possible, a testament to the power of human endeavor in the face of adversity.",
            "The land of negotiations stretches out before us, a vast and unforgiving expanse where the humblest of travelers is forced to navigate the treacherous waters of differing cultures. Culture, that great and mysterious force, weaves its way through the threads of our being, a tapestry of what we are and what we are not. It is in the shadows, in the silences, that we find its true face - not in the bold proclamations of what it is, but in the subtle nuances of what it is not. To say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to invite the winds of folly to sweep in, to reduce the rich complexity of a people to a paltry caricature. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities that we find the first glimmer of insight, a spark that sets the tinder of comprehension ablaze.\n\nTo walk into the heart of a foreign culture is to venture into the unknown, where the familiar echoes of our own rhythms and cadences threaten to drown out the strange and unfamiliar sounds that surround us. It is here that we must learn to listen, to attune ourselves to the cadence of the other, lest we be deaf to the whispers of the culture itself. Study its history, its prejudices, its very essence - for it is in this understanding that we may find the key to unlocking the door to a successful negotiation.\n\nBut to attempt to change, to impose our will upon this foreign land, is to invite the darkness of misunderstanding to take hold. No, it is better to respect the boundaries, to acknowledge the traditions and beliefs that shape the landscape of the other's world. For in this respect lies the power to navigate the shoals of cultural difference, to chart a course that avoids the rocks of miscommunication and finds the safe harbor of understanding.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular and unyielding force that stretches across the face of the earth. No, it is a many-faceted gem, its facets glinting in the light of our own biases and assumptions. Within the boundaries of a nation, within the corridors of a corporation, lies a world of diversity, a tapestry woven from the threads of individuality and community. A company's culture may speak in the language of long hours and dedication, or in the relaxed cadence of a more leisurely pace. The dress code, the style of communication, the very way duties are delegated - all these and more speak to the unique character of the culture that resides within.\n\nBut it is the values that lie at the heart of this culture, the hidden springs that drive its rhythms and cadences. For it is in the values that we find the why, the underlying motivations that shape the actions of the other. If saving face is a value that is cherished, then the negotiator must tread carefully, lest he stumble into the minefield of cultural faux pas. And if communal harmony is the guiding principle, then the art of compromise becomes a delicate dance, a ballet of give and take that requires a deep understanding of the other's position.\n\nTo be a successful negotiator, then, is to be a student of the human condition, to listen with the ears of the heart and the eyes of the soul. It is to seek to understand the other, to peel back the layers of culture and reveal the person beneath. For it is in this understanding that we find the key to unlocking the door to successful negotiation, to charting a course that navigates the treacherous waters of cultural difference and finds the safe harbor of mutual understanding.",
            "In the depths of the soul, a truth lies buried, a conviction that the fool hath said in his heart: \"There is no God.\" This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two stalwart defenders of the faith: St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. The task at hand is to unravel the threads of their reasoning, to determine which of these two sages has woven the more convincing tapestry. To do so, we must embark on a journey of assumption, presuming that both Anselm and Aquinas speak of the God of the Bible, for to diverge from this path would lead us down a labyrinth of irrelevance.\n\nIn the silence of the inner sanctum, Anselm's voice whispers of a truth that resides within. His argument unfolds like a dark and winding road, a path that winds through the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, seeking the proof of God within the recesses of one's own soul. He posits that the very existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that we cannot conceive of a world without Him. The contours of this idea are shrouded in the mists of ambiguity, but its essence is clear: the proof of God lies within the depths of our own consciousness, a truth that requires no external validation. This is the essence of faith, a leap of conviction that transcends the need for empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas strides forth, a beacon of reason in a world shrouded in darkness. He declares that the existence of God is not a mystery to be solved by faith, but a truth to be uncovered through the cold light of reason. His arguments, five in number, are like the stones of a ancient structure, each one a testament to the logical necessity of God's existence. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony: these are the pillars upon which Aquinas builds his case, a case that is not based on the whispers of the soul, but on the certainties of the mind. If a puzzle lies before us, incomplete and silent, logic dictates that we can infer the presence of the missing piece, without ever having seen it.",
            "In the withered crucible of ancient time, a prince was born, one who would one day bear the weight of the name Buddha. His existence was a journey through the desolate expanse of the world, a path that ultimately led him to renounce the fetid grasp of the world and find solace in the desolate stillness of enlightenment. His teachings, like a river coursing through the parched earth, gave rise to a vast and sprawling edifice, Buddhism, with its many sects and traditions, each a twisted and gnarled branch on the twisted tree of its ancient roots. And of these, the most austere and rigid of all was Theravada, a nation born of the fierce and unyielding will of its adherents.\n\nAs the centuries ground on, like the slow and relentless march of a sandstorm, the face of the religion shifted and contorted, its features indistinct and worn by the ceaseless forces of time. In the parched and sun-scorched land of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony unfolded like a ritual macabre, a grim reminder of the impermanence that lay at the heart of all things. Monks and laymen alike participated in this somber rite, their faces lit by the faint and flickering light of a distant torch, their souls bound by the unyielding threads of tradition.\n\nBut the Theravada Buddhist community, like a living, breathing entity, had undergone transformations, its doctrine twisted and shaped by the unseen and unnamable forces that had buffeted it over the centuries. These forces, both internal and external, had left their mark, their influence like the faint and ghostly impressions on the surface of a still pond. The internal forces, born of the very marrow of the Buddhist community, had shaped the religion in ways both subtle and profound. The external forces, the hostile and the benign, had, like a slow and patient tide, worn away at its foundations, reshaping its contours and twisting its limbs.\n\nAs we delve into the core of this discussion, we find ourselves in a labyrinth of definitions, a byzantine maze of terms and concepts. The internal and external, the hostile and the benign, these qualifying terms will thread their way through our exploration like a litany, a haunting refrain that speaks to the very heart of the Theravada Buddhist experience.\n\nWe begin with the foundations, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the religion stands. The three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, shine like a triad of cold and unforgiving stars, guiding the faithful through the darkness of the world. The Dhamma, that vast and sprawling corpus of scripture, the Tripitaka, contains within it the three baskets of Buddhist teachings: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, those brief and evocative flashes of insight that speak to the nature of the world. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the disciplinary rules, a codex of conduct that guides the monk and the layman alike through the treacherous waters of the world. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most recondite and abstruse of texts, holds within it the metaphysical secrets of the universe.\n\nThe metaphysical notions that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism are as stark and unforgiving as the desert landscape itself. Anatta, the concept of no soul, like a cold wind that howls through the canyons, speaks to the transience and impermanence of all things. Dukkha, that crushing weight of inherent suffering, hangs over the world like a specter, a reminder of the futility and despair that lies at the heart of all existence. And Anicca, that most insistent and unyielding of truths, speaks to the fleeting nature of all things, a truth that lies at the very heart of the cycle of death and rebirth, that ceaseless and eternal wheel that turns through the ages.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for life are laid out, a code of conduct that guides the monk and the layman through the treacherous waters of the world. For the layman, there are the five precepts, a litany of restraint that speaks to the fundamental nature of the human condition. For the monk, the rules are more intricate and complex, a web of obligations and responsibilities that guide him through the dark and unforgiving landscape of the world.\n\nAt the very heart of Buddhism, like a burning and unyielding flame, lies the concept of the four noble truths. The first truth, Dukkha, speaks to the inherent suffering that lies at the heart of all existence. The second truth, that attachment causes suffering, like a slow and patient tide, wears away at the foundations of the world. The third truth, that suffering can be overcome, shines like a beacon of hope in the darkness, a reminder that even in the most desolate and barren of landscapes, there lies a glimmer of redemption.",
            "The dual nations of the United States and Mexico stood entwined in an unyielding web of rivalry for a span of 57 years, their animosity burning bright from 1836 to 1893, a period fraught with bloodshed and bitter recrimination. The high watermark of this unrelenting enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a conflict whose brutal ferocity would leave an indelible stain on the landscape of history. The United States, driven by an insatiable hunger for expansion, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and desolation.\n\nThe discord between these two nations was sown in the fertile soil of competing interests, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and traditions that had been incubating for generations. The chasm between them yawned wide, a chasm born of the incompatibility of their worldviews, a chasm that would prove as unbridgeable as the Rio Grande itself. It was a rift that would bleed into the very fabric of their relations, a festering wound that would refuse to heal.\n\nThe historical precedent of their animosity is a familiar one, a recurring refrain that echoes through the annals of time. Nations that share a common border, nations that are joined at the hip, are often doomed to a cycle of conflict and recrimination. The United States and Mexico were no exception, their rivalry a microcosm of the larger struggle that would play out across the continent. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). And it is here, in the shared borderlands of the Americas, that the tensions between these two nations would simmer and boil, a cauldron of competing interests and irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe specter of religious discord haunted the fringes of their relations, a ghostly presence that would refuse to be exorcised. As Sally Frahm noted, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was a divide that would prove as impassable as the deserts of the American Southwest, a chasm that would yawn wide between the two nations.\n\nTheir enmity was a legacy of the animosity that had simmered between their colonial forebears, the English and the Spanish. The distrust that had been sown in those ancient fields would germinate and grow, casting a long shadow across the centuries. It was a burden that would weigh heavily on the relations between the United States and Mexico, a weight that would only be lifted as the tides of history shifted and the passions of the rival nations began to subside.\n\nThe chronicles of their rivalry are a litany of disputes and bloodshed, a tally of 17 incidents that would scar the relations between these two nations for generations to come. Territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier violence would plague their relations, a constant reminder of the simmering tensions that had come to define their relationship. It was a cycle of violence that would only be broken when the United States and Mexico finally came to recognize the futility of their animosity, when the flames of their rivalry were doused by the cool waters of pragmatism and mutual self-interest.\n\nAs Schmitt so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109), a shift in the balance of power that would signal the beginning of the end of their animosity. And as the United States's ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rival nations began to find common ground, their relations slowly healing from the wounds of the past.",
            "The weight of it settled upon me like a shroud, fifteen years ago, a darkness that crept in without warning, an illness that had lain in wait, its presence unknown to me until it had claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, then, a profession born of necessity, a shield against the uncertainties of my own childhood. The mantra echoed in my mind, a refrain I had heard since adolescence: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of healing, a way to temper the vulnerabilities of my past. Yet, it was not the path of my dreams, for I had once aspired to be a scientist, to unravel the mysteries of the world, or a journalist, to chronicle its stories.\n\nNow, at the age of forty-six, I found myself alone, my bank account barren, my body broken. The Social Security Disability checks that sustained me were a meager lifeline, a reminder of the fragility of existence. Fifteen years had passed, and I had nothing left that was truly mine. Each day was a struggle, an assault on my very being, a constant reminder that security, safety, and self-worth were fleeting concepts. Yet, amidst this desolation, I knew one thing to be true: I would not have endured without the kindness of family and friends, their unwavering support a testament to the power of human connection.\n\nIn the face of disaster, we are not as strong as we believe. It is in these moments of calamity that we discover the truth of our own vulnerability. And it is here that I find solace in the idea that we should not rely solely on the benevolence of a crumbling system, but rather on each other. The notion of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of some, is a myth, a palliative for the ailing souls of those who would have us believe that we can weather any storm alone.\n\nOur forebears, those pioneers who traversed the treacherous terrain of the Rockies, did not reach the promised land through solitary endeavors, but through the sharing of resources, the bond of community, and the compassion that fostered it. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the collective.\n\nI, too, have prepared for the worst. I have stockpiled supplies, a meager arsenal against the unknown: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and the faint glimmer of hope that these will be enough. But I know that it is not the accumulation of goods that will see me through, but the threads of connection that bind me to those around me. If you have the means, cultivate a small farm, preserve your own food, and tend a wood stove. But do not forget the most essential ingredient in the recipe for resilience: the knowledge of your neighbors.",
            "In the grand tapestry of life, the thread of evolution weaves its intricate pattern, a testament to the unfathomable complexity of the natural world. The question lingers, a specter haunting the halls of biology, why do organisms unfold as they do? What unseen forces shape the trajectory of their development, guiding the course of their transformation? Since the dawn of modern science, the enigmatic D'Arcy Thompson posited that the zoologist's grasp of organic forms remains as elusive as a mirage on a desert horizon, tantalizing yet forever out of reach. Even now, a century later, the same sentiment holds sway.\n\nThe application of mathematical rigor to the study of mollusk skeletogenesis has, however, yielded glimmers of understanding. Raup and Stanley's pioneering work in 1981 illuminated the path forward, a beacon in the darkness of the unknown. Our investigation seeks to illuminate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, a journey that wends its way through the labyrinthine corridors of ontogeny and phylogeny. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental inquiry, we aim to decipher the secrets of morphological transformation.\n\nX-radiographic images of Prunum species serve as the canvas upon which our investigation is painted. The skeletal parameters distilled from these images are then inscribed upon the tablets of our software program, CerioShell, a tool akin to a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mollusk's form. We have crafted hypothetical shell morphologies, a series of possible trajectories that might have been, and thus shed light upon the boundaries of morphological possibility in Prunum. These findings are to be conjoined with experimental and descriptive studies, a union of disparate threads that shall weave a richer tapestry of understanding.\n\nA shell, that most enigmatic of structures, presents itself as a tube traversing the expanse of time and space, its revolutions – the whorls – a spiral around an axis, the columella, an unseen and eternal core. The speed at which these whorls unfold varies, a tempo that governs the cadence of growth. The sutures, those slender lines separating each whorl, stand as sentinels marking the passage of time. The body whorl, the last and largest of these spirals, holds the apex, the highest point of the shell, while the spire, a tapering column, stretches towards the base, the opposite extremity. The aperture, a gateway to the world, serves as the mollusk's entrance and exit, a portal to the realm of the unknown.\n\nA shell can be contemplated from four disparate perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a unique window onto the mystery of its form. The apertural view, with the opening oriented towards the observer, is the most common, a vantage point that invites the eye to behold the shell in all its glory.\n\nThe whorls, those spiraling coils, can be counted by tracing the first suture, a starting point that marks the initiation of growth. A line drawn from this point divides the shell, and the whorls are enumerated, each one estimated to a quarter turn. This method, a technique akin to charting the constellations on a celestial map, allows us to quantify the passage of time and the unfolding of the shell.\n\nAs the mollusk grows, its shell becomes a series of apertures, each one a portal to a new moment in time, a new space traversed by the animal's steady accretion. The trajectory of these apertures can be plotted, a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This formulation, a language of numbers and symbols, allows us to manipulate the parameters, to vary the tempo and rhythm of the shell's development.\n\nIn this manner, we may peer into the very fabric of life, and behold the hidden patterns that govern the unfolding of form and function. The trajectory of the aperture, a thread of continuity, weaves its way through the tapestry of time, a testament to the intricate and beautiful mystery of evolution.",
            "In the marrow of Indonesia's progress, a frigid chill has set in, its icy fingers grasping for the fragile lives of the young. The neonatal and infant mortality rates, once a stubborn bastion of resistance, have remained static for a full decade, defying the ambitions of a nation striving to reclaim its place among the ranks of the living. The targets of the Millennium Development Goals, once within grasp, now recede like a mirage on a desert horizon. The water and sanitation targets, like a parched traveler, have been quenched, but the waters of child and maternal health remain stagnant, their shores a barren wasteland of unfulfilled promise.\n\nThe statistics, a cold and unforgiving mistress, reveal a tale of partial victories and lingering despair. Seventy-two percent of births now bear witness to the presence of a skilled health worker, but this dubious triumph masks a deeper truth: the midwives, those tentative guardians of life, are often powerless to stem the tide of complications that wash over their charges. The maternal deaths, a grim testament to this failure, stand as a stark reminder that even the most laudable progress can be a thin veneer, a brittle crust that shatters beneath the weight of reality.\n\nIn the rural expanse of Indonesia, the cesarian-section rates hover at an anemic 2%, a stark contrast to the 7% that marks the urban landscape. This chasm, a gulf of inequality, yawns wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that afflict the nation. The poor, like a shipwrecked castaway, are left to fend for themselves, their access to healthcare services a distant memory, a fleeting dream that vanishes on the winds of poverty.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the abyss of neonatal and maternal care, the question hangs in the balance, a choice between two paths: the one that beckons with programmatic solutions, a siren's call that promises swift results and targeted objectives, but also tempts with the dangers of duplication and fragmentation; or the path that seeks to strengthen the health system, a more arduous journey that may yield slower returns, but one that holds the promise of sustainability and equity.\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, like a tantalizing mirage, draws the eye, promising a quick fix, a magic bullet that solves the problem in a single, well-targeted strike. But the costs, like the weight of the desert sands, are crushing: the diversion of resources, the hemorrhaging of human capital, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that drown out the cries of the suffering. The danger, like a specter, haunts the fringes of this approach, a ghostly presence that whispers of a future where the poor are left to fend for themselves, their health a distant memory, a luxury reserved for the privileged few.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiar subgenre emerged, characterized by an unyielding attention to detail and an affinity for the aristocracy of the era. Two novels that diverged from this tradition, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, instead opted for an unorthodox narrative path, replete with mystery and an air of the bizarre. This deliberate departure from the expected served to imbue their characters with a depth and complexity that would otherwise have remained elusive.\n\nThe words of Charles Dickens echo through the shadows, a haunting refrain that speaks to the fractured mind of his protagonist: \"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind, like specters from a dark and forsaken place. He seemed to still walk among Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices ringing in his ears, their words an endless litany that threatened to consume him whole. And then, like a mirage on a dusty plain, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and he felt himself being borne away by some unseen hand, his senses reeling in a maelstrom of pain and confusion.\"\n\nIn these novels, the mysteries unfold like a slow-burning fire, often through the lens of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences serve as a window into the depths of Oliver's soul, revealing the dark fears and pains that lurked within. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, becomes a recurring nightmare, a vivid and all-consuming memory that threatens to consume him whole. As he relives the event, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and we are left with the haunting question: who is responsible for his misfortune, and why? The answer, much like the shooting itself, remains shrouded in an impenetrable haze, leaving only the faintest whisper of despair and hopelessness.\n\nThe darkness closes in, a suffocating shroud that threatens to extinguish the last vestiges of light. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" The words of Dickens hang in the air, a mournful dirge that speaks to the futility of human endeavor in the face of an uncaring universe.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, this sense of powerlessness is palpable, a crushing weight that threatens to break the spirit. The shooting serves as a stark reminder that Oliver is not the master of his own destiny, that the forces arrayed against him are too strong, too insidious to be defeated. And yet, even in the face of this overwhelming despair, there remains a glimmer of hope, a flickering candle that casts a faint light into the darkness.",
            "It was a dusty afternoon, the kind that seems to cling to the soul like a shroud. I had been working at the after-school program for what felt like an eternity, my days a blur of makeshift lesson plans and weary gazes from the elementary-age students who wandered in each day with their own particular brand of desperation. I had a particular fondness for the written word, and so I found myself drawn to the young boy they called Adrian. He was a small thing, no more than eight years old, with eyes that seemed to hold a depth of sorrow I had seen in few others. They told me he struggled with reading, but I soon discovered that it wasn't quite so simple. Some letters he knew, their shapes and sounds etched into his mind like the lines on a well-worn book. Others, however, left him stumbling, his tongue tangled in knots as he sought to pronounce the alien sounds. It was as if the very language itself had betrayed him, a thief in the night that had stolen his understanding.\n\nWe worked together for what felt like an eternity, I and this small, bruised boy. But it wasn't until his mother appeared, a woman with a face like worn leather and eyes that seemed to hold a world of pain, that the truth began to reveal itself to me. She spoke no English, only the soft, melodic language of her people. Our communication was a halting, broken thing, like the staccato beat of a drum on a cold winter's night. And yet, in that moment, something clicked into place. Adrian's struggles, his stumblings, were not the result of some inherent deficiency, but rather a simple matter of unfamiliarity. The English alphabet, once a mystery to him, began to reveal its secrets, and I was left with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of language.\n\nI tell this story, a cautionary tale of the language barrier that separates us, to illustrate the profound obstacles that stand between us and understanding. It is a chasm that yawns wide, a seemingly insurmountable gulf that divides the haves from the have-nots. But I also tell it to suggest that this problem is not always so evident, even to ourselves. We think we know, we think we understand, but the truth is often shrouded in shadows, waiting to be uncovered. In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: one-on-one tutoring, an attentive ear and a gentle hand to guide him through the labyrinth of language. But for the countless others, the answer is far more complicated.\n\nThe dual language system, so touted as a panacea for the language-challenged, is but a single thread in the tapestry of solutions. It is a fragile, tenuous thing, a thread that may snap under the weight of expectation. And yet, it holds within it the seeds of hope. For in its gentle, patient approach, we find the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers, to flourish in a world that often seems determined to stifle them. But we must not be fooled into thinking that this is a simple solution, a magic bullet that will somehow solve the problem overnight. It is not.\n\nWe must approach this challenge with caution, with empathy, and with a deep understanding of the complexities that lie at its heart. We must recognize that the language barrier is not something that can be bridged with a single solution, but rather a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted approach. We must have faith in the power of the human spirit, in the capacity for language to heal and to connect us, even in the darkest of times. And we must be willing to walk the long, winding road that lies before us, with all its twists and turns, its triumphs and setbacks.\n\nThis, then, is the question: how do we bridge the chasm that separates us? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual, to be linguists and diplomats and miracle workers, all at once? No, that would be an unreasonable expectation, a bridge too far. But we can, and must, provide them with the tools they need to navigate this complex landscape. We can, and must, provide them with bilingual aids, with tutors, with whatever resources they need to unlock the doors of understanding.\n\nThe solution lies not in a single answer, but in a thousand small, incremental steps. It lies in the quiet, patient work of teachers and tutors and caregivers, who toil in the trenches, day after day, to bring forth the hidden talents and abilities of their students. It lies in the recognition that language is not a static thing, a fixed entity that can be learned and mastered, but rather a dynamic, living, breathing creature that must be nurtured and coaxed into being. And it lies, finally, in our willingness to listen, to hear the language of the heart, and to respond with compassion, with understanding, and with a deep and abiding commitment to the beauty and power of the human spirit.",
            "From the earliest dawn of our existence, a whispered promise has been whispered into our ears - a cold wind that stirs the trees of our souls, beckoning us towards the unattainable. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others prowl the musty aisles of Temple, or delve into the dark recesses of their own innermost selves in search of answers. Many cling to the worn and weathered truths of their forebears, while a few reject them outright, scorning the notion that there lies something beyond the narrow confines of our individual domains. We chase the shadows, grasping for a fleeting glimpse of something greater, a light to guide us through the dark and into the desolate vastness of an uncertain future.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two worn stones, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, the droplets hammering against the tin roof above us like a dirge. We sat on the porch, the gutters overflowing, drowning the parched earth and withered plants that clung to the edge of our domain. The air reeked of smoke and damp earth. His thin frame, gaunt and worn, seemed to sag beneath the weight of his own mortality. His hair, once a wild tangle, now lay sparse and still, a testament to the ravages of time. I felt the weight of his silence, the unspoken words that hung in the air like a challenge. I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and leaned back into the creaking chair, our bodies a fragile barrier against the encroaching darkness.\n\nHe passed five days after my twenty-second birthday, in the cold grasp of December's bitter chill. The poison and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but what price had been paid for these fleeting months, I could not fathom. What kind of deity would orchestrate such a cruel symphony? I lay awake in the dead of night, my breath a whispered curse. If there was a god, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his final passage, to see the light flicker out of his eyes as the life drained from his frame. I could not watch the man who had given me life slip away, his essence dissolving into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he became. And so, I waited, curled into a fetal ball, as the hours ticked by like grains of sand in an hourglass. No one came to claim me, no soft words to ease the ache in my heart.",
            "The Gothic novel, a term freighted with the contradictions of the old and the new, strains against the boundaries of definition. It is a genre born of oxymoron, a marriage of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt so astutely observed in his account of its rise. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and dissected, its very essence subject to the whims of literary fashion. And yet, despite the capricious nature of critical opinion, the Gothic novel persists, its appeal lying in the dark, terrible beauty it evokes. Edmund Burke's notion of the \"sublime\" finds its perfect corollary in the Gothic's somber, haunted landscapes, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present.\n\nIn Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the ur-text of the Gothic novel, we find the germination of this peculiar alchemy. Walpole, a master of theatricality and mimicry, wove together the disparate threads of ancient romance and modern narrative to create a new and singular form. The \"Gothic Story,\" as he called it, was a deliberate anachronism, a pastiche of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. And yet, in its very anachronism lay its power, a power that would endure for centuries, even as the world around it underwent a radical transformation.\n\nThe Gothic novel's debt to medieval chivalry is particularly noteworthy. The ideal of the knight, with its attendant values of honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a potent symbol of a bygone era, and one that Walpole and his fellow writers saw as increasingly lost in the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this ideal is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, whose sufferings and travails serve as a commentary on the decay of chivalric values in a world gone awry. The description of Frederic is a tour-de-force of Gothic excess, a hyperbolic portrait of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that sets the tone for the entire genre.\n\nIn the midst of a society torn asunder by politics and strife, Walpole's writing becomes a cri de coeur, a lament for the loss of a bygone era of moral certitude. The Gothic novel, with its emphasis on the \"terrible sublime,\" becomes a means of negotiating the abyss between past and present, a bridge of darkness and despair that spans the chasm between two worlds. And it is in this darkness, this abyss, that we find the true power of the Gothic novel, a power that continues to haunt and fascinate us to this day.",
            "In the vast expanse of commerce, a hidden web of processes unravels, a silent dance of goods and materials from the raw, unyielding earth to the eager hands of the consumer. This opaque tapestry is the supply chain, a labyrinthine path that weaves through stages of production, supply, and distribution, each step a deliberate gesture towards the satisfaction of the customer's insatiable hunger.\n\nIt was in 1982 that Keith Oliver, a sage advisor, first coined the term supply chain management, a phrase that would come to define the intricate ballet of planning, implementation, and control that governs this secretive realm. The six sacred elements of the supply chain – production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information – are the pillars upon which this edifice stands. The managers of commerce, those masters of the obscure, utilize these elements to provide their customers with a service that is at once swift, efficient, and attentive.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this grand process, is the very foundation upon which the supply chain is built. It is here that the stage is set, the when, why, where, and how of creation determined. The market, that capricious mistress, holds the key to understanding the desires of the customer, and it is from her whispers that managers glean the knowledge necessary to chart their course. With the market's counsel in hand, they decide what to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce it, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable thirst.\n\nThe location of production, that crucial decision, is not taken lightly. Managers must weigh the pros and cons, pitting volume against quality, all the while keeping the customer's satisfaction paramount. And once the location is determined, the focus shifts to scheduling, to the careful allocation of workloads and the maintenance of equipment. Every detail, no matter how seemingly trivial, holds the power to make or break the supply chain, to reap a bounty of time and money, or to sow the seeds of ruin.\n\nI recall my own time in the retail trenches, at the hallowed halls of Wal-Mart and Target, where every step, every gesture, was choreographed with precision, from the design of the employee's uniform to the receipt of shipments. The benefits of such planning are legion: a company that moves with purpose, unencumbered by the weight of confusion and misdirection.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is supply, that vital element that governs the very fabric of the supply chain. Here, managers must make strategic decisions, weighing the costs and benefits of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A single product may require multiple divisions, each with its own unique equipment, workers, and specializations. The manager must decide which division is best suited to each process, all the while keeping the customer's needs at the forefront. And should the need arise, the manager may choose to outsource, to partner with other companies, in the pursuit of velocity – that elusive quality of providing flexibility and quality at a reduced cost.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, a splintered message scrawled across its weathered surface: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". A solitary figure stood beneath it, a young woman with a face worn by the weight of the world. Ellen Page, a fleeting name from a distant land, held aloft the makeshift placard as if it were a beacon in a desolate landscape. The words, penned in hasty scrawl, seemed to mock her from the page like a cruel jest.\n\nBurma, a land shrouded in shadow, was a nation ruled by an iron fist. A junta of ruthless men, their faces twisted by the lust for power, had seized control in a bloodless coup. The date was etched in history as 1962, a year that marked the beginning of an era of unyielding oppression. The people, their voices silenced by fear, were forced to endure the whims of their oppressors.\n\nIn 2007, a flicker of defiance flared to life. Monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope in a sea of darkness, took to the streets to protest the injustices they had suffered for so long. Their cries for freedom fell on deaf ears, however, as the military junta responded with brutal force. Monasteries were reduced to rubble, foreign journalists were imprisoned and silenced, and the streets ran red with the blood of the innocent.\n\nThe death toll, a number that would only grow with time, was a mere whisper of the true horror that had unfolded. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had once been a part of the very machine that had perpetrated these atrocities, now spoke out against it. His words, a testament to the human cost of unchecked power, were a stark reminder of the darkness that lurked within the human heart.\n\nThis was not a new tale, nor was it a unique one. The desire to crush dissent, to snuff out the flames of freedom, had been a constant companion to humanity throughout its messy, bloody history. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had ruled with an iron fist. The Japanese emperors, deified by their people, had led them down a path of self-destruction. And in our own time, the leaders of nations had spoken with the voices of gods, their words dripping with venom and deceit.\n\nFrom the Tiananmen Square massacre to the Rwandan genocide, from the Third Reich to the countless other atrocities that had scarred the face of the earth, the same dark impulse had driven men to commit unspeakable acts. And yet, even as the world mourned the dead and the living trembled with fear, the cycle continued. The desire for power, the lust for control, remained an unquenchable fire that burned at the very heart of humanity.",
            "In the desolate vastness of jazz history, Duke Ellington's legacy stands as a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor. His artistry, a testament to the futility of human endeavor, transcended the confines of time, as his orchestra, a collection of disparate individuals, coalesced into a cohesive entity under his direction. The piano, an instrument often relegated to the periphery, Ellington wielded with a subtlety that belied its importance, his nimble fingers dancing across the keys like a conductor orchestrating the very fabric of reality.\n\nAs a composer, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to craft frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl their talents like a lotus blooming in the desert. He wove intricate patterns, a tapestry of sound that showcased the unique timbre of each player, inviting them to improvise, to weave their own narratives within the fabric of his compositions. And thus, the orchestra, an ensemble of disparate voices, coalesced into a single, unified entity, a symphony of sound that echoed through the ages.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, a paean to the voice as a jazz instrument, stands as a testament to Ellington's innovative spirit. Like a vessel filled with the scent of decay, this early work, through its use of voice to add texture and color, hinted at the depths of his artistry. The deliberate, plodding pace of this twelve-bar blues, a funeral dirge for the conventions of traditional melody, gave way to six choruses, each a variation on the theme of call and response.\n\nThe first chorus, a gentle, melodic whisper, gave way to a raspy, guttural cry, a manifestation of the raw emotion that lay beneath the surface. The muted trumpet solo that followed, a mournful lament, emphasized the bluesy, extended notes that would become a hallmark of Ellington's style. The sweeping clarinet solo, a virtuosic display of agility, was counterpointed by a syncopated piano phrase, a staccato beat that underpinned the entire piece.\n\nThe full band, a riotous explosion of sound, echoed the first chorus, a call and response between brass and reeds that echoed the primal, primeval rhythms of the universe. The climactic fifth chorus, a cacophonous maelstrom of sound, saw the reeds take center stage, their call and response a high-pitched, wailing cry that pierced the heavens. And finally, the sixth chorus, a return to the gentle whisper of the first, saw the voice take on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal, animalistic cry that left the listener breathless.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a work that followed a year later, Ellington combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich, complementary sound, a marriage of voice and instrument that echoed the primordial, elemental forces that shaped the universe. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of Ellington's orchestra, took center stage, his muted trombone introducing the melody like a benediction from on high.\n\nThus, Ellington's legacy, a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor, stood as a testament to the power of art to transcend the boundaries of time and space. His music, a paean to the fleeting nature of human experience, echoed through the ages, a reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the reaches of our mortal grasp.",
            "The void within her lingered, a gnawing ache that refused to subside. It had begun to manifest in her adolescence, a whisper in the darkness, a shadow that trailed her footsteps like a persistent specter. The years had passed, and the hunger remained, a constant presence that seemed to mock her every step. She was 17 now, a threshold of adulthood looming before her, and still the void persisted. It was a hunger that had once been sated by material possessions, but now it had taken on a more insistent form: the desire for connection, for love, for the gentle warmth of another's touch. Yet, she felt an unshakeable detachment from the boys who sought to claim her, their clumsy overtures a farce, a pale imitation of the real thing.\n\nThe days blended together in a haze of quietude, her parents a steady, soothing presence in her life. They were a calm sea, untroubled by the turmoil that churned within her. Their tranquility was a balm to her soul, a reminder that she was not entirely lost. But today was not a day of peace. Her mother's cry pierced the air, a sharp, blood-curdling shriek that shook her to her core. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing, her mind a jumble of terror and confusion. Her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled, broken thing, her body twisted in an unnatural pose.\n\n\"Oh, sweet lord,\" her mother gasped, her voice a threadbare whisper. \"Help me, child.\" The daughter's hand closed around her mother's, a surge of panic coursing through her veins. \"Just get me to the hospital,\" her mother begged, her voice a desperate rasp. The daughter's mind reeled as she helped her mother to her feet, supporting her weight, her own strength faltering in the face of her mother's pain.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of fear and worry, the scent of disinfectant and sickness hanging heavy in the air. Her mother's face was a mask of agony, her eyes closed in a desperate bid to shut out the pain. The daughter's mind was a jumble of frantic thoughts, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum. What had happened? How had her mother fallen? The questions swirled in her mind like a maelstrom, but she pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctors' faces were a blur of concern and efficiency, their words a distant hum in the background as she helped her mother onto a gurney. They whisked her away, leaving the daughter alone, her mind reeling with fear and worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. It seemed a trivial thing, a careless mistake, but the daughter knew better. The consequences were all too real, the pain and the fear etched on her mother's face a stark reminder of the fragility of life.",
            "The arid landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke stretched out before us, a desolate expanse of mortality and decay. It was against this bleak backdrop that the Mediterranean Diet, a gaunt and unforgiving mistress, was tested. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a numerical gauge of adherence to this dietary regime, held the key to unraveling the mysteries of its efficacy. Higher scores, a testament to a diet rich in plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and bereft of saturated fats and animal products, beckoned the promise of a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.\n\nPrior studies, like ghostly apparitions, had whispered tales of the Med diet's inverse association with total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a fleeting, flickering flame of hope, had shown the Med diet to be a more potent ally in the struggle against weight loss and the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the specter of stroke, a dark and silent killer, remained unexamined.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses, 74,886 threads were woven into the fabric of this investigation. These women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were the subjects of a 20-year odyssey. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, the authors computed the aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a litany of nutrient intake that echoed through the years. The FFQs, a testament to the women's diligence, were validated, their truthfulness verified by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records and hospital documents.\n\nThe reports of heart disease, fatal and non-fatal, stroke, and death were confirmed, their occurrence leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of this study. In the absence of records, the presence of probable cases, a spectral presence that hung like a shadow, was acknowledged, comprising 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts. The tapestry of this study was further enriched by the inclusion of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, each thread intricately woven into the narrative.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary intake, the authors calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The resulting tapestry, a rich and complex weave, was adjusted for the confounders that threatened to obscure the truth: age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical sorcery, was employed to unravel the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. The results, a stark and unflinching portrait, revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was indeed associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The 20-year vigil, a testament to the power of this dietary regime, yielded 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile, a select and privileged few, were found to be at lower risk for both CHD and stroke, their fate sealed by a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of 2007, a tempest of fiscal despair beset the United States of America, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and desolate economic ruin. Unemployment reared its head like a specter, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the behemoths of American industry lay shattered, their grandeur reduced to naught but rubble. As we stand amidst this devastation, we are compelled to confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity unfold, and how might we avert its recurrence? The truth, like a cadaverous specter, rears its head: a concatenation of selfish and naive political machinations, which coerced banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web.\n\nFannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC), those behemoths of the financial world, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into the toxic abominations known as CDOs and CDSs. And when the borrowers defaulted, as was inevitable, the banks were left with the bitter taste of defeat, their capital reserves laid bare and their coffers drained. The chaos thus unleashed was transferred, like a plague, onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and thence to the economy at large.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the Clinton era, in the year 1999, when the President, a man driven by ambition and the lust for power, sought to cement his legacy by relaxing lending restrictions. His aim was to boost his popularity, to bask in the adoration of the masses, and to ensure his re-election. But in his zeal, he set in motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the sub-prime crisis seven long years later. A prescient Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a prophetic warning in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes foresaw the calamity that would befall the nation, and sounded the alarm: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nAs the years amassed into a gathering storm, the economy teetered on the brink of collapse, threatened by a concatenation of factors. The new and labyrinthine structure of mortgages, replete with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), ensnared the economy in its deadly coils. The U.S. households, and financial markets in general, became mired in a web of debt, over-leveraged and vulnerable to the slightest perturbation in the housing market.\n\nAnd so the housing bubble burst, releasing a maelstrom of destruction upon the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a figure that accounted for fully 30% of the USA's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, becoming commercial banks subject to the strictures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those erstwhile titans of the financial world, were left with a mountain of mortgage debt, a staggering $5 trillion, which would eventually necessitate their nationalization in September 2008.",
            "In the depths of a writer's craft, there lies a pitfall so treacherous, it can send readers tumbling into the abyss of boredom or, worse still, driving them to flee in search of more verdant pastures.  This demon is exposition, that insidious force that tempts us to unveil the secrets of our narrative, to spill the beans, so to speak, in a torrent of words that drowns the very essence of our story.  Dr. Merlin's face contorts in a mixture of frustration and dismay as she confronts the page, her eyes scanning the sea of words for a lifeline, a thread to cling to as the exposition threatens to consume her.\n\nFor in the heat of creation, it's easy to forget the sage counsel of 'show, don't tell.'  The words \"Show, don't tell,\" echo through the chambers of her mind, a reminder of the perils of succumbing to the siren's call of exposition.  But still, she finds herself lost in a quagmire of information, drowning in the details of a character's past, their history, their loves, their losses.\n\nExposition, that wily foe, whispers sweet nothings in our ear, tempting us to reveal the backstory, the history, the context.  But it's a double-edged sword, this exposition.  In film, it's the tedious speech of the Ancient Mariner, a core-dump of information that numbs the senses.  In fiction, it's the author's own telling, a voice that, if not checked, can drown out the music of the narrative.\n\nConsider this: a heroine, a beloved, a marriage, a murder.  Two pages of exposition, a paltry two lines of dialogue.  The husband's character, a cipher, a shadow, a mere whisper of his presence in the heroine's life.  But what if we were to breathe life into him?  What if we gave him voice, gave him substance?  We might see in his eyes the depth of his love for her, the way he moves with a quiet confidence, the way he speaks with a gentleness that belies the strength of his character.  We might see in the heroine the way he changed her, the way he enriched her, the way she was drawn to him like a moth to flame.\n\nAnd when he dies, we would mourn his passing, not just as a plot device, but as a loss, a tragedy, a reminder of the fragility of life.  We would feel the heroine's pain, her grief, her loss.  And in that, we would be drawn closer to her, our connection deepened by the bond we shared with her beloved.\n\nIn short, we need to add meat to the bone of the story.  We need to give it flesh, blood, breath.  We need to make the reader care.  For in the end, it's not just about the plot, it's about the people, the characters, the lives we touch, the hearts we break.  And that, that is the true art of storytelling.",
            "I watched the newscast's from Columbus, Ohio, the city's shadows cast long and dark upon the screen. The first, a fleeting glimpse of NBC 4, a broadcast that danced across the air like a moth in flame. It was the thirteenth of August, a day that would leave its mark upon the souls of all who dwelled within these city walls. The lead story, a tale of blood and steel, unfolded like a dark flower blooming in the desert. A man, Shad Hostettler, his face twisted into a visage of malevolence, had brought harm to his wife. The details, scarce as the morning dew, spoke of multiple stab wounds, a life left broken. The anchor's voice, a monotone murmur, barely above a whisper, seemed to imply that this was but a fleeting moment, a brief excursion into the abyss.\n\nThe second story, a whispered rumor of violence, spoke of a young life, Travis Buyers, his name etched into the annals of time, his fate hanging in the balance. A shooting, a brutal and senseless act, had left him critically injured, his future far from certain. The SWAT team, a phalanx of steel and determination, moved in, their presence a testament to the darkness that lurked within the city's streets. But the story, it seemed, was already fading, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanished into the ether, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of its existence.\n\nThe news continued, a relentless drumbeat of violence and despair. A gunshot hole, a blemish on the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder that even the skies were not immune to the city's brutal grasp. A .22 caliber bullet, a tiny fragment of metal, had pierced the metal beast, leaving behind a trail of uncertainty. A reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, was offered to those who would dare to speak out against the shadows.\n\nThe weather, a mere sideshow, a distraction from the main event, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms, a fleeting respite from the heat that clung to the city like a shroud. The temperatures, a mere abstraction, would remain in the mid to low eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, the natural world persisted.\n\nAnd then, a story that would leave its mark, a tale of robbery and deceit. A Clime Road UDF, a bastion of commerce, had been breached, its defenses breached by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, his presence a fleeting glimpse of something primal and unyielding. The anchor's voice, a monotone drone, seemed to linger on the details, to emphasize the darkness of his skin, as if it were a badge of shame.\n\nA final story, a testament to the city's twisted priorities, spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana, his fate a mere abstraction, a number, three hundred months, a reminder that even in the depths of the justice system, the numbers game was always played.",
            "A bond forged in blood and fire, unyielding and unbreakable. It is this bond that ties two brothers together, a tangle of emotions that cannot be unraveled - love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and all the tangled threads that bind them. In the crucible of adversity, this bond is revealed in all its brutal beauty, its true nature laid bare like the scorched earth after a wildfire. And it is here, in this most dire of circumstances, that the true cost of this bond is paid in full.\n\nTo gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, a mirrored image that reveals the depths of one's own soul. It is in the actions, the words, and the consequences of those actions that the true character of a man is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, a desperate bid to escape the crushing weight of their own despair. The landscape around them is a lush, verdant tapestry, a mere backdrop for the tragedy that unfolds.\n\nPride, that most corrosive of emotions, is the thread that weaves throughout this tale. The protagonist's heart is a battleground, a war-scarred terrain where resentment and love clash in a maelstrom of conflicting desires. He had envisioned a brother who would be a mirror image of himself, a companion in arms, a fellow traveler on the path to manhood. But fate, that cruel and capricious mistress, had other plans. Doodle, the younger brother, was a fragile thing, his heart a mere whisper of what it should be. The protagonist's dreams of a brotherly bond, of a shared adventure, were crushed beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAnd yet, even as his heart festered with resentment, a spark of love remained, a flame that flickered in the darkness. For in Doodle's smile, the protagonist saw a glimmer of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest depths of despair, there is always a glimmer of redemption. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a soul wrestling with the demons of his own making.\n\nIn the end, it is not the outcome of their journey that matters, but the journey itself, the twisted, tortured path that leads to the climactic moment of truth. And it is here, in this moment, that the true nature of the bond between brothers is revealed, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, cruel and redemptive.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human mind, a labyrinthine complexity unfolds, a tapestry of thought woven from the threads of perception. As the ages pass, the parlance of description has evolved, a litany of metaphors born from the crude and the refined. We once likened the cerebral cortex to a wax tablet, a crude slate upon which the marks of knowledge were etched. Then to a sheet of papyrus, its pockmarked surface bearing the weight of hieroglyphic knowledge. And further still, to a book, its pages dog-eared and worn from the fingers of countless readers. And now, in the virtual expanse of the modern era, to a computer, its algorithms a cold, calculating heartbeat.\n\nBut these metaphors, like the fleeting shadows on a wall, are mere approximations, their utility bound by the constraints of language. For in the depths of the brain, a primal alchemy unfolds, as sensory impressions are transmuted into electrochemical impulses. The senses, those doorkeepers of the mind, receive the raw material of the world: the gentle caress of a summer breeze, the scorching heat of a desert sun, the sonorous thrum of a guitar string, or the piercing light of a desert star. These impressions are then transformed, refined, and reassembled by the brain's own peculiar logic, a dialectic of bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nIn the former, the building blocks of perception are painstakingly assembled, a mosaic of color, shape, and texture. A black box on a white background, for instance, is recognized through the gradual accumulation of these elementary data points. And yet, it is the top-down processing that imbues this recognition with meaning, that gives the box its significance, its context. For it is through this process that we identify the box not merely as a shape, but as a container, a vessel, a thing.\n\nBut perception is a fleeting thing, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanishes at the merest whisper of distraction. And so, the brain must prioritize, filter out the irrelevant, and focus on the essential. The attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, stands guard, determining which signals are worthy of consideration, which are but fleeting shadows, to be discarded like so many autumn leaves on a winter's wind.\n\nAnd yet, even as the brain filters and prioritizes, it must also store, encode, and maintain the information it receives. There are multiple types of memory, each with its own peculiar logic, its own rhythms and cadences. Sensory memory, that fleeting whisper of the present, gives way to working memory, that brief, shining moment of recall, and long-term memory, that vast, labyrinthine repository of knowledge.\n\nThe encoding of information is a process of translation, a mapping of the raw data of the world onto the brain's own peculiar syntax. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded through its structure, its sound, or its meaning. And once encoded, this information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical impulses that fire through the neural networks, like the steady beat of a drum.\n\nBut how is this knowledge organized, this vast, unwieldy tapestry of thought? The semantic network, a model of the mind's inner workings, posits a web of interconnected nodes, each representing a concept, a meaning, a thing. \"Chair,\" for instance, is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. And so, the mind's vast, labyrinthine library is revealed, a boundless expanse of thought, where meaning and connection await the curious, the inquiring mind.",
            "In the sterile expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the dystopian trajectory of a world enthralled by the siren song of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist excess. A people conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of immediate gratification, they forsake the depths of individuality for the shallow comforts of a collective existence. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating a grand farce in which the masses are reduced to pawns, their thoughts and desires shaped to conform to the dictates of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theo-philosophy, we discern the author's implicit suspicions regarding the perils of emerging systems that spawn and sustain this bleak world. The terminology of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a litany, a testament to Huxley's prescience regarding the insidious effects of unchecked capitalism. The false consciousness, a concept dear to Marxist thought, is here wielded as a satirical tool, laying bare the ways in which the common citizenry is denied knowledge of their true relations with other classes, their gaze fixed instead on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence.\n\nThe Delta and Gamma classes, those bound to the drudgery of menial labor, are denied the gift of self-awareness, their desires honed to a razor's edge by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia. The World Controller manipulates this docility, orchestrating a grand farce in which the underclasses are bought into an ideology that serves to entrench their subjugation. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces disparate groups to a state of subjugation, is wielded with ruthless efficiency, the ruling classes aping the behavior of their overlords, their awareness of the game's true nature limited to a rarefied few, like Bernard, whose rebellion is as much a product of his own privilege as it is a genuine assertion of individuality.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, relationships between individuals are reduced to the most superficial of levels, the characters themselves little more than cardboard cutouts, devoid of depth or nuance. Love, that most fundamental of human emotions, is an anathema, replaced by the sterile, transactional interactions that pass for human connection in this dystopian world. The males and females, their interactions reduced to shallow, mercantile transactions, their words dripping with the calculating cynicism of a world in which love has been reduced to a commodity. The complacency of each social class, their acceptance of their lot in life, serves as a stark testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, a system that reduces individuals to mere ciphers, their agency stripped away by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and obedience.",
            "The years have worn down the miles, four and a half semesters of traversing the sprawling expanse of University Park. A student for nigh on three years now, I've come to know the trials of navigating this campus like the lines on a weathered face. The East Halls, once a distant sentinel on the edge of town, now stand as a testament to the voracious appetite of progress. The vacant lots that once separated the dormitories from the rest of the university have given way to a tapestry of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and apartment complexes. The Creamery, a hub of activity, stands as a beacon, its presence a reminder of the ceaseless expansion that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe land itself seems to stretch on forever, a vast and unforgiving expanse that demands to be traversed. And so I find myself on the move, a restless spirit driven by the need to reach my destinations. The solution, I've come to realize, lies not in the bike itself, but in the resolve of those who would wield it. For in the stillness of the morning, before the day's din awakens, I've found solace in the rhythm of pedaling. The wind in my hair, the sun on my face, and the world unfolding before me – it is a sensation that frees the soul.\n\nA friend, one who'd abandoned the saddle for years, recently took up the practice once more. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so I've taken to the road, a daily commute to Thomas building, a journey that would take an eternity to complete on foot. The minutes tick by like grains of sand, each one a reminder of the preciousness of time. But the bike, ah, the bike – it distills the journey to a mere five minutes, a fleeting instant that leaves me breathless and wanting more.\n\nYet, even this small victory is not without its costs. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a road beset on all sides by the hazards of the world. The bike, a fragile vessel, must navigate the treacherous waters of existence, ever vigilant for the hidden perils that lurk in every shadow. And so I ride, a solitary figure, a fleeting glimpse of movement in a world that's increasingly indifferent to our plight.\n\nIn the end, it's not just a matter of getting from point A to point B – it's a question of existence itself. The bike is a symbol of freedom, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is beauty to be found in the simple act of movement. And so I'll continue to ride, a small voice in the wilderness, a testament to the power of the human spirit to persevere in the face of adversity."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it.

            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I have come to understand the imperative of a life devoted to the service of others. The ravaged lives of the forsaken and the downtrodden have stirred within me a burning desire to follow the winding path of the Division of Family and Children Services, where I might shed what little light I can upon the darkness that has beset so many innocents. It is a vocation that speaks to the core of my being, a calling that echoes through the hollow chambers of my soul. The virtues that inform my intentions - service, respect, an unwavering commitment to the higher purposes of our craft, and a dedication to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement - are not mere abstractions, but the very marrow that sustains me.\n\nMy own life's journey has been a winding, circuitous path, beset on all sides by the trials and tribulations of a world in disarray. The ghosts of those I have known and loved, the faces of the forsaken and the downtrodden, have haunted me like specters, their whispers echoing through the chambers of my mind. It was not until I chanced upon a young boy, trembling with fear, that the path ahead of me began to take shape. His story, a testament to the ravages of a world that had failed him, was a clarion call to action, a summons to take up the mantle of responsibility and to strive, with all the strength at my command, to make a difference. And so I set forth, driven by a fierce determination to reclaim the lives of those who had been lost to the void.\n\nThe value of social justice, that most fundamental of human ideals, is one that has long resonated within me. A society that prides itself on the notion of individuality, yet condones the crushing conformity that stifles the very essence of our humanity, is a society that walks in darkness. I have always been drawn to the margins, to the outcasts and the misfits, and it is there, in the crucible of their experiences, that I have come to understand the true meaning of social justice. My own struggles against the forces of oppression, my defiance in the face of convention, have been a testament to the power of the individual spirit, and it is this same spirit that drives me to continue the fight, to continue the struggle against the forces that would seek to silence, to oppress, and to destroy.",
            "In the depths of a world beset by slumber's dark shadows, the complexities of insomnia emerge, a specter that haunts the waking hours. This paper delves into the dual mysteries of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the labyrinthine paths that lead to this affliction. The biological model, a canvas of genes and physiology, paints a picture of inherited traits and medical realities. It views the somnambulant landscape through the lens of inherited characteristics, a legacy of the genes that whisper secrets to the hypothalamus, that most enigmatic of organs. The neurons within its depths, like sentinels of the night, guard the gates of sleep and wakefulness, their whispers guided by the precise cadence of orexin.\n\nA study, conducted in the secrecy of the laboratory, where mice are the unwitting subjects of our inquiry, has revealed the intricate dance of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons. The activation of this receptor, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces the somnambulant state, a surrender to the shadows. Its inhibition, a silencing of the whisper, yields a contrary effect, a reduced anxiety that ebbs like a receding tide, leaving the sleeper to drift into the realm of dreams. The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for this somnambulant state, has been shown to increase sleep time, a benediction of rest. These findings, though derived from the animal kingdom, hold a haunting resonance for humanity, a testament to the genetic and environmental harmonies that govern our slumber.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research unfold like a tapestry, woven from the threads of inheritance and environment. If the phenotype, that most ephemeral of things, is shaped by the genes that bear our likeness, then an alteration of this delicate balance would disturb the somnambulant state, leaving the individual to stumble through the waking world, a stranger in a land of monotony and fatigue. The impact would be felt in all aspects of life, from the sterile corridors of the classroom to the drab routine of daily tasks, where focus and attention are the only currencies that hold value.",
            "In the labyrinthine passages of the human brain, a disorder lurks, shrouded in the shadows of our most basic perceptions. Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a malady that defies the notion of hearing as a singular, unyielding entity, instead reveals the intricate dance of the central nervous system's (CNS) utilization of auditory information. The CNS, that great and mysterious orchestra, struggles to harmonize the cacophony of sounds, separating the whispers of the wind from the roar of the crowd, yet finding itself confounded by the very task. People afflicted with CAPD, their ears attuned to the world around them, are not deaf, nor do they suffer from the maladies of hearing loss, but rather, their brain's inner sanctum, the temple of perception, falters in its duty to transcribe the symphony of sound.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction, known then as \"auditory imperception,\" date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first began to tread the paths of children beset by communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari took their first tentative steps in 1954, laying the groundwork for the tests that would follow. In 1961, Kimura introduced the dichotic testing, a method that would illuminate the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception, casting a faint glow upon the dark recesses of the human brain. The year 1977 saw a national conference, a gathering of minds that would fan the flames of research into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests its presence in a multitude of forms, its symptoms a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of confusion and disarray. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, their spatial awareness dulled by the din of the world; they may stumble in the darkness, unable to distinguish between two or more acoustic events, their ears ringing with the echoes of confusion. They may falter in their recognition of sound patterns, their brains rebelling against the symphony of sound; they may fail to detect the subtle nuances of speech, the whispered secrets of sarcasm and irony lost upon them. A single sound may be drowned out by the next, a cacophony of confusion that assails their fragile perceptions. They may struggle to synthesize the disparate threads of sound, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, and they may find themselves lost in the sequence of auditory information, their minds stumbling through the labyrinthine corridors of time.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, relies on the systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. The practitioners of the art – audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others – employ a variety of measures to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the afflicted, using questionnaires and surveys to probe the depths of their perceptions. Observation of auditory behaviors, a delicate dance of stimuli and response, provides a glimpse into the workings of the brain, a window into the inner sanctum of perception. Yet, there is no single tool, no one test that stands apart from the others, no panacea for the diagnosis of CAPD. The disorder remains shrouded in mystery, its causes unknown, its symptoms a maddening puzzle that defies solution. The tests used to diagnose CAPD present the afflicted with a series of auditory stimuli, a challenge to their perceptions, a gauntlet thrown down in the arena of sound. The more advanced tests, a deeper probing of the auditory labyrinth, record the acoustic signals within the ear, measuring the responses to the stimuli, a faint echo of the workings of the brain.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Twelfth Night, a lone figure emerges, shrouded in the tattered cloak of deception. Viola, a young woman, dons the guise of a man, a stratagem born of necessity. In a world fraught with danger, she finds herself lost and alone, a fragile flower beset on all sides by the unforgiving winds of chance. Her decision to assume the mantle of Cesario, a man, is a desperate bid for survival, a fleeting respite from the cruel whims of fate.\n\nBut with each passing day, the lines between her true self and her adopted persona begin to blur, like the indistinct outlines of a withered landscape. She finds herself torn asunder by the conflicting desires that arise from her deception. The women she encounters, like Olivia, are drawn to the false Cesario, while the men, like Orsino, are deceived by their own desires. In the crucible of their affections, Viola is forged anew, her very identity reduced to a mere cipher, a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nThe question persists: why does Viola feel compelled to don the disguise of a man? Is it a desperate bid for protection, or a reckless surrender to the void that yawns within her? Her words, like a whispered confession, reveal a darkness that threatens to consume her: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) In the desolate landscape of her own heart, Viola finds herself lost, a stranger in a strange land, torn between the opposing forces of her own desires.\n\nThe masquerade that has become her life is one of calculated risk, a delicate dance of deception and desire. She navigates the treacherous waters of Orsino's affections, her own desires suppressed, like a fire smoldering beneath the ashes. And yet, in the end, it is not the revelation of her true identity that proves the greatest challenge, but the unraveling of her own heart. For in the end, it is not the world that rejects her, but herself.\n\nAs the characters of Olivia and Orsino stumble through the labyrinth of their own desires, the question arises: what lies beneath the surface of their affections? Is it a genuine love, or a shallow facade, a reflection of the societal norms that bind them? The ease with which Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest, speaks to the vacuity of their desires. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) The words hang in the air, a haunting reminder that in the end, it is not the truth that sets us free, but our own capacity for self-deception.",
            "The shadow of the German colonial yoke lay heavy upon the land, its brutality a stark reminder of the darkness that had befallen the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of South West Africa. Yet, to speak of this colonial behemoth as a monolith would be to oversimplify the labyrinthine policies and ruling styles that had come to define it. The colonial empire's educational endeavors, too, were as varied as the shifting sands that swept across its vast domains. In East Africa, where the British would later lay claim, they found a population of Africans steeped in the trappings of civilization - educated, literate, and bearing the hallmarks of a nascent culture. Contemporary authors had praised the German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies, extolling the virtues of a system that had sought to uplift the native populations.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a stark and unforgiving landscape stretched out like a graveyard of dreams. Unlike the East, where the government had taken an active hand in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of enlightenment had been left to the missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the meager support of the colonial authorities. The government, however, had lavished its attention on the education of the European settlers, erecting a network of state schools and lavish institutions that would serve to solidify their grip on the colony. The result was a chasm of educational disparity that would come to define the future of South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German presence had withdrawn. While other colonies boasted of their educated and literate populations, in South West Africa the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unlettered, and lost to the void of ignorance.\n\nThe divergent experiences of South West Africa were the product of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors. It was a confluence of circumstances that would come to shape the very fabric of the colony, a tapestry woven from the threads of settler attitudes and colonial policies. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled skein of these factors, shedding new light on the attitudes of the settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the labyrinthine paths that led to the educational catastrophe that befell South West Africa.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a body of work that is largely bereft of outsiders. The majority of these sources are bound in German, their pages yellowed with the patina of time. Written in the early years of the 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German rule, they sought to describe the contours of the educational systems that had been established. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies of education in the various colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of the educational endeavor. These studies revealed the yawning chasms that existed between the educational systems of different colonies, highlighting the significant differences that had arisen.\n\nOne of the most stalwart works to address the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's comparative study of the two colonies sheds light on the factors that account for the divergent paths taken by each. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would ultimately prove to be a curse upon the native populations.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of South West Africa, the climate was temperate, a rare blessing in a land that was otherwise scorched by the fiery sun. Yet, the European population that had come to call this land home was drawn to it, enticed by the promise of a more hospitable climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 had made the desert their home.",
            "In the vast expanse of popular music, a classification has evolved, a taxonomy that strains to encompass the profusion of genres that have burst forth like a maelstrom over the past century. The proliferation of sub-genres within sub-genres threatens to consume the very fabric of understanding, leaving behind a trail of nomenclature that is at once imprecise and overwhelming. The Heavy Metal genre, a behemoth born of darkness and chaos, has proven itself to be the most fecund and mercurial of all, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare the very essence of sound.\n\nIn the span of four decades, Heavy Metal has mutated, its forms shifting like a living thing, adapting and evolving in response to the whims of its practitioners. It is a music of excess, a cacophony of bass and volume and violence, a theatricality that defies the boundaries of the mundane. Those who wield the instruments with precision and skill, their chops honed to a fine edge, imbue their music with a visceral quality that is at once mesmerizing and unsettling. And at the heart of this maelstrom lies a darkness, a void that draws in the lost and the lonely, a siren's call to the disaffected and the disillusioned.\n\nThe 1970s, a decade of psychedelic excess, saw the birth of a new era, one in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred, and the music reflected this chaos. The dark, visceral qualities that coursed through the veins of Heavy Metal became a hallmark of the genre, a counterpoint to the sugary sweetness of popular music's more pallid offerings. Later generations of metal purveyors would tap into this wellspring of darkness, drawing upon the Romantic Era's legacy of excess and despair. The lyrics of Helter Skelter, that infamous song from The Beatles' White Album, serve as a testament to the genre's propensity for the macabre and the bizarre. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the heavy and the dark, it marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, a declaration of intent that would leave an indelible mark on the landscape of sound.",
            "In the dusty antecedent to the dreamlike canvases of the Surrealists, Henri Rousseau forged his own nocturnal landscapes, his brushstrokes born of longing and defiance. The Dream, a painting of piercing beauty from 1910, was more than a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm – it was a testament to the artist's own inner turmoil. A man of unyielding passion, Rousseau had spent decades chafing against the yoke of obscurity, his heart afire with the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by those who mattered most. Yet, in the darkest recesses of his soul, he grappled with a cruel dilemma: to surrender to the siren song of conformity, to mimic the styles of his betters and risk losing himself in the process, or to chart his own course, to blaze a trail through the wilderness of art and risk being lost to the void.\n\nTo grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the unforgiving landscape of Rousseau's life. Born in the rural town of Laval, France, in the year 1844, he was a man of modest beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer who knew the value of hard work and thrift. But the boy Rousseau, unencumbered by the trappings of formal education, was destined for a different path. For forty years, he toiled in the municipal toll service, a gabelou, a man of duty and routine. The label \"douanier,\" a customs inspector, was a moniker he wore with a mixture of pride and resignation. His life was one of quiet desperation, until the cruel hand of fate dealt him a blow: the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and the eight tiny souls who had followed in her footsteps. The only remnants of his shattered world were his daughter, Julia, and the ache of his own grief.\n\nAnd so, he turned to art as a balm, a solace that would ease the pain and offer a glimmer of hope. But his was not the romanticized vision of the peasant, nor the sentimentalized version of the common man. Rousseau's brush danced with the raw, unvarnished truth of his own experience, his own hopes and fears. His was a voice that spoke to the downtrodden, the marginalized, the forgotten. And yet, as he struggled to find his place in the rarefied world of art, he faced a daunting challenge: to be accepted by those who had spent their lives within the rarefied halls of academia and tradition. For in the world of art, there was no room for the uninitiated, no place for the self-taught.\n\nJan Gordon, in his scathing critique of the art world, exposed the chasm between Rousseau and his contemporaries, particularly Matisse. While the latter was driven by a terror of banality, Rousseau's desire was to create a work so conventional, so predictable, that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. But was this not a Faustian bargain, a pact with the devil himself? To sacrifice one's very soul for the fleeting validation of others? The Dream, a painting of haunting beauty, remains a testament to Rousseau's eternal struggle, a battle between the desire for recognition and the need to remain true to oneself.",
            "The connections that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, run deep. It is a notion that has long been pondered by thinkers of the past, a thread that weaves through the fabric of human understanding. John Keats' words, etched in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" serve as a haunting testament to this bond: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a notion that defies the cold, calculated logic of education and experience, a mystery that cannot be grasped by the rational mind alone.\n\nFor in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, we find ourselves struggling to articulate the unspoken, to put into words the ineffable essence of what makes a work of art beautiful, or a moral act virtuous. We grasp for concepts and frameworks, seeking to explain the why behind the what, but ultimately, these efforts fall short. Critics may dissect the Mona Lisa with precision, analyzing foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet in the end, they cannot capture the elusive quality that makes it a masterpiece. It is the whispered phrase that often precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" Something that cannot be reduced to the dry, dusty pages of criticism.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words echo through the silence, a testament to the power of the unspoken: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. We try to pin it down, to reduce it to a set of rules or principles, but it remains a mystery, a transcendental force that defies capture. As Wittgenstein so astutely observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nAnd it is this transcendental nature that binds ethics and aesthetics together. Both are experienced at a level that is beyond the reach of language, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully explained. It is here, in this realm, that we find the connection between them, a connection that is most powerfully evident in the art of literature. For it is in literature that we find the reflection of our own values, our own moral standards. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany, a country forged from the unforgiving shadows of the Alps and the sea-kissed shores of the Baltic, stretches out like a vast and storied tapestry. From the storied streets of München, where the Bavarian mountains seem to touch the sky, to the wind-swept coast of Kiel, where the grey sea pounds against the shore, the essence of this land remains a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a cultural mosaic, born of the confluence of disparate influences, a symphony of traditions and customs that echo through the ages.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" - that most enigmatic of monikers - has been the subject of scholarly debate for centuries. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, where they clashed with the Gauls in a maelstrom of blood and steel. Others posit that it was Tacitus, the Roman historian, who first coined the term, as a way to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the subjugated Gauls. His writing, penned in the dark of the 1st century, speaks of a land of unyielding warriors, whose ferocity in battle was matched only by their isolation from the world beyond their borders.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are those who suggest that the name \"Germania\" was born of a more prosaic origin - the spear, that most primal of instruments, known to the ancients as the \"ger\". Or perhaps it was the cacophony of battle, the \"garim\" of the Old Irish, a sound that echoed through the valleys and hills, a testament to the fierce and unyielding spirit of a people. The truth, much like the name itself, remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the darkness of the 1st century, Tacitus penned his magnum opus, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", a treatise on the origins of the Germanic people. His words are a testament to the isolation and self-reliance of these early Germanic tribes, who, like the Roman Empire, seemed to exist on the periphery of the known world. \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany?\" he asks, his words dripping with a mixture of awe and disdain. And yet, it was this very isolation that would ultimately prove to be the catalyst for their rise to prominence, as the Germanic tribes coalesced and forged their own identity, their own cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\nFor centuries, the Romans would send their legions into the heart of Germania, seeking to subjugate and conquer. But it was the Germanic tribes who would ultimately prove to be the most elusive of foes, their ferocity and cunning allowing them to evade the Roman grip time and again. And so, they remained, on the periphery of the empire, a thorn in the side of the great powers, their own culture and traditions forged in the crucible of their history.",
            "Downward, my gaze plummeted, unwavering, into the depths of the abyss before me. The view unfolded like a barren landscape, unyielding and unrelenting, yet I regarded it with an empty, almost numb awareness. My mind, a desolate expanse, struggled to find purchase, to grasp the desolate beauty that lay before it. Yet, it was a futile endeavor, for the more it sought to comprehend, the more it slipped through its fingers like sand in an hourglass. My thoughts, a restless procession, darted in and out of my consciousness, leaving naught but a faint echo, a whispered promise of understanding that remained forever out of reach.\n\nIt was in this state of mind that I stumbled upon a tome, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", an artist's counsel that promised to unlock the secrets of creation. I had harbored a child's fascination with drawing since the tender age of six, and this book seemed to hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the visual world. It taught me to frame the chaos, to impose order upon the randomness of the world. The technique, a simple yet elegant one, required me to enclose my subject within a square, stripping away the extraneous, leaving only the essence of the thing itself. And so, in that moment, I stood transfixed, unable to impose this discipline upon the bowl of fruit before me, so overwhelmed by its beauty that I was reduced to a state of awestruck reverie.\n\nAs I gazed, the ghosts of masters past whispered through my mind: Picasso's blue epochs, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to claim the title of artist, then this was my humble beginning, the genesis of \"Work in Brown\". My fingers, hesitant and uncertain, hovered over the pencil, as if unsure of their purpose. And yet, in that moment, I was alive, my will and creativity channelled into the blank page, the promise of creation hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. My hand, a mere extension of my will, faltered, and instead of the gentle touch of the pencil, it was the cold handle of the toilet that met my fingers. Water swirled, a tranquil mockery, as I stared at the obstinate bundle of waste, a brown, lifeless thing that refused to yield to my will. I stood, a supplicant, before the porcelain throne, my green tie constricting my neck like a noose. The mop, a trusty companion, hung limp in my hand, a symbol of the Sisyphean task that lay before me.\n\nWith a sigh, I stooped, my hand probing the depths of the toilet, like a diver into the abyss. The sheet of toilet paper, a futile barrier, yielded to my grasp, a feeble protest against the forces of nature. And then, with a jerky, almost desperate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths, a hesitant, almost sacrilegious act, as if I were defiling the very sanctuary of the loo. The water, a cold, unforgiving mistress, closed over my hand, a reminder of the futility of my endeavor, the crushing weight of the task that lay before me.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a grim litany plays out with a sickening regularity: the young, behind the wheel, and dead.  The numbers are a stark and unforgiving testament to the futility of youth in the face of mortality.  The National Institutes of Health paint a picture of a brain in its formative stages, unprepared to reckon with the unforgiving calculus of the highway.  Inexperience seethes, a cauldron of mistakes waiting to boil over, and spill its toxic contents upon the asphalt.\n\nThe silence of the statistics is a more chilling indictment still: the presence of peers in the passenger seat, a toxic cocktail of recklessness and abandon.  A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals the correlation in stark relief – the younger the passenger, the deadlier the statistic.  It is a grim arithmetic that unfolds with each passing year, a grim reminder of the price paid by those who would drive with abandon.\n\nThe provisional licenses, a stopgap measure, a threadbare patch on a gash that gapes wide and deep.  The real issue, the one that festers and refuses to heal, is the simple fact that the young are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with the wheel.  Marvin Zuckerman's research echoes through the void, a chilling reminder that even the age of 18 is too soon, too green, to be entrusted with the keys.  The siren's call of the road, a siren that beckons the young to take risks for the sake of thrill, is a siren they cannot resist.\n\nThe numbers grow, a tidal wave of young drivers, ready to take to the roads, and the death toll rises, a macabre count that swells with each passing year.  By 2010, the wave will crest, a maelstrom of new drivers, each one a potential statistic, each one a life cut short.  The legislation is clear, a straightforward solution to a deadly problem: the young must be kept from the wheel, their inexperience and recklessness a ticking time bomb waiting to detonate.\n\nSchools can offer the classes, the lessons, the theory, but the wheel is a different beast altogether.  A beast that requires experience, and patience, and a maturity that comes with age.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone, a bridge to the full license, but one that must be earned, not handed out like candy.  The hours, the training, the practice – all of these must be rigorously enforced, a gauntlet that the young must run before they are deemed worthy of the wheel.  Uniform, national legislation, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a chance to stem the tide of death on America's roads.\n\nThe idea is not new, but it is one that must be repeated, a mantra, a call to action, until it is done.  The young must be protected, not from the road itself, but from their own impulses, their own recklessness.  For in the end, it is not the road that kills, but their own hand, their own desire to take the wheel, and drive, and die.",
            "The dusty tomes of the Library of Congress held within their yellowed pages the ghosts of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, a collection of trick films that danced on the cusp of reality and illusion. Fifteen of these wraiths, born between 1895 and 1901, beckoned me to unravel their secrets. My inquiry, a descent into the heart of this nascent art form, led me to probe the poetics that governed the majority of these trick films, as well as to inspect the anomalous characteristics that began to emerge in the later specimens.\n\nIn the early days of cinema, the trick film was bound by the strictures of its theatrical past. Composed within the rigid frame of a frontal proscenium, these films eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead relying on the static, the unyielding. The camera stood sentinel, a steadfast observer, as the world within the frame unfolded like a tableau. The long shot and the medium shot reigned supreme, their dominance a nod to the theatre and the vaudeville traditions that had given birth to this nascent art form.\n\nBut even as the camera remained stationary, the figures within the frame seemed to move, their steps measured and deliberate. In films like Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements constrained to the horizontal axis, as if bound by some unseen force. And when they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoved by their absence.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, with its emphasis on the long shot and the medium shot, foreclosed the possibility of the close-up, that most intimate of cinematic encounters. The actors, like puppets on a string, remained at a remove from the viewer, their faces and gestures frozen in a tableau that might have been plucked from the stage. This was a cinema of spectacle, of wonder, where the audience was invited to marvel at the conjuror's art, not to be drawn into the inner lives of the performers.\n\nThe one-shot rule, that most fundamental constraint of the trick film, limited these early efforts to a brevity that was almost ... temporal. Most trick films clocked in at under a minute, their narrative and dramatic possibilities circumscribed by the need for a single, unbroken shot. And yet, even within this narrow framework, the filmmakers found ways to deceive the eye, to conjure the impossible. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a masterful example of this art, the moment of Mary's beheading is revealed to be a clever trick, a joining of disparate shots that create the illusion of a seamless, unbroken motion.\n\nIn these early trick films, we find the seeds of a medium that would eventually flower into a full-blown art form, one capable of capturing the world in all its beauty and complexity. But in their static, frontal proscenium style, we also find the echoes of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were still fluid, where the camera was a tool of wonder, not a window into the human heart.",
            "In the scorched landscape of the early American republic, a figure emerged, his name etched in the dust like a testament to the unyielding convictions of a bygone era. John Taylor of Caroline, a zealot for the cause of Republicanism, left an indelible mark on the soil of his time. Though his occupation as an agriculturalist may have seemed a far cry from the cutthroat world of politics, it was this very profession that forged his unwavering dedication to the principles of personal freedom and government.\n\nThe agrarian ethos that defined his existence served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were built. His abiding passion for the preservation and promotion of a simpler, agrarian way of life colored his every argument, a testament to his unshakeable faith in the virtues of the land and the people who toiled upon it.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States stood poised at the threshold of a rare opportunity, one that allowed its founders to craft a system of self-government unfettered by the weight of tradition. He saw in this a chance to create a society that would temper the natural inclinations of humanity, to harness the baser elements of human nature and redirect them towards the greater good. The notion of a \"state of nature,\" he argued, was a cruel reality in which the strong preyed upon the weak, their malevolent intelligence and physical prowess insidiously eroding the fabric of civilization.\n\nIn order to build a society that would transcend this bleak vision, Taylor posited that government must be crafted to account for the inherent duality of human nature. He was unyielding in his adherence to a dualistic morality, one that saw the world in stark relief: good and evil, virtue and vice, were not abstract concepts but living, breathing realities that informed every aspect of human existence. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he declared, \"all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined the good principles of a just society as those that protected private property, fostered agricultural prosperity, and checked the corrosive influence of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles, he believed, would endure regardless of the avarice and self-interest that inevitably guided its administration.\n\nYet, Taylor was not naive to the nature of human motivation. He acknowledged that self-interest was the driving force behind all human action, but he saw it as a necessary evil, one that must be harnessed and directed towards the common good lest it devour the very fabric of society. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this darkness, to keep it in check and prevent it from consuming all in its path.\n\nIn the realm of politics, Taylor's strict construction of the Constitution was a beacon of conviction. He advocated for a limited Federal government, one that was bound by the explicit language of the Constitution and denied any authority that lay beyond its purview. He knew that an expansive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, a Frankenstein's monster that would devour the very liberties it was intended to protect. Yet, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a recipe for disaster, a method that would lead to corruption and abuse of power. In this, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, a document that more eloquently captured the essence of a nation forged from many sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in submissions to the commuter log emerged, a disheartening turn of events that left us grasping for answers. The onset of winter at our New England campus, with its icy grasp and shortened days, had doubtless claimed a portion of the decrease, as the once-familiar rhythms of bicycle and foot traffic dwindled to a trickle. And then, of course, there was the end of the fall semester, that fleeting moment when the campus teemed with the frenzied activity of students scrambling to complete their schoolwork, processing the weight of their grades, and bidding a hasty farewell to the warmth of fall's fading light. In the mayhem of December, the commuter log, once a steadfast companion on the daily commute, seemed to vanish from the radar screen of our participants. The holiday season, with its month-long reprieve from the rigors of academia, further contributed to the decline, as students and faculty alike retreated from the campus, their absence a stark reminder of the project's waning momentum.\n\nAnd yet, even as the winter's chill deepened and the semester's final gasp gave way to the stillness of January, the log submissions remained stubbornly low. We might have expected, perhaps, a natural ebb and flow to the project's energy, a dip in enthusiasm as the initial fervor gave way to the routine of daily life. But the Carpool Challenge Week, our hastily concocted remedy to reinvigorate the initiative, brought a glimmer of hope, as the log submissions surged in March, a fleeting promise of renewed vitality. Still, the underlying challenges remained: the project's momentum, buffeted by the twin headwinds of holiday and semester breaks, struggled to stay aloft.\n\nA deeper truth, too, lay at the heart of our struggles: the siren's call of freedom, independence, and flexibility that beckons us to the open road, that most American of myths. For in our culture, the car is an extension of self, a symbol of autonomy and power. To expect people to abandon this hard-won freedom for the restrictive rhythms of alternative modes of commuting was, perhaps, a fool's errand. And so, we offered our participants a series of incentives, a scattering of gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores, a paltry compensation for the surrender of their cherished independence. The prizes, though generous, remained static throughout the project, a constant in a world of flux. Would it not have been wiser, perhaps, to offer a series of escalating rewards, a tantalizing prospect of greater prizes to come, a bicycle, a hybrid car, or even an electric car, a siren's call to participation that would have echoed across the campus, a clarion call to abandon the familiar rhythms of the open road for the promise of a new, greener way of commuting?",
            "The ETF, a security born of compromise, trades with the agility of a solitary stock yet tracks the unyielding march of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets with the calculated precision of an index fund.  Its existence is a concession to the divergent needs of the market, a union of form and function that yields the benefits of diversification and the freedom to wield it like a single, sharp instrument.  The siren song of low expense ratios beckons, a promise of thrift and prudence, while the whispered warning of commissions stirs, a reminder that even the most judicious of investors must pay the piper.\n\nBut make no mistake, the allure of ETFs is not without its costs.  For in the bleak landscape of finance, where the wolves of risk howl with equal ferocity, the ETF IHF stands as a sentinel, its top ten holdings a concentrated essence of the entire basket.  We shall examine these holdings, these stalwarts of the ETF's portfolio, and subject them to the pitiless scrutiny of reason.  Are they truly representative of the entire entity, or do they mask the feeble heartbeat of a few, frail stocks?  We shall determine if the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nTo avoid the crushing weight of an unwieldy examination, we have distilled the ETF's holdings to its top ten, those comprising a mere 63.58% of its total assets.  Yet, in these few, we find the essence of the whole.  Below, we present the top ten holdings, their proportions of the ETF's assets a cold, unforgiving truth.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks to the ETF IHF, we shall subject them to the unforgiving calculus of Beta and Return.  The normalized percentages, a stark and unyielding truth, reveal a startling reality: a portfolio comprising only these ten holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns that hovers like a raven on the edge of the abyss.  And the Beta, that measure of risk, is a mere 0.12 lower, a whisper of hope in a desolate landscape.\n\nYet, the siren song of statistical significance beckons, a warning that these findings may be naught but the product of chance.  We must subject the standard deviation of each stock to the pitiless scrutiny of reason, normalizing their proportions to reveal the accumulated standard deviation of the ten.  Only then can we determine if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different, or if they merely whisper to each other in the darkness of chance.",
            "The shadows of dreamland, a canvas upon which Edgar Allan Poe daubed his darkest hues. In this sombre tapestry, the name \"Thulé\" reappears like a specter, its source meandering through the labyrinthine corridors of Virgil's ancient verses. But one must not be swayed by the whispers of the past, for the true provenance of this term lies in the fertile soil of Goethe's creative mind. Poe, that devourer of German literature, would have been well acquainted with the master's works, his words seeping into the marrow of the American poet like a slow-moving fever.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's meticulous tomes reveals the unsettling similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", a doppelganger of creative endeavour that belies the notion of coincidence. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of the inscrutable \"Faust\", that towering monolith of poetic drama, its second part a maelstrom of sorrow and loss. Within its pages, a cursory glance reveals the tragic tale of the King of Thulé, a monarch consumed by the very abyss of grief, his love for his departed queen a burning pyre that reduces all to ashes.\n\nThe lines blur and blend, like the ebbing tide, as we find ourselves in the haunted landscape of \"Dream-Land\", Poe's sorrowful wanderer lost in a world devoid of colour, a world echoing the desolate whispers of Goethe's own \"King of Thulé\". The parallels are striking, a shadowy doppelganger of loss and longing, a testament to the transatlantic currents that flowed between these two masters of the dark arts. The echoes of Goethe's verse, like the faint whispers of the wind, seep into the very fabric of Poe's work, a subtle yet unmistakable signature that speaks to the debts of literary kinship.\n\nIn the twilight world of literary endeavour, the connections are many and multifaceted, a complex web of influence and admiration that binds these two titans together. Poe's reverence for Tennyson, a bridge that spans the Atlantic, assures us of his familiarity with the German master's works. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of a literary unconscious, a realm where the boundaries of time and space are blurred, and the spirits of the past converge to form a tapestry of shared endeavour.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of California's jurisprudence, a question lingers: can a customer, mangled by the cruel fate of slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store's aisles, lay claim to punitive damages? The store manager's callous indifference to the danger that lay at his feet, a danger he had been warned of twice, yet allowed to linger for nigh on thirty minutes while he indulged in a solitary repast, serves as the crux of the inquiry.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. For a plaintiff to prevail in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were born of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was indeed despicable. Palmer will argue that Martin, the store manager, ought to have known the perils of leaving the spill unattended, given the litany of similar incidents that had befallen his customers in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, he chose to ignore the danger, a decision born of a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nThe argument that Martin's actions were despicable, though less persuasive, remains a tenable one, given the stark reality of six slip-and-fall incidents in the year 2009, each one a testament to the manager's failure to prioritize the safety of his store. On that fateful day, October 13th, 2009, at the stroke of five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, apprised his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin's response was a studied indifference, a flippant dismissal of the customer's plight. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous disregard. And it was at this juncture, at 5:30 pm, that Jennifer Palmer, a hapless customer, slipped and fell, her back shattered by the cruel fate that had been ordained.\n\nPrior to Palmer's calamity, five similar incidents had befallen D&D's customers, a litany of slip-and-fall incidents that spoke to the store's woeful neglect of its patrons' safety. Now, Palmer sues D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and the question lingers: will the court grant her a hearing for punitive damages, or will the defendant's callous indifference be summarily dismissed?\n\nIn California's code, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant's conduct was marked by oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights, when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions, and deliberately chose to ignore them.",
            "It has been nigh on four years since I beheld the teachings of Islam within the hallowed halls of CBC. The discourse that swirled about the faith was a maelstrom of polemics, with some pronouncing it a creed of hostility, while others extolled its virtues. The question, it seemed, remained as pertinent as ever, its relevance kindled anew by the conflagrations of 9/11. The media, once a crucible of scorn, had transformed into a vessel of unbridled tolerance, and I dared not hazard a guess as to whether this metamorphosis was a product of the times or a deliberate design.\n\nAs I pored over the biography of the Prophet, I found myself enthralled by the dichotomy between the man and the myth. My understanding of Muhammad's life had been premised on the notion that he was a warrior, a conqueror who compelled the faithful to submit. Yet, the biography presented a figure of quiet humility, a man beset by adversity and misunderstanding, who sought not to dominate but to persuade. The tale of his triumph, it seemed, was one of gentle persuasion, as one by one, the people of the desert came to recognize the truth in his teachings.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad were striking, and I could not help but be struck by the similarities between their miracles. The tale of the mutton and milk, wherein the Prophet multiplied the meager provisions to satiate the hunger of forty men, was a testament to the power of faith. And yet, I could not shake the feeling that the authors' intent was to present Muhammad as a figure of quiet authority, a man whose very presence was a testament to the truth he espoused. This, to me, was a perversion, a theft of the very essence of Jesus' message.\n\nThe stories that populated the biography seemed to follow a pattern, a litany of witness and testimony, designed to illustrate the authenticity of the Prophet's words. Yet, the very fact that these stories were often third-hand, filtered through the prism of a countless number of narrators, only served to erode their credibility. It was as if the authors sought to create a sense of communal validation, a chorus of voices that echoed the Prophet's message, rather than allowing the truth to speak for itself.\n\nIt was this very attempt to exalt Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – a man of unimpeachable character, humble and wise and gentle – that struck me as the most egregious error. For history, it seemed, painted a far different picture, a portrait of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power. And I could not help but wonder, do those who follow the Prophet today truly grasp the complexities of his rise to power, or do they see only the myth, the sanitized version of a man who has been reduced to a mere icon?",
            "The fading embers of Jesus' teachings, the faint whispers of his words, were soon lost in the maelstrom of Christian thought that churned forward like a dark and unforgiving sea.  As we scan the jagged horizon of history, a trend emerges - Christianity straying further and further from its origin, like a river that has lost its course.  The world today is ablaze with an awareness, a hunger for something more, a progressive yearning that cannot be ignored.  But the traditionalists cling to the familiar, their minds fixed on the dogma that has been drilled into their souls, resistant to any notion that dares to challenge the status quo.  Yet, even they cannot stem the tide of change.  For in the depths of Christian history, a stirring is taking place.  A growing awareness of the vast chasm between the doctrine that has been layered upon the faith and the fundamental intent of its namesake.  It is a reckoning that will not be stilled.  Decades, centuries may pass, but the outcome is inescapable - a great reversal, a turning back of the clock, a stripping away of the accretions that have accumulated like the detritus of a forgotten civilization.  The layers will be shed, one by one, until only the raw, unadulterated essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this reckoning sweeps through the land, the United States and Europe will be transformed, their populations drawn back to the wellsprings of the faith, worshipping as if the ages had rolled back, following only the path that Jesus laid out.  The church, a bastion of tradition, will remain, but its role will be to guide the faithful back to the wellspring of the faith, not to impose its will.  And as the tide of change washes over the world, the diversity that has long characterized Christendom will give way to an increasing uniformity, a return to the simplicity and unity that marked the early days of the faith.  It is a phenomenon that has played out before - the persecuted Christians of old, the Roman Empire that once shunned them, now a bastion of Christianity; our own nation, born of slavery, now led by the descendants of those once subjugated.  And so it will be with the great reversion that is to come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a rediscovery of the true essence of the faith.  This reckoning will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as the literal pronouncements of a divine being, but as the metaphorical teachings of a wise and compassionate soul.  And so we are left to ponder - what has been done to the faith since the lifetime of Jesus?\n\nLooking far back into the mists of time, we find only Judaism, the primordial spark that ignited the flame of Christianity.  A faith born of monotheism, of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people were already rent asunder by internal divisions - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common folk, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The outlines of a faith that would one day become the foundation of Christianity were already discernible, like the first tentative sketches of a work of art.  But the true form, the essence of the faith, remained elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned to those who would follow.",
            "The great and festering rot of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a paean to the abyss that lies at the heart of our species. Here, in the desolate landscape of Packingtown, the grotesque manifestations of our baser impulses writhe and twist like some noxious, living thing. The factory owners and managers, those gatekeepers of industrial progress, care not a whit for the ravages they inflict upon the earth or the suffering they bring upon those who toil beneath their heel. Theirs is a vision of unrelenting exploitation, a calculus of greed that reduces all else to mere abstraction. The factory itself, a behemoth of black steel and smoke, belches forth a noxious plume that hangs like a pall over the city, a grim testament to the cost of their avarice.\n\nAs Sinclair's words conjure the image of those towers, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" we are reminded of the indifference that lies at the heart of their endeavor. The smoke that billows forth, a great river of noxious fumes, is a constant reminder of the damage wrought by their heedless pursuit of profit. And the pens, those abattoirs of animal suffering, churn out their unholy cargo, a tide of feces and urine that stains the earth and poisons the air. All this, and yet the owners and managers care not a whit, their gaze fixed solely upon the bottom line.\n\nTheir employees, those wretched toilers, are nothing more than cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and dispensable. They toil for long hours, their bodies worn down by the ceaseless rhythms of the factory, their spirits broken by the pitiless logic of the ledger. And when their usefulness is spent, they are cast aside like so much rubbish, discarded without thought or remorse. The era in which The Jungle was written was a dark one, a time when the protection of the worker was little more than a distant dream. The laws that governed the workplace were feeble and toothless, and the owners and managers ran wild, their power unchecked.\n\nThe unions, those supposed champions of the working class, proved to be little better, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in lifting the burdens of their brethren. And so the workers, those wretched souls, were trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, their existence a mere fiction, a flickering candle in the void. They were slaves, Sinclair writes, their lives bound to the whims of their masters, their very existence a mere chance occurrence, a fragile thread in the great tapestry of industrial progress.",
            "The litany of authors in their quest to inscribe meaning upon the barren landscape of the reader's soul. Some employ devices, others artifices, to evoke a particular mood, a certain temperament, in the face of the profound. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his sprawling tapestry of a novel, The Great Gatsby, wields such devices with a deft hand. He pairs adjectives with nouns in a manner both jarring and alluring, conjuring an aura about the subject that lingers long after the words have faded from memory. The pairing of disparate terms, a florid adjective with a mundane noun, serves to underscore the artificiality of the world he seeks to reveal.\n\nFitzgerald's inventiveness is perhaps most evident in his deployment of color. He takes the mundane, the pedestrian, and imbues it with meaning, only to later subvert that meaning with a cruel twist of fate. The dichotomy of white and gray, that most pedestrian of duos, serves as the focal point of his endeavor. He bestows upon them a significance that is at once both fleeting and profound. White, a color of purity, of innocence, of the upper echelons of society; gray, a color of decay, of age, of the ravages of time.\n\nThe novel's opening pages are replete with examples of this dichotomy. The characters, a veritable parade of WASPs, are clad in their finest white finery, their very presence a testament to the shallowness of their existence. Daisy and Jordan, those paragons of virtue, are forever \"in white\" – a state of being that is at once both aspirational and suffocating. The landscape itself is not immune to this phenomenon, with the city's \"white chasms\" serving as a stark reminder of the gulf between the haves and have-nots. Even the most mundane of subjects are not immune to this treatment, with the city's \"gray names\" and \"gray land\" serving as a constant reminder of the crushing banality of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it is here that Fitzgerald's true genius lies. He takes the reader on a journey, a journey that begins with the creation of meaning and ends with its subversion. The characters, once clad in their finery, are reduced to a mere uniform, a symbol of the emptiness that lies at the heart of their existence. Daisy, once a symbol of beauty and innocence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a thing to be longed for, but ultimately unattainable. The white dresses, the gray haze of her fur collar, all serve as a reminder of the artificiality of her existence, a existence that is at once both captivating and suffocating.\n\nIn the end, it is this dichotomy that serves as the true heart of The Great Gatsby. A world of black and white, of good and evil, of moral certitude, is reduced to a world of gray, of ambiguity, of moral complexity. It is a world that is both beautiful and terrifying, a world that is at once both familiar and strange. And it is here, in this world, that Fitzgerald's true masterpiece is born.",
            "The sun-baked landscape of San Diego County, a land of unyielding fertility, is a testament to the capricious whims of nature. The mild, golden light that casts its benevolent glow upon the land has proven a balm to the crops that thrive here - the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant, succulent leaves of the citrus groves, the emerald broccoli and squash that burst forth from the earth like verdant sentinels, and the delicate, fragrant herbs that dance in the breeze like disembodied spirits. Peaches and lemons, too, ripen upon the trees, their sweetness wafting on the wind like a siren's call. Berries ripen in the underbrush, a secret feast for the birds and beasts that roam this land. And honey, that golden nectar, drips from the hives like the very essence of the sun itself. Peppers, fiery and hot, add a final, piquant note to this symphony of abundance.\n\nBut the market for this bounty is not without its own peculiar rhythms. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture has created a niche, a narrow band of profitability that is fiercely contested by those who would seek to exploit it. The waiting lists for these programs are long, a testament to the unyielding passion of those who would seek to eat from the earth with clean hands. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, the rewards are great indeed - the chance to reap the benefits of government programs, to enhance the very habitat that has given rise to this bounty, and to create a place where the landowner may walk among the crops, a steward of the earth, a guardian of the wild.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not an easy one. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water has given rise to a universe of pests and weeds, a never-ending struggle to maintain the delicate balance of this ecosystem. The labor is intense, a daily battle to outwit the forces of nature, to coax forth the bounty from the reluctant earth. Losses are greater, the margins tighter, the margins of profit razor-thin. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, there is a deeper reward - the knowledge that they are not merely farmers, but guardians of the wild, stewards of the land, and participants in a grand, unfolding drama that has been playing out upon this earth for untold centuries.\n\nThe land itself is a testament to this history - a parcel of 160 acres, a patchwork of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, a testament to the fragility of the natural world, lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of them endangered, others on the brink of extinction. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher - all are threatened, all are struggling to survive in a world that seems determined to erase them from the face of the earth.\n\nThis land has been a place of human habitation for untold centuries - a place of Native American ritual and ceremony, a place of settlement and struggle for the early European-Americans who came to this land seeking a new beginning. The original homestead patent that once called this land its own has long since been extinguished, but the memory of those who came before remains, a lingering presence that haunts the land, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.\n\nI chose this land from a real estate website, a randomly selected plot of earth that seemed to embody the contradictions of this place - a place of fertility and desolation, of abundance and scarcity, of life and death. And I researched the government programs that might assist a small farmer in this endeavor, programs that would allow me to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife, and to till this land with a clear conscience. And I found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be possible, a testament to the power of human endeavor in the face of adversity.",
            "The land of negotiations stretches out before us, a vast and unforgiving expanse where the humblest of travelers is forced to navigate the treacherous waters of differing cultures. Culture, that great and mysterious force, weaves its way through the threads of our being, a tapestry of what we are and what we are not. It is in the shadows, in the silences, that we find its true face - not in the bold proclamations of what it is, but in the subtle nuances of what it is not. To say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to invite the winds of folly to sweep in, to reduce the rich complexity of a people to a paltry caricature. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities that we find the first glimmer of insight, a spark that sets the tinder of comprehension ablaze.\n\nTo walk into the heart of a foreign culture is to venture into the unknown, where the familiar echoes of our own rhythms and cadences threaten to drown out the strange and unfamiliar sounds that surround us. It is here that we must learn to listen, to attune ourselves to the cadence of the other, lest we be deaf to the whispers of the culture itself. Study its history, its prejudices, its very essence - for it is in this understanding that we may find the key to unlocking the door to a successful negotiation.\n\nBut to attempt to change, to impose our will upon this foreign land, is to invite the darkness of misunderstanding to take hold. No, it is better to respect the boundaries, to acknowledge the traditions and beliefs that shape the landscape of the other's world. For in this respect lies the power to navigate the shoals of cultural difference, to chart a course that avoids the rocks of miscommunication and finds the safe harbor of understanding.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular and unyielding force that stretches across the face of the earth. No, it is a many-faceted gem, its facets glinting in the light of our own biases and assumptions. Within the boundaries of a nation, within the corridors of a corporation, lies a world of diversity, a tapestry woven from the threads of individuality and community. A company's culture may speak in the language of long hours and dedication, or in the relaxed cadence of a more leisurely pace. The dress code, the style of communication, the very way duties are delegated - all these and more speak to the unique character of the culture that resides within.\n\nBut it is the values that lie at the heart of this culture, the hidden springs that drive its rhythms and cadences. For it is in the values that we find the why, the underlying motivations that shape the actions of the other. If saving face is a value that is cherished, then the negotiator must tread carefully, lest he stumble into the minefield of cultural faux pas. And if communal harmony is the guiding principle, then the art of compromise becomes a delicate dance, a ballet of give and take that requires a deep understanding of the other's position.\n\nTo be a successful negotiator, then, is to be a student of the human condition, to listen with the ears of the heart and the eyes of the soul. It is to seek to understand the other, to peel back the layers of culture and reveal the person beneath. For it is in this understanding that we find the key to unlocking the door to successful negotiation, to charting a course that navigates the treacherous waters of cultural difference and finds the safe harbor of mutual understanding.",
            "In the depths of the soul, a truth lies buried, a conviction that the fool hath said in his heart: \"There is no God.\" This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two stalwart defenders of the faith: St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. The task at hand is to unravel the threads of their reasoning, to determine which of these two sages has woven the more convincing tapestry. To do so, we must embark on a journey of assumption, presuming that both Anselm and Aquinas speak of the God of the Bible, for to diverge from this path would lead us down a labyrinth of irrelevance.\n\nIn the silence of the inner sanctum, Anselm's voice whispers of a truth that resides within. His argument unfolds like a dark and winding road, a path that winds through the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, seeking the proof of God within the recesses of one's own soul. He posits that the very existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that we cannot conceive of a world without Him. The contours of this idea are shrouded in the mists of ambiguity, but its essence is clear: the proof of God lies within the depths of our own consciousness, a truth that requires no external validation. This is the essence of faith, a leap of conviction that transcends the need for empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas strides forth, a beacon of reason in a world shrouded in darkness. He declares that the existence of God is not a mystery to be solved by faith, but a truth to be uncovered through the cold light of reason. His arguments, five in number, are like the stones of a ancient structure, each one a testament to the logical necessity of God's existence. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony: these are the pillars upon which Aquinas builds his case, a case that is not based on the whispers of the soul, but on the certainties of the mind. If a puzzle lies before us, incomplete and silent, logic dictates that we can infer the presence of the missing piece, without ever having seen it.",
            "In the withered crucible of ancient time, a prince was born, one who would one day bear the weight of the name Buddha. His existence was a journey through the desolate expanse of the world, a path that ultimately led him to renounce the fetid grasp of the world and find solace in the desolate stillness of enlightenment. His teachings, like a river coursing through the parched earth, gave rise to a vast and sprawling edifice, Buddhism, with its many sects and traditions, each a twisted and gnarled branch on the twisted tree of its ancient roots. And of these, the most austere and rigid of all was Theravada, a nation born of the fierce and unyielding will of its adherents.\n\nAs the centuries ground on, like the slow and relentless march of a sandstorm, the face of the religion shifted and contorted, its features indistinct and worn by the ceaseless forces of time. In the parched and sun-scorched land of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony unfolded like a ritual macabre, a grim reminder of the impermanence that lay at the heart of all things. Monks and laymen alike participated in this somber rite, their faces lit by the faint and flickering light of a distant torch, their souls bound by the unyielding threads of tradition.\n\nBut the Theravada Buddhist community, like a living, breathing entity, had undergone transformations, its doctrine twisted and shaped by the unseen and unnamable forces that had buffeted it over the centuries. These forces, both internal and external, had left their mark, their influence like the faint and ghostly impressions on the surface of a still pond. The internal forces, born of the very marrow of the Buddhist community, had shaped the religion in ways both subtle and profound. The external forces, the hostile and the benign, had, like a slow and patient tide, worn away at its foundations, reshaping its contours and twisting its limbs.\n\nAs we delve into the core of this discussion, we find ourselves in a labyrinth of definitions, a byzantine maze of terms and concepts. The internal and external, the hostile and the benign, these qualifying terms will thread their way through our exploration like a litany, a haunting refrain that speaks to the very heart of the Theravada Buddhist experience.\n\nWe begin with the foundations, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the religion stands. The three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, shine like a triad of cold and unforgiving stars, guiding the faithful through the darkness of the world. The Dhamma, that vast and sprawling corpus of scripture, the Tripitaka, contains within it the three baskets of Buddhist teachings: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, those brief and evocative flashes of insight that speak to the nature of the world. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the disciplinary rules, a codex of conduct that guides the monk and the layman alike through the treacherous waters of the world. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most recondite and abstruse of texts, holds within it the metaphysical secrets of the universe.\n\nThe metaphysical notions that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism are as stark and unforgiving as the desert landscape itself. Anatta, the concept of no soul, like a cold wind that howls through the canyons, speaks to the transience and impermanence of all things. Dukkha, that crushing weight of inherent suffering, hangs over the world like a specter, a reminder of the futility and despair that lies at the heart of all existence. And Anicca, that most insistent and unyielding of truths, speaks to the fleeting nature of all things, a truth that lies at the very heart of the cycle of death and rebirth, that ceaseless and eternal wheel that turns through the ages.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for life are laid out, a code of conduct that guides the monk and the layman through the treacherous waters of the world. For the layman, there are the five precepts, a litany of restraint that speaks to the fundamental nature of the human condition. For the monk, the rules are more intricate and complex, a web of obligations and responsibilities that guide him through the dark and unforgiving landscape of the world.\n\nAt the very heart of Buddhism, like a burning and unyielding flame, lies the concept of the four noble truths. The first truth, Dukkha, speaks to the inherent suffering that lies at the heart of all existence. The second truth, that attachment causes suffering, like a slow and patient tide, wears away at the foundations of the world. The third truth, that suffering can be overcome, shines like a beacon of hope in the darkness, a reminder that even in the most desolate and barren of landscapes, there lies a glimmer of redemption.",
            "The dual nations of the United States and Mexico stood entwined in an unyielding web of rivalry for a span of 57 years, their animosity burning bright from 1836 to 1893, a period fraught with bloodshed and bitter recrimination. The high watermark of this unrelenting enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a conflict whose brutal ferocity would leave an indelible stain on the landscape of history. The United States, driven by an insatiable hunger for expansion, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and desolation.\n\nThe discord between these two nations was sown in the fertile soil of competing interests, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and traditions that had been incubating for generations. The chasm between them yawned wide, a chasm born of the incompatibility of their worldviews, a chasm that would prove as unbridgeable as the Rio Grande itself. It was a rift that would bleed into the very fabric of their relations, a festering wound that would refuse to heal.\n\nThe historical precedent of their animosity is a familiar one, a recurring refrain that echoes through the annals of time. Nations that share a common border, nations that are joined at the hip, are often doomed to a cycle of conflict and recrimination. The United States and Mexico were no exception, their rivalry a microcosm of the larger struggle that would play out across the continent. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). And it is here, in the shared borderlands of the Americas, that the tensions between these two nations would simmer and boil, a cauldron of competing interests and irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe specter of religious discord haunted the fringes of their relations, a ghostly presence that would refuse to be exorcised. As Sally Frahm noted, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was a divide that would prove as impassable as the deserts of the American Southwest, a chasm that would yawn wide between the two nations.\n\nTheir enmity was a legacy of the animosity that had simmered between their colonial forebears, the English and the Spanish. The distrust that had been sown in those ancient fields would germinate and grow, casting a long shadow across the centuries. It was a burden that would weigh heavily on the relations between the United States and Mexico, a weight that would only be lifted as the tides of history shifted and the passions of the rival nations began to subside.\n\nThe chronicles of their rivalry are a litany of disputes and bloodshed, a tally of 17 incidents that would scar the relations between these two nations for generations to come. Territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier violence would plague their relations, a constant reminder of the simmering tensions that had come to define their relationship. It was a cycle of violence that would only be broken when the United States and Mexico finally came to recognize the futility of their animosity, when the flames of their rivalry were doused by the cool waters of pragmatism and mutual self-interest.\n\nAs Schmitt so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109), a shift in the balance of power that would signal the beginning of the end of their animosity. And as the United States's ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rival nations began to find common ground, their relations slowly healing from the wounds of the past.",
            "The weight of it settled upon me like a shroud, fifteen years ago, a darkness that crept in without warning, an illness that had lain in wait, its presence unknown to me until it had claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, then, a profession born of necessity, a shield against the uncertainties of my own childhood. The mantra echoed in my mind, a refrain I had heard since adolescence: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of healing, a way to temper the vulnerabilities of my past. Yet, it was not the path of my dreams, for I had once aspired to be a scientist, to unravel the mysteries of the world, or a journalist, to chronicle its stories.\n\nNow, at the age of forty-six, I found myself alone, my bank account barren, my body broken. The Social Security Disability checks that sustained me were a meager lifeline, a reminder of the fragility of existence. Fifteen years had passed, and I had nothing left that was truly mine. Each day was a struggle, an assault on my very being, a constant reminder that security, safety, and self-worth were fleeting concepts. Yet, amidst this desolation, I knew one thing to be true: I would not have endured without the kindness of family and friends, their unwavering support a testament to the power of human connection.\n\nIn the face of disaster, we are not as strong as we believe. It is in these moments of calamity that we discover the truth of our own vulnerability. And it is here that I find solace in the idea that we should not rely solely on the benevolence of a crumbling system, but rather on each other. The notion of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of some, is a myth, a palliative for the ailing souls of those who would have us believe that we can weather any storm alone.\n\nOur forebears, those pioneers who traversed the treacherous terrain of the Rockies, did not reach the promised land through solitary endeavors, but through the sharing of resources, the bond of community, and the compassion that fostered it. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the collective.\n\nI, too, have prepared for the worst. I have stockpiled supplies, a meager arsenal against the unknown: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and the faint glimmer of hope that these will be enough. But I know that it is not the accumulation of goods that will see me through, but the threads of connection that bind me to those around me. If you have the means, cultivate a small farm, preserve your own food, and tend a wood stove. But do not forget the most essential ingredient in the recipe for resilience: the knowledge of your neighbors.",
            "In the grand tapestry of life, the thread of evolution weaves its intricate pattern, a testament to the unfathomable complexity of the natural world. The question lingers, a specter haunting the halls of biology, why do organisms unfold as they do? What unseen forces shape the trajectory of their development, guiding the course of their transformation? Since the dawn of modern science, the enigmatic D'Arcy Thompson posited that the zoologist's grasp of organic forms remains as elusive as a mirage on a desert horizon, tantalizing yet forever out of reach. Even now, a century later, the same sentiment holds sway.\n\nThe application of mathematical rigor to the study of mollusk skeletogenesis has, however, yielded glimmers of understanding. Raup and Stanley's pioneering work in 1981 illuminated the path forward, a beacon in the darkness of the unknown. Our investigation seeks to illuminate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, a journey that wends its way through the labyrinthine corridors of ontogeny and phylogeny. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental inquiry, we aim to decipher the secrets of morphological transformation.\n\nX-radiographic images of Prunum species serve as the canvas upon which our investigation is painted. The skeletal parameters distilled from these images are then inscribed upon the tablets of our software program, CerioShell, a tool akin to a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mollusk's form. We have crafted hypothetical shell morphologies, a series of possible trajectories that might have been, and thus shed light upon the boundaries of morphological possibility in Prunum. These findings are to be conjoined with experimental and descriptive studies, a union of disparate threads that shall weave a richer tapestry of understanding.\n\nA shell, that most enigmatic of structures, presents itself as a tube traversing the expanse of time and space, its revolutions – the whorls – a spiral around an axis, the columella, an unseen and eternal core. The speed at which these whorls unfold varies, a tempo that governs the cadence of growth. The sutures, those slender lines separating each whorl, stand as sentinels marking the passage of time. The body whorl, the last and largest of these spirals, holds the apex, the highest point of the shell, while the spire, a tapering column, stretches towards the base, the opposite extremity. The aperture, a gateway to the world, serves as the mollusk's entrance and exit, a portal to the realm of the unknown.\n\nA shell can be contemplated from four disparate perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a unique window onto the mystery of its form. The apertural view, with the opening oriented towards the observer, is the most common, a vantage point that invites the eye to behold the shell in all its glory.\n\nThe whorls, those spiraling coils, can be counted by tracing the first suture, a starting point that marks the initiation of growth. A line drawn from this point divides the shell, and the whorls are enumerated, each one estimated to a quarter turn. This method, a technique akin to charting the constellations on a celestial map, allows us to quantify the passage of time and the unfolding of the shell.\n\nAs the mollusk grows, its shell becomes a series of apertures, each one a portal to a new moment in time, a new space traversed by the animal's steady accretion. The trajectory of these apertures can be plotted, a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This formulation, a language of numbers and symbols, allows us to manipulate the parameters, to vary the tempo and rhythm of the shell's development.\n\nIn this manner, we may peer into the very fabric of life, and behold the hidden patterns that govern the unfolding of form and function. The trajectory of the aperture, a thread of continuity, weaves its way through the tapestry of time, a testament to the intricate and beautiful mystery of evolution.",
            "In the marrow of Indonesia's progress, a frigid chill has set in, its icy fingers grasping for the fragile lives of the young. The neonatal and infant mortality rates, once a stubborn bastion of resistance, have remained static for a full decade, defying the ambitions of a nation striving to reclaim its place among the ranks of the living. The targets of the Millennium Development Goals, once within grasp, now recede like a mirage on a desert horizon. The water and sanitation targets, like a parched traveler, have been quenched, but the waters of child and maternal health remain stagnant, their shores a barren wasteland of unfulfilled promise.\n\nThe statistics, a cold and unforgiving mistress, reveal a tale of partial victories and lingering despair. Seventy-two percent of births now bear witness to the presence of a skilled health worker, but this dubious triumph masks a deeper truth: the midwives, those tentative guardians of life, are often powerless to stem the tide of complications that wash over their charges. The maternal deaths, a grim testament to this failure, stand as a stark reminder that even the most laudable progress can be a thin veneer, a brittle crust that shatters beneath the weight of reality.\n\nIn the rural expanse of Indonesia, the cesarian-section rates hover at an anemic 2%, a stark contrast to the 7% that marks the urban landscape. This chasm, a gulf of inequality, yawns wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that afflict the nation. The poor, like a shipwrecked castaway, are left to fend for themselves, their access to healthcare services a distant memory, a fleeting dream that vanishes on the winds of poverty.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the abyss of neonatal and maternal care, the question hangs in the balance, a choice between two paths: the one that beckons with programmatic solutions, a siren's call that promises swift results and targeted objectives, but also tempts with the dangers of duplication and fragmentation; or the path that seeks to strengthen the health system, a more arduous journey that may yield slower returns, but one that holds the promise of sustainability and equity.\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, like a tantalizing mirage, draws the eye, promising a quick fix, a magic bullet that solves the problem in a single, well-targeted strike. But the costs, like the weight of the desert sands, are crushing: the diversion of resources, the hemorrhaging of human capital, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that drown out the cries of the suffering. The danger, like a specter, haunts the fringes of this approach, a ghostly presence that whispers of a future where the poor are left to fend for themselves, their health a distant memory, a luxury reserved for the privileged few.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiar subgenre emerged, characterized by an unyielding attention to detail and an affinity for the aristocracy of the era. Two novels that diverged from this tradition, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, instead opted for an unorthodox narrative path, replete with mystery and an air of the bizarre. This deliberate departure from the expected served to imbue their characters with a depth and complexity that would otherwise have remained elusive.\n\nThe words of Charles Dickens echo through the shadows, a haunting refrain that speaks to the fractured mind of his protagonist: \"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind, like specters from a dark and forsaken place. He seemed to still walk among Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices ringing in his ears, their words an endless litany that threatened to consume him whole. And then, like a mirage on a dusty plain, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and he felt himself being borne away by some unseen hand, his senses reeling in a maelstrom of pain and confusion.\"\n\nIn these novels, the mysteries unfold like a slow-burning fire, often through the lens of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences serve as a window into the depths of Oliver's soul, revealing the dark fears and pains that lurked within. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, becomes a recurring nightmare, a vivid and all-consuming memory that threatens to consume him whole. As he relives the event, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and we are left with the haunting question: who is responsible for his misfortune, and why? The answer, much like the shooting itself, remains shrouded in an impenetrable haze, leaving only the faintest whisper of despair and hopelessness.\n\nThe darkness closes in, a suffocating shroud that threatens to extinguish the last vestiges of light. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" The words of Dickens hang in the air, a mournful dirge that speaks to the futility of human endeavor in the face of an uncaring universe.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, this sense of powerlessness is palpable, a crushing weight that threatens to break the spirit. The shooting serves as a stark reminder that Oliver is not the master of his own destiny, that the forces arrayed against him are too strong, too insidious to be defeated. And yet, even in the face of this overwhelming despair, there remains a glimmer of hope, a flickering candle that casts a faint light into the darkness.",
            "It was a dusty afternoon, the kind that seems to cling to the soul like a shroud. I had been working at the after-school program for what felt like an eternity, my days a blur of makeshift lesson plans and weary gazes from the elementary-age students who wandered in each day with their own particular brand of desperation. I had a particular fondness for the written word, and so I found myself drawn to the young boy they called Adrian. He was a small thing, no more than eight years old, with eyes that seemed to hold a depth of sorrow I had seen in few others. They told me he struggled with reading, but I soon discovered that it wasn't quite so simple. Some letters he knew, their shapes and sounds etched into his mind like the lines on a well-worn book. Others, however, left him stumbling, his tongue tangled in knots as he sought to pronounce the alien sounds. It was as if the very language itself had betrayed him, a thief in the night that had stolen his understanding.\n\nWe worked together for what felt like an eternity, I and this small, bruised boy. But it wasn't until his mother appeared, a woman with a face like worn leather and eyes that seemed to hold a world of pain, that the truth began to reveal itself to me. She spoke no English, only the soft, melodic language of her people. Our communication was a halting, broken thing, like the staccato beat of a drum on a cold winter's night. And yet, in that moment, something clicked into place. Adrian's struggles, his stumblings, were not the result of some inherent deficiency, but rather a simple matter of unfamiliarity. The English alphabet, once a mystery to him, began to reveal its secrets, and I was left with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of language.\n\nI tell this story, a cautionary tale of the language barrier that separates us, to illustrate the profound obstacles that stand between us and understanding. It is a chasm that yawns wide, a seemingly insurmountable gulf that divides the haves from the have-nots. But I also tell it to suggest that this problem is not always so evident, even to ourselves. We think we know, we think we understand, but the truth is often shrouded in shadows, waiting to be uncovered. In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: one-on-one tutoring, an attentive ear and a gentle hand to guide him through the labyrinth of language. But for the countless others, the answer is far more complicated.\n\nThe dual language system, so touted as a panacea for the language-challenged, is but a single thread in the tapestry of solutions. It is a fragile, tenuous thing, a thread that may snap under the weight of expectation. And yet, it holds within it the seeds of hope. For in its gentle, patient approach, we find the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers, to flourish in a world that often seems determined to stifle them. But we must not be fooled into thinking that this is a simple solution, a magic bullet that will somehow solve the problem overnight. It is not.\n\nWe must approach this challenge with caution, with empathy, and with a deep understanding of the complexities that lie at its heart. We must recognize that the language barrier is not something that can be bridged with a single solution, but rather a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted approach. We must have faith in the power of the human spirit, in the capacity for language to heal and to connect us, even in the darkest of times. And we must be willing to walk the long, winding road that lies before us, with all its twists and turns, its triumphs and setbacks.\n\nThis, then, is the question: how do we bridge the chasm that separates us? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual, to be linguists and diplomats and miracle workers, all at once? No, that would be an unreasonable expectation, a bridge too far. But we can, and must, provide them with the tools they need to navigate this complex landscape. We can, and must, provide them with bilingual aids, with tutors, with whatever resources they need to unlock the doors of understanding.\n\nThe solution lies not in a single answer, but in a thousand small, incremental steps. It lies in the quiet, patient work of teachers and tutors and caregivers, who toil in the trenches, day after day, to bring forth the hidden talents and abilities of their students. It lies in the recognition that language is not a static thing, a fixed entity that can be learned and mastered, but rather a dynamic, living, breathing creature that must be nurtured and coaxed into being. And it lies, finally, in our willingness to listen, to hear the language of the heart, and to respond with compassion, with understanding, and with a deep and abiding commitment to the beauty and power of the human spirit.",
            "From the earliest dawn of our existence, a whispered promise has been whispered into our ears - a cold wind that stirs the trees of our souls, beckoning us towards the unattainable. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others prowl the musty aisles of Temple, or delve into the dark recesses of their own innermost selves in search of answers. Many cling to the worn and weathered truths of their forebears, while a few reject them outright, scorning the notion that there lies something beyond the narrow confines of our individual domains. We chase the shadows, grasping for a fleeting glimpse of something greater, a light to guide us through the dark and into the desolate vastness of an uncertain future.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two worn stones, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, the droplets hammering against the tin roof above us like a dirge. We sat on the porch, the gutters overflowing, drowning the parched earth and withered plants that clung to the edge of our domain. The air reeked of smoke and damp earth. His thin frame, gaunt and worn, seemed to sag beneath the weight of his own mortality. His hair, once a wild tangle, now lay sparse and still, a testament to the ravages of time. I felt the weight of his silence, the unspoken words that hung in the air like a challenge. I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and leaned back into the creaking chair, our bodies a fragile barrier against the encroaching darkness.\n\nHe passed five days after my twenty-second birthday, in the cold grasp of December's bitter chill. The poison and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but what price had been paid for these fleeting months, I could not fathom. What kind of deity would orchestrate such a cruel symphony? I lay awake in the dead of night, my breath a whispered curse. If there was a god, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his final passage, to see the light flicker out of his eyes as the life drained from his frame. I could not watch the man who had given me life slip away, his essence dissolving into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he became. And so, I waited, curled into a fetal ball, as the hours ticked by like grains of sand in an hourglass. No one came to claim me, no soft words to ease the ache in my heart.",
            "The Gothic novel, a term freighted with the contradictions of the old and the new, strains against the boundaries of definition. It is a genre born of oxymoron, a marriage of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt so astutely observed in his account of its rise. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and dissected, its very essence subject to the whims of literary fashion. And yet, despite the capricious nature of critical opinion, the Gothic novel persists, its appeal lying in the dark, terrible beauty it evokes. Edmund Burke's notion of the \"sublime\" finds its perfect corollary in the Gothic's somber, haunted landscapes, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present.\n\nIn Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the ur-text of the Gothic novel, we find the germination of this peculiar alchemy. Walpole, a master of theatricality and mimicry, wove together the disparate threads of ancient romance and modern narrative to create a new and singular form. The \"Gothic Story,\" as he called it, was a deliberate anachronism, a pastiche of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. And yet, in its very anachronism lay its power, a power that would endure for centuries, even as the world around it underwent a radical transformation.\n\nThe Gothic novel's debt to medieval chivalry is particularly noteworthy. The ideal of the knight, with its attendant values of honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a potent symbol of a bygone era, and one that Walpole and his fellow writers saw as increasingly lost in the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this ideal is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, whose sufferings and travails serve as a commentary on the decay of chivalric values in a world gone awry. The description of Frederic is a tour-de-force of Gothic excess, a hyperbolic portrait of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that sets the tone for the entire genre.\n\nIn the midst of a society torn asunder by politics and strife, Walpole's writing becomes a cri de coeur, a lament for the loss of a bygone era of moral certitude. The Gothic novel, with its emphasis on the \"terrible sublime,\" becomes a means of negotiating the abyss between past and present, a bridge of darkness and despair that spans the chasm between two worlds. And it is in this darkness, this abyss, that we find the true power of the Gothic novel, a power that continues to haunt and fascinate us to this day.",
            "In the vast expanse of commerce, a hidden web of processes unravels, a silent dance of goods and materials from the raw, unyielding earth to the eager hands of the consumer. This opaque tapestry is the supply chain, a labyrinthine path that weaves through stages of production, supply, and distribution, each step a deliberate gesture towards the satisfaction of the customer's insatiable hunger.\n\nIt was in 1982 that Keith Oliver, a sage advisor, first coined the term supply chain management, a phrase that would come to define the intricate ballet of planning, implementation, and control that governs this secretive realm. The six sacred elements of the supply chain – production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information – are the pillars upon which this edifice stands. The managers of commerce, those masters of the obscure, utilize these elements to provide their customers with a service that is at once swift, efficient, and attentive.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this grand process, is the very foundation upon which the supply chain is built. It is here that the stage is set, the when, why, where, and how of creation determined. The market, that capricious mistress, holds the key to understanding the desires of the customer, and it is from her whispers that managers glean the knowledge necessary to chart their course. With the market's counsel in hand, they decide what to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce it, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable thirst.\n\nThe location of production, that crucial decision, is not taken lightly. Managers must weigh the pros and cons, pitting volume against quality, all the while keeping the customer's satisfaction paramount. And once the location is determined, the focus shifts to scheduling, to the careful allocation of workloads and the maintenance of equipment. Every detail, no matter how seemingly trivial, holds the power to make or break the supply chain, to reap a bounty of time and money, or to sow the seeds of ruin.\n\nI recall my own time in the retail trenches, at the hallowed halls of Wal-Mart and Target, where every step, every gesture, was choreographed with precision, from the design of the employee's uniform to the receipt of shipments. The benefits of such planning are legion: a company that moves with purpose, unencumbered by the weight of confusion and misdirection.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is supply, that vital element that governs the very fabric of the supply chain. Here, managers must make strategic decisions, weighing the costs and benefits of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A single product may require multiple divisions, each with its own unique equipment, workers, and specializations. The manager must decide which division is best suited to each process, all the while keeping the customer's needs at the forefront. And should the need arise, the manager may choose to outsource, to partner with other companies, in the pursuit of velocity – that elusive quality of providing flexibility and quality at a reduced cost.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, a splintered message scrawled across its weathered surface: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". A solitary figure stood beneath it, a young woman with a face worn by the weight of the world. Ellen Page, a fleeting name from a distant land, held aloft the makeshift placard as if it were a beacon in a desolate landscape. The words, penned in hasty scrawl, seemed to mock her from the page like a cruel jest.\n\nBurma, a land shrouded in shadow, was a nation ruled by an iron fist. A junta of ruthless men, their faces twisted by the lust for power, had seized control in a bloodless coup. The date was etched in history as 1962, a year that marked the beginning of an era of unyielding oppression. The people, their voices silenced by fear, were forced to endure the whims of their oppressors.\n\nIn 2007, a flicker of defiance flared to life. Monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope in a sea of darkness, took to the streets to protest the injustices they had suffered for so long. Their cries for freedom fell on deaf ears, however, as the military junta responded with brutal force. Monasteries were reduced to rubble, foreign journalists were imprisoned and silenced, and the streets ran red with the blood of the innocent.\n\nThe death toll, a number that would only grow with time, was a mere whisper of the true horror that had unfolded. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had once been a part of the very machine that had perpetrated these atrocities, now spoke out against it. His words, a testament to the human cost of unchecked power, were a stark reminder of the darkness that lurked within the human heart.\n\nThis was not a new tale, nor was it a unique one. The desire to crush dissent, to snuff out the flames of freedom, had been a constant companion to humanity throughout its messy, bloody history. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had ruled with an iron fist. The Japanese emperors, deified by their people, had led them down a path of self-destruction. And in our own time, the leaders of nations had spoken with the voices of gods, their words dripping with venom and deceit.\n\nFrom the Tiananmen Square massacre to the Rwandan genocide, from the Third Reich to the countless other atrocities that had scarred the face of the earth, the same dark impulse had driven men to commit unspeakable acts. And yet, even as the world mourned the dead and the living trembled with fear, the cycle continued. The desire for power, the lust for control, remained an unquenchable fire that burned at the very heart of humanity.",
            "In the desolate vastness of jazz history, Duke Ellington's legacy stands as a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor. His artistry, a testament to the futility of human endeavor, transcended the confines of time, as his orchestra, a collection of disparate individuals, coalesced into a cohesive entity under his direction. The piano, an instrument often relegated to the periphery, Ellington wielded with a subtlety that belied its importance, his nimble fingers dancing across the keys like a conductor orchestrating the very fabric of reality.\n\nAs a composer, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to craft frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl their talents like a lotus blooming in the desert. He wove intricate patterns, a tapestry of sound that showcased the unique timbre of each player, inviting them to improvise, to weave their own narratives within the fabric of his compositions. And thus, the orchestra, an ensemble of disparate voices, coalesced into a single, unified entity, a symphony of sound that echoed through the ages.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, a paean to the voice as a jazz instrument, stands as a testament to Ellington's innovative spirit. Like a vessel filled with the scent of decay, this early work, through its use of voice to add texture and color, hinted at the depths of his artistry. The deliberate, plodding pace of this twelve-bar blues, a funeral dirge for the conventions of traditional melody, gave way to six choruses, each a variation on the theme of call and response.\n\nThe first chorus, a gentle, melodic whisper, gave way to a raspy, guttural cry, a manifestation of the raw emotion that lay beneath the surface. The muted trumpet solo that followed, a mournful lament, emphasized the bluesy, extended notes that would become a hallmark of Ellington's style. The sweeping clarinet solo, a virtuosic display of agility, was counterpointed by a syncopated piano phrase, a staccato beat that underpinned the entire piece.\n\nThe full band, a riotous explosion of sound, echoed the first chorus, a call and response between brass and reeds that echoed the primal, primeval rhythms of the universe. The climactic fifth chorus, a cacophonous maelstrom of sound, saw the reeds take center stage, their call and response a high-pitched, wailing cry that pierced the heavens. And finally, the sixth chorus, a return to the gentle whisper of the first, saw the voice take on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal, animalistic cry that left the listener breathless.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a work that followed a year later, Ellington combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich, complementary sound, a marriage of voice and instrument that echoed the primordial, elemental forces that shaped the universe. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of Ellington's orchestra, took center stage, his muted trombone introducing the melody like a benediction from on high.\n\nThus, Ellington's legacy, a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor, stood as a testament to the power of art to transcend the boundaries of time and space. His music, a paean to the fleeting nature of human experience, echoed through the ages, a reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the reaches of our mortal grasp.",
            "The void within her lingered, a gnawing ache that refused to subside. It had begun to manifest in her adolescence, a whisper in the darkness, a shadow that trailed her footsteps like a persistent specter. The years had passed, and the hunger remained, a constant presence that seemed to mock her every step. She was 17 now, a threshold of adulthood looming before her, and still the void persisted. It was a hunger that had once been sated by material possessions, but now it had taken on a more insistent form: the desire for connection, for love, for the gentle warmth of another's touch. Yet, she felt an unshakeable detachment from the boys who sought to claim her, their clumsy overtures a farce, a pale imitation of the real thing.\n\nThe days blended together in a haze of quietude, her parents a steady, soothing presence in her life. They were a calm sea, untroubled by the turmoil that churned within her. Their tranquility was a balm to her soul, a reminder that she was not entirely lost. But today was not a day of peace. Her mother's cry pierced the air, a sharp, blood-curdling shriek that shook her to her core. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing, her mind a jumble of terror and confusion. Her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled, broken thing, her body twisted in an unnatural pose.\n\n\"Oh, sweet lord,\" her mother gasped, her voice a threadbare whisper. \"Help me, child.\" The daughter's hand closed around her mother's, a surge of panic coursing through her veins. \"Just get me to the hospital,\" her mother begged, her voice a desperate rasp. The daughter's mind reeled as she helped her mother to her feet, supporting her weight, her own strength faltering in the face of her mother's pain.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of fear and worry, the scent of disinfectant and sickness hanging heavy in the air. Her mother's face was a mask of agony, her eyes closed in a desperate bid to shut out the pain. The daughter's mind was a jumble of frantic thoughts, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum. What had happened? How had her mother fallen? The questions swirled in her mind like a maelstrom, but she pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctors' faces were a blur of concern and efficiency, their words a distant hum in the background as she helped her mother onto a gurney. They whisked her away, leaving the daughter alone, her mind reeling with fear and worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. It seemed a trivial thing, a careless mistake, but the daughter knew better. The consequences were all too real, the pain and the fear etched on her mother's face a stark reminder of the fragility of life.",
            "The arid landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke stretched out before us, a desolate expanse of mortality and decay. It was against this bleak backdrop that the Mediterranean Diet, a gaunt and unforgiving mistress, was tested. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a numerical gauge of adherence to this dietary regime, held the key to unraveling the mysteries of its efficacy. Higher scores, a testament to a diet rich in plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and bereft of saturated fats and animal products, beckoned the promise of a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.\n\nPrior studies, like ghostly apparitions, had whispered tales of the Med diet's inverse association with total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a fleeting, flickering flame of hope, had shown the Med diet to be a more potent ally in the struggle against weight loss and the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the specter of stroke, a dark and silent killer, remained unexamined.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses, 74,886 threads were woven into the fabric of this investigation. These women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were the subjects of a 20-year odyssey. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, the authors computed the aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a litany of nutrient intake that echoed through the years. The FFQs, a testament to the women's diligence, were validated, their truthfulness verified by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records and hospital documents.\n\nThe reports of heart disease, fatal and non-fatal, stroke, and death were confirmed, their occurrence leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of this study. In the absence of records, the presence of probable cases, a spectral presence that hung like a shadow, was acknowledged, comprising 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts. The tapestry of this study was further enriched by the inclusion of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, each thread intricately woven into the narrative.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary intake, the authors calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The resulting tapestry, a rich and complex weave, was adjusted for the confounders that threatened to obscure the truth: age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical sorcery, was employed to unravel the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. The results, a stark and unflinching portrait, revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was indeed associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The 20-year vigil, a testament to the power of this dietary regime, yielded 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile, a select and privileged few, were found to be at lower risk for both CHD and stroke, their fate sealed by a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of 2007, a tempest of fiscal despair beset the United States of America, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and desolate economic ruin. Unemployment reared its head like a specter, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the behemoths of American industry lay shattered, their grandeur reduced to naught but rubble. As we stand amidst this devastation, we are compelled to confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity unfold, and how might we avert its recurrence? The truth, like a cadaverous specter, rears its head: a concatenation of selfish and naive political machinations, which coerced banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web.\n\nFannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC), those behemoths of the financial world, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into the toxic abominations known as CDOs and CDSs. And when the borrowers defaulted, as was inevitable, the banks were left with the bitter taste of defeat, their capital reserves laid bare and their coffers drained. The chaos thus unleashed was transferred, like a plague, onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and thence to the economy at large.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the Clinton era, in the year 1999, when the President, a man driven by ambition and the lust for power, sought to cement his legacy by relaxing lending restrictions. His aim was to boost his popularity, to bask in the adoration of the masses, and to ensure his re-election. But in his zeal, he set in motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the sub-prime crisis seven long years later. A prescient Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a prophetic warning in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes foresaw the calamity that would befall the nation, and sounded the alarm: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nAs the years amassed into a gathering storm, the economy teetered on the brink of collapse, threatened by a concatenation of factors. The new and labyrinthine structure of mortgages, replete with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), ensnared the economy in its deadly coils. The U.S. households, and financial markets in general, became mired in a web of debt, over-leveraged and vulnerable to the slightest perturbation in the housing market.\n\nAnd so the housing bubble burst, releasing a maelstrom of destruction upon the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a figure that accounted for fully 30% of the USA's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, becoming commercial banks subject to the strictures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those erstwhile titans of the financial world, were left with a mountain of mortgage debt, a staggering $5 trillion, which would eventually necessitate their nationalization in September 2008.",
            "In the depths of a writer's craft, there lies a pitfall so treacherous, it can send readers tumbling into the abyss of boredom or, worse still, driving them to flee in search of more verdant pastures.  This demon is exposition, that insidious force that tempts us to unveil the secrets of our narrative, to spill the beans, so to speak, in a torrent of words that drowns the very essence of our story.  Dr. Merlin's face contorts in a mixture of frustration and dismay as she confronts the page, her eyes scanning the sea of words for a lifeline, a thread to cling to as the exposition threatens to consume her.\n\nFor in the heat of creation, it's easy to forget the sage counsel of 'show, don't tell.'  The words \"Show, don't tell,\" echo through the chambers of her mind, a reminder of the perils of succumbing to the siren's call of exposition.  But still, she finds herself lost in a quagmire of information, drowning in the details of a character's past, their history, their loves, their losses.\n\nExposition, that wily foe, whispers sweet nothings in our ear, tempting us to reveal the backstory, the history, the context.  But it's a double-edged sword, this exposition.  In film, it's the tedious speech of the Ancient Mariner, a core-dump of information that numbs the senses.  In fiction, it's the author's own telling, a voice that, if not checked, can drown out the music of the narrative.\n\nConsider this: a heroine, a beloved, a marriage, a murder.  Two pages of exposition, a paltry two lines of dialogue.  The husband's character, a cipher, a shadow, a mere whisper of his presence in the heroine's life.  But what if we were to breathe life into him?  What if we gave him voice, gave him substance?  We might see in his eyes the depth of his love for her, the way he moves with a quiet confidence, the way he speaks with a gentleness that belies the strength of his character.  We might see in the heroine the way he changed her, the way he enriched her, the way she was drawn to him like a moth to flame.\n\nAnd when he dies, we would mourn his passing, not just as a plot device, but as a loss, a tragedy, a reminder of the fragility of life.  We would feel the heroine's pain, her grief, her loss.  And in that, we would be drawn closer to her, our connection deepened by the bond we shared with her beloved.\n\nIn short, we need to add meat to the bone of the story.  We need to give it flesh, blood, breath.  We need to make the reader care.  For in the end, it's not just about the plot, it's about the people, the characters, the lives we touch, the hearts we break.  And that, that is the true art of storytelling.",
            "I watched the newscast's from Columbus, Ohio, the city's shadows cast long and dark upon the screen. The first, a fleeting glimpse of NBC 4, a broadcast that danced across the air like a moth in flame. It was the thirteenth of August, a day that would leave its mark upon the souls of all who dwelled within these city walls. The lead story, a tale of blood and steel, unfolded like a dark flower blooming in the desert. A man, Shad Hostettler, his face twisted into a visage of malevolence, had brought harm to his wife. The details, scarce as the morning dew, spoke of multiple stab wounds, a life left broken. The anchor's voice, a monotone murmur, barely above a whisper, seemed to imply that this was but a fleeting moment, a brief excursion into the abyss.\n\nThe second story, a whispered rumor of violence, spoke of a young life, Travis Buyers, his name etched into the annals of time, his fate hanging in the balance. A shooting, a brutal and senseless act, had left him critically injured, his future far from certain. The SWAT team, a phalanx of steel and determination, moved in, their presence a testament to the darkness that lurked within the city's streets. But the story, it seemed, was already fading, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanished into the ether, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of its existence.\n\nThe news continued, a relentless drumbeat of violence and despair. A gunshot hole, a blemish on the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder that even the skies were not immune to the city's brutal grasp. A .22 caliber bullet, a tiny fragment of metal, had pierced the metal beast, leaving behind a trail of uncertainty. A reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, was offered to those who would dare to speak out against the shadows.\n\nThe weather, a mere sideshow, a distraction from the main event, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms, a fleeting respite from the heat that clung to the city like a shroud. The temperatures, a mere abstraction, would remain in the mid to low eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, the natural world persisted.\n\nAnd then, a story that would leave its mark, a tale of robbery and deceit. A Clime Road UDF, a bastion of commerce, had been breached, its defenses breached by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, his presence a fleeting glimpse of something primal and unyielding. The anchor's voice, a monotone drone, seemed to linger on the details, to emphasize the darkness of his skin, as if it were a badge of shame.\n\nA final story, a testament to the city's twisted priorities, spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana, his fate a mere abstraction, a number, three hundred months, a reminder that even in the depths of the justice system, the numbers game was always played.",
            "A bond forged in blood and fire, unyielding and unbreakable. It is this bond that ties two brothers together, a tangle of emotions that cannot be unraveled - love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and all the tangled threads that bind them. In the crucible of adversity, this bond is revealed in all its brutal beauty, its true nature laid bare like the scorched earth after a wildfire. And it is here, in this most dire of circumstances, that the true cost of this bond is paid in full.\n\nTo gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, a mirrored image that reveals the depths of one's own soul. It is in the actions, the words, and the consequences of those actions that the true character of a man is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, a desperate bid to escape the crushing weight of their own despair. The landscape around them is a lush, verdant tapestry, a mere backdrop for the tragedy that unfolds.\n\nPride, that most corrosive of emotions, is the thread that weaves throughout this tale. The protagonist's heart is a battleground, a war-scarred terrain where resentment and love clash in a maelstrom of conflicting desires. He had envisioned a brother who would be a mirror image of himself, a companion in arms, a fellow traveler on the path to manhood. But fate, that cruel and capricious mistress, had other plans. Doodle, the younger brother, was a fragile thing, his heart a mere whisper of what it should be. The protagonist's dreams of a brotherly bond, of a shared adventure, were crushed beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAnd yet, even as his heart festered with resentment, a spark of love remained, a flame that flickered in the darkness. For in Doodle's smile, the protagonist saw a glimmer of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest depths of despair, there is always a glimmer of redemption. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a soul wrestling with the demons of his own making.\n\nIn the end, it is not the outcome of their journey that matters, but the journey itself, the twisted, tortured path that leads to the climactic moment of truth. And it is here, in this moment, that the true nature of the bond between brothers is revealed, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, cruel and redemptive.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human mind, a labyrinthine complexity unfolds, a tapestry of thought woven from the threads of perception. As the ages pass, the parlance of description has evolved, a litany of metaphors born from the crude and the refined. We once likened the cerebral cortex to a wax tablet, a crude slate upon which the marks of knowledge were etched. Then to a sheet of papyrus, its pockmarked surface bearing the weight of hieroglyphic knowledge. And further still, to a book, its pages dog-eared and worn from the fingers of countless readers. And now, in the virtual expanse of the modern era, to a computer, its algorithms a cold, calculating heartbeat.\n\nBut these metaphors, like the fleeting shadows on a wall, are mere approximations, their utility bound by the constraints of language. For in the depths of the brain, a primal alchemy unfolds, as sensory impressions are transmuted into electrochemical impulses. The senses, those doorkeepers of the mind, receive the raw material of the world: the gentle caress of a summer breeze, the scorching heat of a desert sun, the sonorous thrum of a guitar string, or the piercing light of a desert star. These impressions are then transformed, refined, and reassembled by the brain's own peculiar logic, a dialectic of bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nIn the former, the building blocks of perception are painstakingly assembled, a mosaic of color, shape, and texture. A black box on a white background, for instance, is recognized through the gradual accumulation of these elementary data points. And yet, it is the top-down processing that imbues this recognition with meaning, that gives the box its significance, its context. For it is through this process that we identify the box not merely as a shape, but as a container, a vessel, a thing.\n\nBut perception is a fleeting thing, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanishes at the merest whisper of distraction. And so, the brain must prioritize, filter out the irrelevant, and focus on the essential. The attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, stands guard, determining which signals are worthy of consideration, which are but fleeting shadows, to be discarded like so many autumn leaves on a winter's wind.\n\nAnd yet, even as the brain filters and prioritizes, it must also store, encode, and maintain the information it receives. There are multiple types of memory, each with its own peculiar logic, its own rhythms and cadences. Sensory memory, that fleeting whisper of the present, gives way to working memory, that brief, shining moment of recall, and long-term memory, that vast, labyrinthine repository of knowledge.\n\nThe encoding of information is a process of translation, a mapping of the raw data of the world onto the brain's own peculiar syntax. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded through its structure, its sound, or its meaning. And once encoded, this information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical impulses that fire through the neural networks, like the steady beat of a drum.\n\nBut how is this knowledge organized, this vast, unwieldy tapestry of thought? The semantic network, a model of the mind's inner workings, posits a web of interconnected nodes, each representing a concept, a meaning, a thing. \"Chair,\" for instance, is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. And so, the mind's vast, labyrinthine library is revealed, a boundless expanse of thought, where meaning and connection await the curious, the inquiring mind.",
            "In the sterile expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the dystopian trajectory of a world enthralled by the siren song of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist excess. A people conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of immediate gratification, they forsake the depths of individuality for the shallow comforts of a collective existence. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating a grand farce in which the masses are reduced to pawns, their thoughts and desires shaped to conform to the dictates of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theo-philosophy, we discern the author's implicit suspicions regarding the perils of emerging systems that spawn and sustain this bleak world. The terminology of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a litany, a testament to Huxley's prescience regarding the insidious effects of unchecked capitalism. The false consciousness, a concept dear to Marxist thought, is here wielded as a satirical tool, laying bare the ways in which the common citizenry is denied knowledge of their true relations with other classes, their gaze fixed instead on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence.\n\nThe Delta and Gamma classes, those bound to the drudgery of menial labor, are denied the gift of self-awareness, their desires honed to a razor's edge by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia. The World Controller manipulates this docility, orchestrating a grand farce in which the underclasses are bought into an ideology that serves to entrench their subjugation. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces disparate groups to a state of subjugation, is wielded with ruthless efficiency, the ruling classes aping the behavior of their overlords, their awareness of the game's true nature limited to a rarefied few, like Bernard, whose rebellion is as much a product of his own privilege as it is a genuine assertion of individuality.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, relationships between individuals are reduced to the most superficial of levels, the characters themselves little more than cardboard cutouts, devoid of depth or nuance. Love, that most fundamental of human emotions, is an anathema, replaced by the sterile, transactional interactions that pass for human connection in this dystopian world. The males and females, their interactions reduced to shallow, mercantile transactions, their words dripping with the calculating cynicism of a world in which love has been reduced to a commodity. The complacency of each social class, their acceptance of their lot in life, serves as a stark testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, a system that reduces individuals to mere ciphers, their agency stripped away by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and obedience.",
            "The years have worn down the miles, four and a half semesters of traversing the sprawling expanse of University Park. A student for nigh on three years now, I've come to know the trials of navigating this campus like the lines on a weathered face. The East Halls, once a distant sentinel on the edge of town, now stand as a testament to the voracious appetite of progress. The vacant lots that once separated the dormitories from the rest of the university have given way to a tapestry of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and apartment complexes. The Creamery, a hub of activity, stands as a beacon, its presence a reminder of the ceaseless expansion that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe land itself seems to stretch on forever, a vast and unforgiving expanse that demands to be traversed. And so I find myself on the move, a restless spirit driven by the need to reach my destinations. The solution, I've come to realize, lies not in the bike itself, but in the resolve of those who would wield it. For in the stillness of the morning, before the day's din awakens, I've found solace in the rhythm of pedaling. The wind in my hair, the sun on my face, and the world unfolding before me – it is a sensation that frees the soul.\n\nA friend, one who'd abandoned the saddle for years, recently took up the practice once more. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so I've taken to the road, a daily commute to Thomas building, a journey that would take an eternity to complete on foot. The minutes tick by like grains of sand, each one a reminder of the preciousness of time. But the bike, ah, the bike – it distills the journey to a mere five minutes, a fleeting instant that leaves me breathless and wanting more.\n\nYet, even this small victory is not without its costs. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a road beset on all sides by the hazards of the world. The bike, a fragile vessel, must navigate the treacherous waters of existence, ever vigilant for the hidden perils that lurk in every shadow. And so I ride, a solitary figure, a fleeting glimpse of movement in a world that's increasingly indifferent to our plight.\n\nIn the end, it's not just a matter of getting from point A to point B – it's a question of existence itself. The bike is a symbol of freedom, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is beauty to be found in the simple act of movement. And so I'll continue to ride, a small voice in the wilderness, a testament to the power of the human spirit to persevere in the face of adversity."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the desolate landscape of human suffering, I have come to understand the imperative of a life devoted to the service of others. The ravaged lives of the forsaken and the downtrodden have stirred within me a burning desire to follow the winding path of the Division of Family and Children Services, where I might shed what little light I can upon the darkness that has beset so many innocents. It is a vocation that speaks to the core of my being, a calling that echoes through the hollow chambers of my soul. The virtues that inform my intentions - service, respect, an unwavering commitment to the higher purposes of our craft, and a dedication to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement - are not mere abstractions, but the very marrow that sustains me.\n\nMy own life's journey has been a winding, circuitous path, beset on all sides by the trials and tribulations of a world in disarray. The ghosts of those I have known and loved, the faces of the forsaken and the downtrodden, have haunted me like specters, their whispers echoing through the chambers of my mind. It was not until I chanced upon a young boy, trembling with fear, that the path ahead of me began to take shape. His story, a testament to the ravages of a world that had failed him, was a clarion call to action, a summons to take up the mantle of responsibility and to strive, with all the strength at my command, to make a difference. And so I set forth, driven by a fierce determination to reclaim the lives of those who had been lost to the void.\n\nThe value of social justice, that most fundamental of human ideals, is one that has long resonated within me. A society that prides itself on the notion of individuality, yet condones the crushing conformity that stifles the very essence of our humanity, is a society that walks in darkness. I have always been drawn to the margins, to the outcasts and the misfits, and it is there, in the crucible of their experiences, that I have come to understand the true meaning of social justice. My own struggles against the forces of oppression, my defiance in the face of convention, have been a testament to the power of the individual spirit, and it is this same spirit that drives me to continue the fight, to continue the struggle against the forces that would seek to silence, to oppress, and to destroy.",
            "In the depths of a world beset by slumber's dark shadows, the complexities of insomnia emerge, a specter that haunts the waking hours. This paper delves into the dual mysteries of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the labyrinthine paths that lead to this affliction. The biological model, a canvas of genes and physiology, paints a picture of inherited traits and medical realities. It views the somnambulant landscape through the lens of inherited characteristics, a legacy of the genes that whisper secrets to the hypothalamus, that most enigmatic of organs. The neurons within its depths, like sentinels of the night, guard the gates of sleep and wakefulness, their whispers guided by the precise cadence of orexin.\n\nA study, conducted in the secrecy of the laboratory, where mice are the unwitting subjects of our inquiry, has revealed the intricate dance of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons. The activation of this receptor, a subtle whisper in the darkness, induces the somnambulant state, a surrender to the shadows. Its inhibition, a silencing of the whisper, yields a contrary effect, a reduced anxiety that ebbs like a receding tide, leaving the sleeper to drift into the realm of dreams. The GABAB agonist, a catalyst for this somnambulant state, has been shown to increase sleep time, a benediction of rest. These findings, though derived from the animal kingdom, hold a haunting resonance for humanity, a testament to the genetic and environmental harmonies that govern our slumber.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research unfold like a tapestry, woven from the threads of inheritance and environment. If the phenotype, that most ephemeral of things, is shaped by the genes that bear our likeness, then an alteration of this delicate balance would disturb the somnambulant state, leaving the individual to stumble through the waking world, a stranger in a land of monotony and fatigue. The impact would be felt in all aspects of life, from the sterile corridors of the classroom to the drab routine of daily tasks, where focus and attention are the only currencies that hold value.",
            "In the labyrinthine passages of the human brain, a disorder lurks, shrouded in the shadows of our most basic perceptions. Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a malady that defies the notion of hearing as a singular, unyielding entity, instead reveals the intricate dance of the central nervous system's (CNS) utilization of auditory information. The CNS, that great and mysterious orchestra, struggles to harmonize the cacophony of sounds, separating the whispers of the wind from the roar of the crowd, yet finding itself confounded by the very task. People afflicted with CAPD, their ears attuned to the world around them, are not deaf, nor do they suffer from the maladies of hearing loss, but rather, their brain's inner sanctum, the temple of perception, falters in its duty to transcribe the symphony of sound.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction, known then as \"auditory imperception,\" date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first began to tread the paths of children beset by communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari took their first tentative steps in 1954, laying the groundwork for the tests that would follow. In 1961, Kimura introduced the dichotic testing, a method that would illuminate the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception, casting a faint glow upon the dark recesses of the human brain. The year 1977 saw a national conference, a gathering of minds that would fan the flames of research into the mysteries of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests its presence in a multitude of forms, its symptoms a labyrinthine tapestry woven from the threads of confusion and disarray. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, their spatial awareness dulled by the din of the world; they may stumble in the darkness, unable to distinguish between two or more acoustic events, their ears ringing with the echoes of confusion. They may falter in their recognition of sound patterns, their brains rebelling against the symphony of sound; they may fail to detect the subtle nuances of speech, the whispered secrets of sarcasm and irony lost upon them. A single sound may be drowned out by the next, a cacophony of confusion that assails their fragile perceptions. They may struggle to synthesize the disparate threads of sound, to weave them into a coherent tapestry, and they may find themselves lost in the sequence of auditory information, their minds stumbling through the labyrinthine corridors of time.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, relies on the systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. The practitioners of the art – audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others – employ a variety of measures to evaluate the auditory-related skills of the afflicted, using questionnaires and surveys to probe the depths of their perceptions. Observation of auditory behaviors, a delicate dance of stimuli and response, provides a glimpse into the workings of the brain, a window into the inner sanctum of perception. Yet, there is no single tool, no one test that stands apart from the others, no panacea for the diagnosis of CAPD. The disorder remains shrouded in mystery, its causes unknown, its symptoms a maddening puzzle that defies solution. The tests used to diagnose CAPD present the afflicted with a series of auditory stimuli, a challenge to their perceptions, a gauntlet thrown down in the arena of sound. The more advanced tests, a deeper probing of the auditory labyrinth, record the acoustic signals within the ear, measuring the responses to the stimuli, a faint echo of the workings of the brain.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Twelfth Night, a lone figure emerges, shrouded in the tattered cloak of deception. Viola, a young woman, dons the guise of a man, a stratagem born of necessity. In a world fraught with danger, she finds herself lost and alone, a fragile flower beset on all sides by the unforgiving winds of chance. Her decision to assume the mantle of Cesario, a man, is a desperate bid for survival, a fleeting respite from the cruel whims of fate.\n\nBut with each passing day, the lines between her true self and her adopted persona begin to blur, like the indistinct outlines of a withered landscape. She finds herself torn asunder by the conflicting desires that arise from her deception. The women she encounters, like Olivia, are drawn to the false Cesario, while the men, like Orsino, are deceived by their own desires. In the crucible of their affections, Viola is forged anew, her very identity reduced to a mere cipher, a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nThe question persists: why does Viola feel compelled to don the disguise of a man? Is it a desperate bid for protection, or a reckless surrender to the void that yawns within her? Her words, like a whispered confession, reveal a darkness that threatens to consume her: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town, where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) In the desolate landscape of her own heart, Viola finds herself lost, a stranger in a strange land, torn between the opposing forces of her own desires.\n\nThe masquerade that has become her life is one of calculated risk, a delicate dance of deception and desire. She navigates the treacherous waters of Orsino's affections, her own desires suppressed, like a fire smoldering beneath the ashes. And yet, in the end, it is not the revelation of her true identity that proves the greatest challenge, but the unraveling of her own heart. For in the end, it is not the world that rejects her, but herself.\n\nAs the characters of Olivia and Orsino stumble through the labyrinth of their own desires, the question arises: what lies beneath the surface of their affections? Is it a genuine love, or a shallow facade, a reflection of the societal norms that bind them? The ease with which Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest, speaks to the vacuity of their desires. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) The words hang in the air, a haunting reminder that in the end, it is not the truth that sets us free, but our own capacity for self-deception.",
            "The shadow of the German colonial yoke lay heavy upon the land, its brutality a stark reminder of the darkness that had befallen the Ovaherero and Nama in the desolate expanse of South West Africa. Yet, to speak of this colonial behemoth as a monolith would be to oversimplify the labyrinthine policies and ruling styles that had come to define it. The colonial empire's educational endeavors, too, were as varied as the shifting sands that swept across its vast domains. In East Africa, where the British would later lay claim, they found a population of Africans steeped in the trappings of civilization - educated, literate, and bearing the hallmarks of a nascent culture. Contemporary authors had praised the German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies, extolling the virtues of a system that had sought to uplift the native populations.\n\nBut in South West Africa, a stark and unforgiving landscape stretched out like a graveyard of dreams. Unlike the East, where the government had taken an active hand in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of enlightenment had been left to the missionary societies, their efforts hampered by the meager support of the colonial authorities. The government, however, had lavished its attention on the education of the European settlers, erecting a network of state schools and lavish institutions that would serve to solidify their grip on the colony. The result was a chasm of educational disparity that would come to define the future of South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German presence had withdrawn. While other colonies boasted of their educated and literate populations, in South West Africa the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unlettered, and lost to the void of ignorance.\n\nThe divergent experiences of South West Africa were the product of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors. It was a confluence of circumstances that would come to shape the very fabric of the colony, a tapestry woven from the threads of settler attitudes and colonial policies. This paper seeks to unravel the tangled skein of these factors, shedding new light on the attitudes of the settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populations, and to explore the labyrinthine paths that led to the educational catastrophe that befell South West Africa.\n\nA wealth of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a body of work that is largely bereft of outsiders. The majority of these sources are bound in German, their pages yellowed with the patina of time. Written in the early years of the 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German rule, they sought to describe the contours of the educational systems that had been established. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies of education in the various colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of the educational endeavor. These studies revealed the yawning chasms that existed between the educational systems of different colonies, highlighting the significant differences that had arisen.\n\nOne of the most stalwart works to address the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's comparative study of the two colonies sheds light on the factors that account for the divergent paths taken by each. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a primary factor in shaping the colony's educational system, a system that would ultimately prove to be a curse upon the native populations.\n\nIn the desolate expanse of South West Africa, the climate was temperate, a rare blessing in a land that was otherwise scorched by the fiery sun. Yet, the European population that had come to call this land home was drawn to it, enticed by the promise of a more hospitable climate. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites had made their home in South West Africa, a number that dwarfed the settler population of East Africa, where only 5,336 had made the desert their home.",
            "In the vast expanse of popular music, a classification has evolved, a taxonomy that strains to encompass the profusion of genres that have burst forth like a maelstrom over the past century. The proliferation of sub-genres within sub-genres threatens to consume the very fabric of understanding, leaving behind a trail of nomenclature that is at once imprecise and overwhelming. The Heavy Metal genre, a behemoth born of darkness and chaos, has proven itself to be the most fecund and mercurial of all, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare the very essence of sound.\n\nIn the span of four decades, Heavy Metal has mutated, its forms shifting like a living thing, adapting and evolving in response to the whims of its practitioners. It is a music of excess, a cacophony of bass and volume and violence, a theatricality that defies the boundaries of the mundane. Those who wield the instruments with precision and skill, their chops honed to a fine edge, imbue their music with a visceral quality that is at once mesmerizing and unsettling. And at the heart of this maelstrom lies a darkness, a void that draws in the lost and the lonely, a siren's call to the disaffected and the disillusioned.\n\nThe 1970s, a decade of psychedelic excess, saw the birth of a new era, one in which the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred, and the music reflected this chaos. The dark, visceral qualities that coursed through the veins of Heavy Metal became a hallmark of the genre, a counterpoint to the sugary sweetness of popular music's more pallid offerings. Later generations of metal purveyors would tap into this wellspring of darkness, drawing upon the Romantic Era's legacy of excess and despair. The lyrics of Helter Skelter, that infamous song from The Beatles' White Album, serve as a testament to the genre's propensity for the macabre and the bizarre. A response to the Rolling Stones' own forays into the heavy and the dark, it marked a turning point in the evolution of Heavy Metal, a declaration of intent that would leave an indelible mark on the landscape of sound.",
            "In the dusty antecedent to the dreamlike canvases of the Surrealists, Henri Rousseau forged his own nocturnal landscapes, his brushstrokes born of longing and defiance. The Dream, a painting of piercing beauty from 1910, was more than a woman enthralled by the wonders of a mystical realm – it was a testament to the artist's own inner turmoil. A man of unyielding passion, Rousseau had spent decades chafing against the yoke of obscurity, his heart afire with the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by those who mattered most. Yet, in the darkest recesses of his soul, he grappled with a cruel dilemma: to surrender to the siren song of conformity, to mimic the styles of his betters and risk losing himself in the process, or to chart his own course, to blaze a trail through the wilderness of art and risk being lost to the void.\n\nTo grasp the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into the unforgiving landscape of Rousseau's life. Born in the rural town of Laval, France, in the year 1844, he was a man of modest beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer who knew the value of hard work and thrift. But the boy Rousseau, unencumbered by the trappings of formal education, was destined for a different path. For forty years, he toiled in the municipal toll service, a gabelou, a man of duty and routine. The label \"douanier,\" a customs inspector, was a moniker he wore with a mixture of pride and resignation. His life was one of quiet desperation, until the cruel hand of fate dealt him a blow: the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and the eight tiny souls who had followed in her footsteps. The only remnants of his shattered world were his daughter, Julia, and the ache of his own grief.\n\nAnd so, he turned to art as a balm, a solace that would ease the pain and offer a glimmer of hope. But his was not the romanticized vision of the peasant, nor the sentimentalized version of the common man. Rousseau's brush danced with the raw, unvarnished truth of his own experience, his own hopes and fears. His was a voice that spoke to the downtrodden, the marginalized, the forgotten. And yet, as he struggled to find his place in the rarefied world of art, he faced a daunting challenge: to be accepted by those who had spent their lives within the rarefied halls of academia and tradition. For in the world of art, there was no room for the uninitiated, no place for the self-taught.\n\nJan Gordon, in his scathing critique of the art world, exposed the chasm between Rousseau and his contemporaries, particularly Matisse. While the latter was driven by a terror of banality, Rousseau's desire was to create a work so conventional, so predictable, that he might be welcomed into the rarefied world of the Artiste Français. But was this not a Faustian bargain, a pact with the devil himself? To sacrifice one's very soul for the fleeting validation of others? The Dream, a painting of haunting beauty, remains a testament to Rousseau's eternal struggle, a battle between the desire for recognition and the need to remain true to oneself.",
            "The connections that bind ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, run deep. It is a notion that has long been pondered by thinkers of the past, a thread that weaves through the fabric of human understanding. John Keats' words, etched in the \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" serve as a haunting testament to this bond: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It is a notion that defies the cold, calculated logic of education and experience, a mystery that cannot be grasped by the rational mind alone.\n\nFor in the realm of ethics and aesthetics, we find ourselves struggling to articulate the unspoken, to put into words the ineffable essence of what makes a work of art beautiful, or a moral act virtuous. We grasp for concepts and frameworks, seeking to explain the why behind the what, but ultimately, these efforts fall short. Critics may dissect the Mona Lisa with precision, analyzing foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, yet in the end, they cannot capture the elusive quality that makes it a masterpiece. It is the whispered phrase that often precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" Something that cannot be reduced to the dry, dusty pages of criticism.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words echo through the silence, a testament to the power of the unspoken: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. We try to pin it down, to reduce it to a set of rules or principles, but it remains a mystery, a transcendental force that defies capture. As Wittgenstein so astutely observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nAnd it is this transcendental nature that binds ethics and aesthetics together. Both are experienced at a level that is beyond the reach of language, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully explained. It is here, in this realm, that we find the connection between them, a connection that is most powerfully evident in the art of literature. For it is in literature that we find the reflection of our own values, our own moral standards. As McKean so eloquently put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The land of Germany, a country forged from the unforgiving shadows of the Alps and the sea-kissed shores of the Baltic, stretches out like a vast and storied tapestry. From the storied streets of München, where the Bavarian mountains seem to touch the sky, to the wind-swept coast of Kiel, where the grey sea pounds against the shore, the essence of this land remains a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a cultural mosaic, born of the confluence of disparate influences, a symphony of traditions and customs that echo through the ages.\n\nThe name \"Germania\" - that most enigmatic of monikers - has been the subject of scholarly debate for centuries. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that once dwelled beyond the Rhine, where they clashed with the Gauls in a maelstrom of blood and steel. Others posit that it was Tacitus, the Roman historian, who first coined the term, as a way to distinguish the Germanic tribes from the subjugated Gauls. His writing, penned in the dark of the 1st century, speaks of a land of unyielding warriors, whose ferocity in battle was matched only by their isolation from the world beyond their borders.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are those who suggest that the name \"Germania\" was born of a more prosaic origin - the spear, that most primal of instruments, known to the ancients as the \"ger\". Or perhaps it was the cacophony of battle, the \"garim\" of the Old Irish, a sound that echoed through the valleys and hills, a testament to the fierce and unyielding spirit of a people. The truth, much like the name itself, remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the darkness of the 1st century, Tacitus penned his magnum opus, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", a treatise on the origins of the Germanic people. His words are a testament to the isolation and self-reliance of these early Germanic tribes, who, like the Roman Empire, seemed to exist on the periphery of the known world. \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany?\" he asks, his words dripping with a mixture of awe and disdain. And yet, it was this very isolation that would ultimately prove to be the catalyst for their rise to prominence, as the Germanic tribes coalesced and forged their own identity, their own cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\nFor centuries, the Romans would send their legions into the heart of Germania, seeking to subjugate and conquer. But it was the Germanic tribes who would ultimately prove to be the most elusive of foes, their ferocity and cunning allowing them to evade the Roman grip time and again. And so, they remained, on the periphery of the empire, a thorn in the side of the great powers, their own culture and traditions forged in the crucible of their history.",
            "Downward, my gaze plummeted, unwavering, into the depths of the abyss before me. The view unfolded like a barren landscape, unyielding and unrelenting, yet I regarded it with an empty, almost numb awareness. My mind, a desolate expanse, struggled to find purchase, to grasp the desolate beauty that lay before it. Yet, it was a futile endeavor, for the more it sought to comprehend, the more it slipped through its fingers like sand in an hourglass. My thoughts, a restless procession, darted in and out of my consciousness, leaving naught but a faint echo, a whispered promise of understanding that remained forever out of reach.\n\nIt was in this state of mind that I stumbled upon a tome, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", an artist's counsel that promised to unlock the secrets of creation. I had harbored a child's fascination with drawing since the tender age of six, and this book seemed to hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the visual world. It taught me to frame the chaos, to impose order upon the randomness of the world. The technique, a simple yet elegant one, required me to enclose my subject within a square, stripping away the extraneous, leaving only the essence of the thing itself. And so, in that moment, I stood transfixed, unable to impose this discipline upon the bowl of fruit before me, so overwhelmed by its beauty that I was reduced to a state of awestruck reverie.\n\nAs I gazed, the ghosts of masters past whispered through my mind: Picasso's blue epochs, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to claim the title of artist, then this was my humble beginning, the genesis of \"Work in Brown\". My fingers, hesitant and uncertain, hovered over the pencil, as if unsure of their purpose. And yet, in that moment, I was alive, my will and creativity channelled into the blank page, the promise of creation hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nBut the moment was short-lived. My hand, a mere extension of my will, faltered, and instead of the gentle touch of the pencil, it was the cold handle of the toilet that met my fingers. Water swirled, a tranquil mockery, as I stared at the obstinate bundle of waste, a brown, lifeless thing that refused to yield to my will. I stood, a supplicant, before the porcelain throne, my green tie constricting my neck like a noose. The mop, a trusty companion, hung limp in my hand, a symbol of the Sisyphean task that lay before me.\n\nWith a sigh, I stooped, my hand probing the depths of the toilet, like a diver into the abyss. The sheet of toilet paper, a futile barrier, yielded to my grasp, a feeble protest against the forces of nature. And then, with a jerky, almost desperate motion, I dipped my hand into the depths, a hesitant, almost sacrilegious act, as if I were defiling the very sanctuary of the loo. The water, a cold, unforgiving mistress, closed over my hand, a reminder of the futility of my endeavor, the crushing weight of the task that lay before me.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a grim litany plays out with a sickening regularity: the young, behind the wheel, and dead.  The numbers are a stark and unforgiving testament to the futility of youth in the face of mortality.  The National Institutes of Health paint a picture of a brain in its formative stages, unprepared to reckon with the unforgiving calculus of the highway.  Inexperience seethes, a cauldron of mistakes waiting to boil over, and spill its toxic contents upon the asphalt.\n\nThe silence of the statistics is a more chilling indictment still: the presence of peers in the passenger seat, a toxic cocktail of recklessness and abandon.  A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals the correlation in stark relief – the younger the passenger, the deadlier the statistic.  It is a grim arithmetic that unfolds with each passing year, a grim reminder of the price paid by those who would drive with abandon.\n\nThe provisional licenses, a stopgap measure, a threadbare patch on a gash that gapes wide and deep.  The real issue, the one that festers and refuses to heal, is the simple fact that the young are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with the wheel.  Marvin Zuckerman's research echoes through the void, a chilling reminder that even the age of 18 is too soon, too green, to be entrusted with the keys.  The siren's call of the road, a siren that beckons the young to take risks for the sake of thrill, is a siren they cannot resist.\n\nThe numbers grow, a tidal wave of young drivers, ready to take to the roads, and the death toll rises, a macabre count that swells with each passing year.  By 2010, the wave will crest, a maelstrom of new drivers, each one a potential statistic, each one a life cut short.  The legislation is clear, a straightforward solution to a deadly problem: the young must be kept from the wheel, their inexperience and recklessness a ticking time bomb waiting to detonate.\n\nSchools can offer the classes, the lessons, the theory, but the wheel is a different beast altogether.  A beast that requires experience, and patience, and a maturity that comes with age.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone, a bridge to the full license, but one that must be earned, not handed out like candy.  The hours, the training, the practice – all of these must be rigorously enforced, a gauntlet that the young must run before they are deemed worthy of the wheel.  Uniform, national legislation, a beacon of hope in the darkness, a chance to stem the tide of death on America's roads.\n\nThe idea is not new, but it is one that must be repeated, a mantra, a call to action, until it is done.  The young must be protected, not from the road itself, but from their own impulses, their own recklessness.  For in the end, it is not the road that kills, but their own hand, their own desire to take the wheel, and drive, and die.",
            "The dusty tomes of the Library of Congress held within their yellowed pages the ghosts of Edison's earliest cinematic endeavors, a collection of trick films that danced on the cusp of reality and illusion. Fifteen of these wraiths, born between 1895 and 1901, beckoned me to unravel their secrets. My inquiry, a descent into the heart of this nascent art form, led me to probe the poetics that governed the majority of these trick films, as well as to inspect the anomalous characteristics that began to emerge in the later specimens.\n\nIn the early days of cinema, the trick film was bound by the strictures of its theatrical past. Composed within the rigid frame of a frontal proscenium, these films eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead relying on the static, the unyielding. The camera stood sentinel, a steadfast observer, as the world within the frame unfolded like a tableau. The long shot and the medium shot reigned supreme, their dominance a nod to the theatre and the vaudeville traditions that had given birth to this nascent art form.\n\nBut even as the camera remained stationary, the figures within the frame seemed to move, their steps measured and deliberate. In films like Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their movements constrained to the horizontal axis, as if bound by some unseen force. And when they vanished from view, the camera remained steadfast, unmoved by their absence.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, with its emphasis on the long shot and the medium shot, foreclosed the possibility of the close-up, that most intimate of cinematic encounters. The actors, like puppets on a string, remained at a remove from the viewer, their faces and gestures frozen in a tableau that might have been plucked from the stage. This was a cinema of spectacle, of wonder, where the audience was invited to marvel at the conjuror's art, not to be drawn into the inner lives of the performers.\n\nThe one-shot rule, that most fundamental constraint of the trick film, limited these early efforts to a brevity that was almost ... temporal. Most trick films clocked in at under a minute, their narrative and dramatic possibilities circumscribed by the need for a single, unbroken shot. And yet, even within this narrow framework, the filmmakers found ways to deceive the eye, to conjure the impossible. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a masterful example of this art, the moment of Mary's beheading is revealed to be a clever trick, a joining of disparate shots that create the illusion of a seamless, unbroken motion.\n\nIn these early trick films, we find the seeds of a medium that would eventually flower into a full-blown art form, one capable of capturing the world in all its beauty and complexity. But in their static, frontal proscenium style, we also find the echoes of a bygone era, a world where the boundaries between reality and illusion were still fluid, where the camera was a tool of wonder, not a window into the human heart.",
            "In the scorched landscape of the early American republic, a figure emerged, his name etched in the dust like a testament to the unyielding convictions of a bygone era. John Taylor of Caroline, a zealot for the cause of Republicanism, left an indelible mark on the soil of his time. Though his occupation as an agriculturalist may have seemed a far cry from the cutthroat world of politics, it was this very profession that forged his unwavering dedication to the principles of personal freedom and government.\n\nThe agrarian ethos that defined his existence served as the bedrock upon which his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system were built. His abiding passion for the preservation and promotion of a simpler, agrarian way of life colored his every argument, a testament to his unshakeable faith in the virtues of the land and the people who toiled upon it.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States stood poised at the threshold of a rare opportunity, one that allowed its founders to craft a system of self-government unfettered by the weight of tradition. He saw in this a chance to create a society that would temper the natural inclinations of humanity, to harness the baser elements of human nature and redirect them towards the greater good. The notion of a \"state of nature,\" he argued, was a cruel reality in which the strong preyed upon the weak, their malevolent intelligence and physical prowess insidiously eroding the fabric of civilization.\n\nIn order to build a society that would transcend this bleak vision, Taylor posited that government must be crafted to account for the inherent duality of human nature. He was unyielding in his adherence to a dualistic morality, one that saw the world in stark relief: good and evil, virtue and vice, were not abstract concepts but living, breathing realities that informed every aspect of human existence. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he declared, \"all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined the good principles of a just society as those that protected private property, fostered agricultural prosperity, and checked the corrosive influence of capitalism. A government founded upon these principles, he believed, would endure regardless of the avarice and self-interest that inevitably guided its administration.\n\nYet, Taylor was not naive to the nature of human motivation. He acknowledged that self-interest was the driving force behind all human action, but he saw it as a necessary evil, one that must be harnessed and directed towards the common good lest it devour the very fabric of society. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this darkness, to keep it in check and prevent it from consuming all in its path.\n\nIn the realm of politics, Taylor's strict construction of the Constitution was a beacon of conviction. He advocated for a limited Federal government, one that was bound by the explicit language of the Constitution and denied any authority that lay beyond its purview. He knew that an expansive Federal government was a recipe for despotism, a Frankenstein's monster that would devour the very liberties it was intended to protect. Yet, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution was a recipe for disaster, a method that would lead to corruption and abuse of power. In this, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, a document that more eloquently captured the essence of a nation forged from many sovereign states rather than a single, monolithic entity.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in submissions to the commuter log emerged, a disheartening turn of events that left us grasping for answers. The onset of winter at our New England campus, with its icy grasp and shortened days, had doubtless claimed a portion of the decrease, as the once-familiar rhythms of bicycle and foot traffic dwindled to a trickle. And then, of course, there was the end of the fall semester, that fleeting moment when the campus teemed with the frenzied activity of students scrambling to complete their schoolwork, processing the weight of their grades, and bidding a hasty farewell to the warmth of fall's fading light. In the mayhem of December, the commuter log, once a steadfast companion on the daily commute, seemed to vanish from the radar screen of our participants. The holiday season, with its month-long reprieve from the rigors of academia, further contributed to the decline, as students and faculty alike retreated from the campus, their absence a stark reminder of the project's waning momentum.\n\nAnd yet, even as the winter's chill deepened and the semester's final gasp gave way to the stillness of January, the log submissions remained stubbornly low. We might have expected, perhaps, a natural ebb and flow to the project's energy, a dip in enthusiasm as the initial fervor gave way to the routine of daily life. But the Carpool Challenge Week, our hastily concocted remedy to reinvigorate the initiative, brought a glimmer of hope, as the log submissions surged in March, a fleeting promise of renewed vitality. Still, the underlying challenges remained: the project's momentum, buffeted by the twin headwinds of holiday and semester breaks, struggled to stay aloft.\n\nA deeper truth, too, lay at the heart of our struggles: the siren's call of freedom, independence, and flexibility that beckons us to the open road, that most American of myths. For in our culture, the car is an extension of self, a symbol of autonomy and power. To expect people to abandon this hard-won freedom for the restrictive rhythms of alternative modes of commuting was, perhaps, a fool's errand. And so, we offered our participants a series of incentives, a scattering of gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, and bookstores, a paltry compensation for the surrender of their cherished independence. The prizes, though generous, remained static throughout the project, a constant in a world of flux. Would it not have been wiser, perhaps, to offer a series of escalating rewards, a tantalizing prospect of greater prizes to come, a bicycle, a hybrid car, or even an electric car, a siren's call to participation that would have echoed across the campus, a clarion call to abandon the familiar rhythms of the open road for the promise of a new, greener way of commuting?",

The siren song of low expense ratios beckons, a promise of thrift and prudence, while the whispered warning of commissions stirs, a reminder that even the most judicious of investors must pay the piper.\n\nBut make no mistake, the allure of ETFs is not without its costs.  For in the bleak landscape of finance, where the wolves of risk howl with equal ferocity, the ETF IHF stands as a sentinel, its top ten holdings a concentrated essence of the entire basket.  We shall examine these holdings, these stalwarts of the ETF's portfolio, and subject them to the pitiless scrutiny of reason.  Are they truly representative of the entire entity, or do they mask the feeble heartbeat of a few, frail stocks?  We shall determine if the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nTo avoid the crushing weight of an unwieldy examination, we have distilled the ETF's holdings to its top ten, those comprising a mere 63.58% of its total assets.  Yet, in these few, we find the essence of the whole.  Below, we present the top ten holdings, their proportions of the ETF's assets a cold, unforgiving truth.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks to the ETF IHF, we shall subject them to the unforgiving calculus of Beta and Return.  The normalized percentages, a stark and unyielding truth, reveal a startling reality: a portfolio comprising only these ten holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a 16% increase in returns that hovers like a raven on the edge of the abyss.  And the Beta, that measure of risk, is a mere 0.12 lower, a whisper of hope in a desolate landscape.\n\nYet, the siren song of statistical significance beckons, a warning that these findings may be naught but the product of chance.  We must subject the standard deviation of each stock to the pitiless scrutiny of reason, normalizing their proportions to reveal the accumulated standard deviation of the ten.  Only then can we determine if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different, or if they merely whisper to each other in the darkness of chance.",
            "The shadows of dreamland, a canvas upon which Edgar Allan Poe daubed his darkest hues. In this sombre tapestry, the name \"Thulé\" reappears like a specter, its source meandering through the labyrinthine corridors of Virgil's ancient verses. But one must not be swayed by the whispers of the past, for the true provenance of this term lies in the fertile soil of Goethe's creative mind. Poe, that devourer of German literature, would have been well acquainted with the master's works, his words seeping into the marrow of the American poet like a slow-moving fever.\n\nA perusal of Karl J. Arndt's meticulous tomes reveals the unsettling similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon\", a doppelganger of creative endeavour that belies the notion of coincidence. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of the inscrutable \"Faust\", that towering monolith of poetic drama, its second part a maelstrom of sorrow and loss. Within its pages, a cursory glance reveals the tragic tale of the King of Thulé, a monarch consumed by the very abyss of grief, his love for his departed queen a burning pyre that reduces all to ashes.\n\nThe lines blur and blend, like the ebbing tide, as we find ourselves in the haunted landscape of \"Dream-Land\", Poe's sorrowful wanderer lost in a world devoid of colour, a world echoing the desolate whispers of Goethe's own \"King of Thulé\". The parallels are striking, a shadowy doppelganger of loss and longing, a testament to the transatlantic currents that flowed between these two masters of the dark arts. The echoes of Goethe's verse, like the faint whispers of the wind, seep into the very fabric of Poe's work, a subtle yet unmistakable signature that speaks to the debts of literary kinship.\n\nIn the twilight world of literary endeavour, the connections are many and multifaceted, a complex web of influence and admiration that binds these two titans together. Poe's reverence for Tennyson, a bridge that spans the Atlantic, assures us of his familiarity with the German master's works. And so, we find ourselves in the presence of a literary unconscious, a realm where the boundaries of time and space are blurred, and the spirits of the past converge to form a tapestry of shared endeavour.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of California's jurisprudence, a question lingers: can a customer, mangled by the cruel fate of slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store's aisles, lay claim to punitive damages? The store manager's callous indifference to the danger that lay at his feet, a danger he had been warned of twice, yet allowed to linger for nigh on thirty minutes while he indulged in a solitary repast, serves as the crux of the inquiry.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. For a plaintiff to prevail in such a claim, they must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were born of a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others, and that such conduct was indeed despicable. Palmer will argue that Martin, the store manager, ought to have known the perils of leaving the spill unattended, given the litany of similar incidents that had befallen his customers in the preceding months. Despite this knowledge, he chose to ignore the danger, a decision born of a callous disregard for the well-being of those who frequented his store.\n\nThe argument that Martin's actions were despicable, though less persuasive, remains a tenable one, given the stark reality of six slip-and-fall incidents in the year 2009, each one a testament to the manager's failure to prioritize the safety of his store. On that fateful day, October 13th, 2009, at the stroke of five in the evening, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, apprised his manager, Paul Martin, of the applesauce spill. Martin's response was a studied indifference, a flippant dismissal of the customer's plight. Fifteen minutes later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, echoed Wayne's warning, only to be met with the same callous disregard. And it was at this juncture, at 5:30 pm, that Jennifer Palmer, a hapless customer, slipped and fell, her back shattered by the cruel fate that had been ordained.\n\nPrior to Palmer's calamity, five similar incidents had befallen D&D's customers, a litany of slip-and-fall incidents that spoke to the store's woeful neglect of its patrons' safety. Now, Palmer sues D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and the question lingers: will the court grant her a hearing for punitive damages, or will the defendant's callous indifference be summarily dismissed?\n\nIn California's code, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant's conduct was marked by oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The courts have long held that conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights, when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions, and deliberately chose to ignore them.",
            "It has been nigh on four years since I beheld the teachings of Islam within the hallowed halls of CBC. The discourse that swirled about the faith was a maelstrom of polemics, with some pronouncing it a creed of hostility, while others extolled its virtues. The question, it seemed, remained as pertinent as ever, its relevance kindled anew by the conflagrations of 9/11. The media, once a crucible of scorn, had transformed into a vessel of unbridled tolerance, and I dared not hazard a guess as to whether this metamorphosis was a product of the times or a deliberate design.\n\nAs I pored over the biography of the Prophet, I found myself enthralled by the dichotomy between the man and the myth. My understanding of Muhammad's life had been premised on the notion that he was a warrior, a conqueror who compelled the faithful to submit. Yet, the biography presented a figure of quiet humility, a man beset by adversity and misunderstanding, who sought not to dominate but to persuade. The tale of his triumph, it seemed, was one of gentle persuasion, as one by one, the people of the desert came to recognize the truth in his teachings.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad were striking, and I could not help but be struck by the similarities between their miracles. The tale of the mutton and milk, wherein the Prophet multiplied the meager provisions to satiate the hunger of forty men, was a testament to the power of faith. And yet, I could not shake the feeling that the authors' intent was to present Muhammad as a figure of quiet authority, a man whose very presence was a testament to the truth he espoused. This, to me, was a perversion, a theft of the very essence of Jesus' message.\n\nThe stories that populated the biography seemed to follow a pattern, a litany of witness and testimony, designed to illustrate the authenticity of the Prophet's words. Yet, the very fact that these stories were often third-hand, filtered through the prism of a countless number of narrators, only served to erode their credibility. It was as if the authors sought to create a sense of communal validation, a chorus of voices that echoed the Prophet's message, rather than allowing the truth to speak for itself.\n\nIt was this very attempt to exalt Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – a man of unimpeachable character, humble and wise and gentle – that struck me as the most egregious error. For history, it seemed, painted a far different picture, a portrait of a man driven by ambition and a desire for power. And I could not help but wonder, do those who follow the Prophet today truly grasp the complexities of his rise to power, or do they see only the myth, the sanitized version of a man who has been reduced to a mere icon?",
            "The fading embers of Jesus' teachings, the faint whispers of his words, were soon lost in the maelstrom of Christian thought that churned forward like a dark and unforgiving sea.  As we scan the jagged horizon of history, a trend emerges - Christianity straying further and further from its origin, like a river that has lost its course.  The world today is ablaze with an awareness, a hunger for something more, a progressive yearning that cannot be ignored.  But the traditionalists cling to the familiar, their minds fixed on the dogma that has been drilled into their souls, resistant to any notion that dares to challenge the status quo.  Yet, even they cannot stem the tide of change.  For in the depths of Christian history, a stirring is taking place.  A growing awareness of the vast chasm between the doctrine that has been layered upon the faith and the fundamental intent of its namesake.  It is a reckoning that will not be stilled.  Decades, centuries may pass, but the outcome is inescapable - a great reversal, a turning back of the clock, a stripping away of the accretions that have accumulated like the detritus of a forgotten civilization.  The layers will be shed, one by one, until only the raw, unadulterated essence of Jesus' message remains.  When this reckoning sweeps through the land, the United States and Europe will be transformed, their populations drawn back to the wellsprings of the faith, worshipping as if the ages had rolled back, following only the path that Jesus laid out.  The church, a bastion of tradition, will remain, but its role will be to guide the faithful back to the wellspring of the faith, not to impose its will.  And as the tide of change washes over the world, the diversity that has long characterized Christendom will give way to an increasing uniformity, a return to the simplicity and unity that marked the early days of the faith.  It is a phenomenon that has played out before - the persecuted Christians of old, the Roman Empire that once shunned them, now a bastion of Christianity; our own nation, born of slavery, now led by the descendants of those once subjugated.  And so it will be with the great reversion that is to come, a return to the source, a stripping away of the extraneous, a rediscovery of the true essence of the faith.  This reckoning will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as the literal pronouncements of a divine being, but as the metaphorical teachings of a wise and compassionate soul.  And so we are left to ponder - what has been done to the faith since the lifetime of Jesus?\n\nLooking far back into the mists of time, we find only Judaism, the primordial spark that ignited the flame of Christianity.  A faith born of monotheism, of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans claimed Jerusalem as their own in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people were already rent asunder by internal divisions - the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the common folk, each with their own understanding of the divine.  The outlines of a faith that would one day become the foundation of Christianity were already discernible, like the first tentative sketches of a work of art.  But the true form, the essence of the faith, remained elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned to those who would follow.",
            "The great and festering rot of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a paean to the abyss that lies at the heart of our species. Here, in the desolate landscape of Packingtown, the grotesque manifestations of our baser impulses writhe and twist like some noxious, living thing. The factory owners and managers, those gatekeepers of industrial progress, care not a whit for the ravages they inflict upon the earth or the suffering they bring upon those who toil beneath their heel. Theirs is a vision of unrelenting exploitation, a calculus of greed that reduces all else to mere abstraction. The factory itself, a behemoth of black steel and smoke, belches forth a noxious plume that hangs like a pall over the city, a grim testament to the cost of their avarice.\n\nAs Sinclair's words conjure the image of those towers, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" we are reminded of the indifference that lies at the heart of their endeavor. The smoke that billows forth, a great river of noxious fumes, is a constant reminder of the damage wrought by their heedless pursuit of profit. And the pens, those abattoirs of animal suffering, churn out their unholy cargo, a tide of feces and urine that stains the earth and poisons the air. All this, and yet the owners and managers care not a whit, their gaze fixed solely upon the bottom line.\n\nTheir employees, those wretched toilers, are nothing more than cogs in the great machine, interchangeable and dispensable. They toil for long hours, their bodies worn down by the ceaseless rhythms of the factory, their spirits broken by the pitiless logic of the ledger. And when their usefulness is spent, they are cast aside like so much rubbish, discarded without thought or remorse. The era in which The Jungle was written was a dark one, a time when the protection of the worker was little more than a distant dream. The laws that governed the workplace were feeble and toothless, and the owners and managers ran wild, their power unchecked.\n\nThe unions, those supposed champions of the working class, proved to be little better, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in lifting the burdens of their brethren. And so the workers, those wretched souls, were trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, their existence a mere fiction, a flickering candle in the void. They were slaves, Sinclair writes, their lives bound to the whims of their masters, their very existence a mere chance occurrence, a fragile thread in the great tapestry of industrial progress.",
            "The litany of authors in their quest to inscribe meaning upon the barren landscape of the reader's soul. Some employ devices, others artifices, to evoke a particular mood, a certain temperament, in the face of the profound. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his sprawling tapestry of a novel, The Great Gatsby, wields such devices with a deft hand. He pairs adjectives with nouns in a manner both jarring and alluring, conjuring an aura about the subject that lingers long after the words have faded from memory. The pairing of disparate terms, a florid adjective with a mundane noun, serves to underscore the artificiality of the world he seeks to reveal.\n\nFitzgerald's inventiveness is perhaps most evident in his deployment of color. He takes the mundane, the pedestrian, and imbues it with meaning, only to later subvert that meaning with a cruel twist of fate. The dichotomy of white and gray, that most pedestrian of duos, serves as the focal point of his endeavor. He bestows upon them a significance that is at once both fleeting and profound. White, a color of purity, of innocence, of the upper echelons of society; gray, a color of decay, of age, of the ravages of time.\n\nThe novel's opening pages are replete with examples of this dichotomy. The characters, a veritable parade of WASPs, are clad in their finest white finery, their very presence a testament to the shallowness of their existence. Daisy and Jordan, those paragons of virtue, are forever \"in white\" – a state of being that is at once both aspirational and suffocating. The landscape itself is not immune to this phenomenon, with the city's \"white chasms\" serving as a stark reminder of the gulf between the haves and have-nots. Even the most mundane of subjects are not immune to this treatment, with the city's \"gray names\" and \"gray land\" serving as a constant reminder of the crushing banality of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it is here that Fitzgerald's true genius lies. He takes the reader on a journey, a journey that begins with the creation of meaning and ends with its subversion. The characters, once clad in their finery, are reduced to a mere uniform, a symbol of the emptiness that lies at the heart of their existence. Daisy, once a symbol of beauty and innocence, is reduced to a mere cipher, a thing to be longed for, but ultimately unattainable. The white dresses, the gray haze of her fur collar, all serve as a reminder of the artificiality of her existence, a existence that is at once both captivating and suffocating.\n\nIn the end, it is this dichotomy that serves as the true heart of The Great Gatsby. A world of black and white, of good and evil, of moral certitude, is reduced to a world of gray, of ambiguity, of moral complexity. It is a world that is both beautiful and terrifying, a world that is at once both familiar and strange. And it is here, in this world, that Fitzgerald's true masterpiece is born.",
            "The sun-baked landscape of San Diego County, a land of unyielding fertility, is a testament to the capricious whims of nature. The mild, golden light that casts its benevolent glow upon the land has proven a balm to the crops that thrive here - the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant, succulent leaves of the citrus groves, the emerald broccoli and squash that burst forth from the earth like verdant sentinels, and the delicate, fragrant herbs that dance in the breeze like disembodied spirits. Peaches and lemons, too, ripen upon the trees, their sweetness wafting on the wind like a siren's call. Berries ripen in the underbrush, a secret feast for the birds and beasts that roam this land. And honey, that golden nectar, drips from the hives like the very essence of the sun itself. Peppers, fiery and hot, add a final, piquant note to this symphony of abundance.\n\nBut the market for this bounty is not without its own peculiar rhythms. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture has created a niche, a narrow band of profitability that is fiercely contested by those who would seek to exploit it. The waiting lists for these programs are long, a testament to the unyielding passion of those who would seek to eat from the earth with clean hands. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, the rewards are great indeed - the chance to reap the benefits of government programs, to enhance the very habitat that has given rise to this bounty, and to create a place where the landowner may walk among the crops, a steward of the earth, a guardian of the wild.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not an easy one. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water has given rise to a universe of pests and weeds, a never-ending struggle to maintain the delicate balance of this ecosystem. The labor is intense, a daily battle to outwit the forces of nature, to coax forth the bounty from the reluctant earth. Losses are greater, the margins tighter, the margins of profit razor-thin. And yet, for those who would seek to till this land, there is a deeper reward - the knowledge that they are not merely farmers, but guardians of the wild, stewards of the land, and participants in a grand, unfolding drama that has been playing out upon this earth for untold centuries.\n\nThe land itself is a testament to this history - a parcel of 160 acres, a patchwork of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, a testament to the fragility of the natural world, lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of them endangered, others on the brink of extinction. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, the butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher - all are threatened, all are struggling to survive in a world that seems determined to erase them from the face of the earth.\n\nThis land has been a place of human habitation for untold centuries - a place of Native American ritual and ceremony, a place of settlement and struggle for the early European-Americans who came to this land seeking a new beginning. The original homestead patent that once called this land its own has long since been extinguished, but the memory of those who came before remains, a lingering presence that haunts the land, a reminder of the transience of human endeavor.\n\nI chose this land from a real estate website, a randomly selected plot of earth that seemed to embody the contradictions of this place - a place of fertility and desolation, of abundance and scarcity, of life and death. And I researched the government programs that might assist a small farmer in this endeavor, programs that would allow me to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife, and to till this land with a clear conscience. And I found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be possible, a testament to the power of human endeavor in the face of adversity.",
            "The land of negotiations stretches out before us, a vast and unforgiving expanse where the humblest of travelers is forced to navigate the treacherous waters of differing cultures. Culture, that great and mysterious force, weaves its way through the threads of our being, a tapestry of what we are and what we are not. It is in the shadows, in the silences, that we find its true face - not in the bold proclamations of what it is, but in the subtle nuances of what it is not. To say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to invite the winds of folly to sweep in, to reduce the rich complexity of a people to a paltry caricature. And yet, it is in the understanding of these generalities that we find the first glimmer of insight, a spark that sets the tinder of comprehension ablaze.\n\nTo walk into the heart of a foreign culture is to venture into the unknown, where the familiar echoes of our own rhythms and cadences threaten to drown out the strange and unfamiliar sounds that surround us. It is here that we must learn to listen, to attune ourselves to the cadence of the other, lest we be deaf to the whispers of the culture itself. Study its history, its prejudices, its very essence - for it is in this understanding that we may find the key to unlocking the door to a successful negotiation.\n\nBut to attempt to change, to impose our will upon this foreign land, is to invite the darkness of misunderstanding to take hold. No, it is better to respect the boundaries, to acknowledge the traditions and beliefs that shape the landscape of the other's world. For in this respect lies the power to navigate the shoals of cultural difference, to chart a course that avoids the rocks of miscommunication and finds the safe harbor of understanding.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular and unyielding force that stretches across the face of the earth. No, it is a many-faceted gem, its facets glinting in the light of our own biases and assumptions. Within the boundaries of a nation, within the corridors of a corporation, lies a world of diversity, a tapestry woven from the threads of individuality and community. A company's culture may speak in the language of long hours and dedication, or in the relaxed cadence of a more leisurely pace. The dress code, the style of communication, the very way duties are delegated - all these and more speak to the unique character of the culture that resides within.\n\nBut it is the values that lie at the heart of this culture, the hidden springs that drive its rhythms and cadences. For it is in the values that we find the why, the underlying motivations that shape the actions of the other. If saving face is a value that is cherished, then the negotiator must tread carefully, lest he stumble into the minefield of cultural faux pas. And if communal harmony is the guiding principle, then the art of compromise becomes a delicate dance, a ballet of give and take that requires a deep understanding of the other's position.\n\nTo be a successful negotiator, then, is to be a student of the human condition, to listen with the ears of the heart and the eyes of the soul. It is to seek to understand the other, to peel back the layers of culture and reveal the person beneath. For it is in this understanding that we find the key to unlocking the door to successful negotiation, to charting a course that navigates the treacherous waters of cultural difference and finds the safe harbor of mutual understanding.",
            "In the depths of the soul, a truth lies buried, a conviction that the fool hath said in his heart: \"There is no God.\" This phrase, inscribed in the worn pages of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, serves as the foundation for the arguments of two stalwart defenders of the faith: St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. The task at hand is to unravel the threads of their reasoning, to determine which of these two sages has woven the more convincing tapestry. To do so, we must embark on a journey of assumption, presuming that both Anselm and Aquinas speak of the God of the Bible, for to diverge from this path would lead us down a labyrinth of irrelevance.\n\nIn the silence of the inner sanctum, Anselm's voice whispers of a truth that resides within. His argument unfolds like a dark and winding road, a path that winds through the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, seeking the proof of God within the recesses of one's own soul. He posits that the very existence of God is inextricably linked to our own understanding, that we cannot conceive of a world without Him. The contours of this idea are shrouded in the mists of ambiguity, but its essence is clear: the proof of God lies within the depths of our own consciousness, a truth that requires no external validation. This is the essence of faith, a leap of conviction that transcends the need for empirical evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas strides forth, a beacon of reason in a world shrouded in darkness. He declares that the existence of God is not a mystery to be solved by faith, but a truth to be uncovered through the cold light of reason. His arguments, five in number, are like the stones of a ancient structure, each one a testament to the logical necessity of God's existence. Change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony: these are the pillars upon which Aquinas builds his case, a case that is not based on the whispers of the soul, but on the certainties of the mind. If a puzzle lies before us, incomplete and silent, logic dictates that we can infer the presence of the missing piece, without ever having seen it.",
            "In the withered crucible of ancient time, a prince was born, one who would one day bear the weight of the name Buddha. His existence was a journey through the desolate expanse of the world, a path that ultimately led him to renounce the fetid grasp of the world and find solace in the desolate stillness of enlightenment. His teachings, like a river coursing through the parched earth, gave rise to a vast and sprawling edifice, Buddhism, with its many sects and traditions, each a twisted and gnarled branch on the twisted tree of its ancient roots. And of these, the most austere and rigid of all was Theravada, a nation born of the fierce and unyielding will of its adherents.\n\nAs the centuries ground on, like the slow and relentless march of a sandstorm, the face of the religion shifted and contorted, its features indistinct and worn by the ceaseless forces of time. In the parched and sun-scorched land of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony unfolded like a ritual macabre, a grim reminder of the impermanence that lay at the heart of all things. Monks and laymen alike participated in this somber rite, their faces lit by the faint and flickering light of a distant torch, their souls bound by the unyielding threads of tradition.\n\nBut the Theravada Buddhist community, like a living, breathing entity, had undergone transformations, its doctrine twisted and shaped by the unseen and unnamable forces that had buffeted it over the centuries. These forces, both internal and external, had left their mark, their influence like the faint and ghostly impressions on the surface of a still pond. The internal forces, born of the very marrow of the Buddhist community, had shaped the religion in ways both subtle and profound. The external forces, the hostile and the benign, had, like a slow and patient tide, worn away at its foundations, reshaping its contours and twisting its limbs.\n\nAs we delve into the core of this discussion, we find ourselves in a labyrinth of definitions, a byzantine maze of terms and concepts. The internal and external, the hostile and the benign, these qualifying terms will thread their way through our exploration like a litany, a haunting refrain that speaks to the very heart of the Theravada Buddhist experience.\n\nWe begin with the foundations, the bedrock upon which the edifice of the religion stands. The three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, shine like a triad of cold and unforgiving stars, guiding the faithful through the darkness of the world. The Dhamma, that vast and sprawling corpus of scripture, the Tripitaka, contains within it the three baskets of Buddhist teachings: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, those brief and evocative flashes of insight that speak to the nature of the world. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the disciplinary rules, a codex of conduct that guides the monk and the layman alike through the treacherous waters of the world. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most recondite and abstruse of texts, holds within it the metaphysical secrets of the universe.\n\nThe metaphysical notions that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism are as stark and unforgiving as the desert landscape itself. Anatta, the concept of no soul, like a cold wind that howls through the canyons, speaks to the transience and impermanence of all things. Dukkha, that crushing weight of inherent suffering, hangs over the world like a specter, a reminder of the futility and despair that lies at the heart of all existence. And Anicca, that most insistent and unyielding of truths, speaks to the fleeting nature of all things, a truth that lies at the very heart of the cycle of death and rebirth, that ceaseless and eternal wheel that turns through the ages.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for life are laid out, a code of conduct that guides the monk and the layman through the treacherous waters of the world. For the layman, there are the five precepts, a litany of restraint that speaks to the fundamental nature of the human condition. For the monk, the rules are more intricate and complex, a web of obligations and responsibilities that guide him through the dark and unforgiving landscape of the world.\n\nAt the very heart of Buddhism, like a burning and unyielding flame, lies the concept of the four noble truths. The first truth, Dukkha, speaks to the inherent suffering that lies at the heart of all existence. The second truth, that attachment causes suffering, like a slow and patient tide, wears away at the foundations of the world. The third truth, that suffering can be overcome, shines like a beacon of hope in the darkness, a reminder that even in the most desolate and barren of landscapes, there lies a glimmer of redemption.",
            "The dual nations of the United States and Mexico stood entwined in an unyielding web of rivalry for a span of 57 years, their animosity burning bright from 1836 to 1893, a period fraught with bloodshed and bitter recrimination. The high watermark of this unrelenting enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a conflict whose brutal ferocity would leave an indelible stain on the landscape of history. The United States, driven by an insatiable hunger for expansion, laid claim to the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and desolation.\n\nThe discord between these two nations was sown in the fertile soil of competing interests, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and traditions that had been incubating for generations. The chasm between them yawned wide, a chasm born of the incompatibility of their worldviews, a chasm that would prove as unbridgeable as the Rio Grande itself. It was a rift that would bleed into the very fabric of their relations, a festering wound that would refuse to heal.\n\nThe historical precedent of their animosity is a familiar one, a recurring refrain that echoes through the annals of time. Nations that share a common border, nations that are joined at the hip, are often doomed to a cycle of conflict and recrimination. The United States and Mexico were no exception, their rivalry a microcosm of the larger struggle that would play out across the continent. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41). And it is here, in the shared borderlands of the Americas, that the tensions between these two nations would simmer and boil, a cauldron of competing interests and irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe specter of religious discord haunted the fringes of their relations, a ghostly presence that would refuse to be exorcised. As Sally Frahm noted, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86). It was a divide that would prove as impassable as the deserts of the American Southwest, a chasm that would yawn wide between the two nations.\n\nTheir enmity was a legacy of the animosity that had simmered between their colonial forebears, the English and the Spanish. The distrust that had been sown in those ancient fields would germinate and grow, casting a long shadow across the centuries. It was a burden that would weigh heavily on the relations between the United States and Mexico, a weight that would only be lifted as the tides of history shifted and the passions of the rival nations began to subside.\n\nThe chronicles of their rivalry are a litany of disputes and bloodshed, a tally of 17 incidents that would scar the relations between these two nations for generations to come. Territorial disputes, border raids, and frontier violence would plague their relations, a constant reminder of the simmering tensions that had come to define their relationship. It was a cycle of violence that would only be broken when the United States and Mexico finally came to recognize the futility of their animosity, when the flames of their rivalry were doused by the cool waters of pragmatism and mutual self-interest.\n\nAs Schmitt so astutely observed, \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (1974, p. 109), a shift in the balance of power that would signal the beginning of the end of their animosity. And as the United States's ambitions turned from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rival nations began to find common ground, their relations slowly healing from the wounds of the past.",
            "The weight of it settled upon me like a shroud, fifteen years ago, a darkness that crept in without warning, an illness that had lain in wait, its presence unknown to me until it had claimed me as its own. I was a nurse, then, a profession born of necessity, a shield against the uncertainties of my own childhood. The mantra echoed in my mind, a refrain I had heard since adolescence: \"You'll always find work, for people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of healing, a way to temper the vulnerabilities of my past. Yet, it was not the path of my dreams, for I had once aspired to be a scientist, to unravel the mysteries of the world, or a journalist, to chronicle its stories.\n\nNow, at the age of forty-six, I found myself alone, my bank account barren, my body broken. The Social Security Disability checks that sustained me were a meager lifeline, a reminder of the fragility of existence. Fifteen years had passed, and I had nothing left that was truly mine. Each day was a struggle, an assault on my very being, a constant reminder that security, safety, and self-worth were fleeting concepts. Yet, amidst this desolation, I knew one thing to be true: I would not have endured without the kindness of family and friends, their unwavering support a testament to the power of human connection.\n\nIn the face of disaster, we are not as strong as we believe. It is in these moments of calamity that we discover the truth of our own vulnerability. And it is here that I find solace in the idea that we should not rely solely on the benevolence of a crumbling system, but rather on each other. The notion of rugged individualism, so dear to the hearts of some, is a myth, a palliative for the ailing souls of those who would have us believe that we can weather any storm alone.\n\nOur forebears, those pioneers who traversed the treacherous terrain of the Rockies, did not reach the promised land through solitary endeavors, but through the sharing of resources, the bond of community, and the compassion that fostered it. They knew that in the face of uncertainty, it is not the individual who stands strong, but the collective.\n\nI, too, have prepared for the worst. I have stockpiled supplies, a meager arsenal against the unknown: a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and the faint glimmer of hope that these will be enough. But I know that it is not the accumulation of goods that will see me through, but the threads of connection that bind me to those around me. If you have the means, cultivate a small farm, preserve your own food, and tend a wood stove. But do not forget the most essential ingredient in the recipe for resilience: the knowledge of your neighbors.",
            "In the grand tapestry of life, the thread of evolution weaves its intricate pattern, a testament to the unfathomable complexity of the natural world. The question lingers, a specter haunting the halls of biology, why do organisms unfold as they do? What unseen forces shape the trajectory of their development, guiding the course of their transformation? Since the dawn of modern science, the enigmatic D'Arcy Thompson posited that the zoologist's grasp of organic forms remains as elusive as a mirage on a desert horizon, tantalizing yet forever out of reach. Even now, a century later, the same sentiment holds sway.\n\nThe application of mathematical rigor to the study of mollusk skeletogenesis has, however, yielded glimmers of understanding. Raup and Stanley's pioneering work in 1981 illuminated the path forward, a beacon in the darkness of the unknown. Our investigation seeks to illuminate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum, a journey that wends its way through the labyrinthine corridors of ontogeny and phylogeny. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental inquiry, we aim to decipher the secrets of morphological transformation.\n\nX-radiographic images of Prunum species serve as the canvas upon which our investigation is painted. The skeletal parameters distilled from these images are then inscribed upon the tablets of our software program, CerioShell, a tool akin to a cartographer charting the uncharted territories of the mollusk's form. We have crafted hypothetical shell morphologies, a series of possible trajectories that might have been, and thus shed light upon the boundaries of morphological possibility in Prunum. These findings are to be conjoined with experimental and descriptive studies, a union of disparate threads that shall weave a richer tapestry of understanding.\n\nA shell, that most enigmatic of structures, presents itself as a tube traversing the expanse of time and space, its revolutions – the whorls – a spiral around an axis, the columella, an unseen and eternal core. The speed at which these whorls unfold varies, a tempo that governs the cadence of growth. The sutures, those slender lines separating each whorl, stand as sentinels marking the passage of time. The body whorl, the last and largest of these spirals, holds the apex, the highest point of the shell, while the spire, a tapering column, stretches towards the base, the opposite extremity. The aperture, a gateway to the world, serves as the mollusk's entrance and exit, a portal to the realm of the unknown.\n\nA shell can be contemplated from four disparate perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural, each a unique window onto the mystery of its form. The apertural view, with the opening oriented towards the observer, is the most common, a vantage point that invites the eye to behold the shell in all its glory.\n\nThe whorls, those spiraling coils, can be counted by tracing the first suture, a starting point that marks the initiation of growth. A line drawn from this point divides the shell, and the whorls are enumerated, each one estimated to a quarter turn. This method, a technique akin to charting the constellations on a celestial map, allows us to quantify the passage of time and the unfolding of the shell.\n\nAs the mollusk grows, its shell becomes a series of apertures, each one a portal to a new moment in time, a new space traversed by the animal's steady accretion. The trajectory of these apertures can be plotted, a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This formulation, a language of numbers and symbols, allows us to manipulate the parameters, to vary the tempo and rhythm of the shell's development.\n\nIn this manner, we may peer into the very fabric of life, and behold the hidden patterns that govern the unfolding of form and function. The trajectory of the aperture, a thread of continuity, weaves its way through the tapestry of time, a testament to the intricate and beautiful mystery of evolution.",
            "In the marrow of Indonesia's progress, a frigid chill has set in, its icy fingers grasping for the fragile lives of the young. The neonatal and infant mortality rates, once a stubborn bastion of resistance, have remained static for a full decade, defying the ambitions of a nation striving to reclaim its place among the ranks of the living. The targets of the Millennium Development Goals, once within grasp, now recede like a mirage on a desert horizon. The water and sanitation targets, like a parched traveler, have been quenched, but the waters of child and maternal health remain stagnant, their shores a barren wasteland of unfulfilled promise.\n\nThe statistics, a cold and unforgiving mistress, reveal a tale of partial victories and lingering despair. Seventy-two percent of births now bear witness to the presence of a skilled health worker, but this dubious triumph masks a deeper truth: the midwives, those tentative guardians of life, are often powerless to stem the tide of complications that wash over their charges. The maternal deaths, a grim testament to this failure, stand as a stark reminder that even the most laudable progress can be a thin veneer, a brittle crust that shatters beneath the weight of reality.\n\nIn the rural expanse of Indonesia, the cesarian-section rates hover at an anemic 2%, a stark contrast to the 7% that marks the urban landscape. This chasm, a gulf of inequality, yawns wide, a testament to the entrenched disparities that afflict the nation. The poor, like a shipwrecked castaway, are left to fend for themselves, their access to healthcare services a distant memory, a fleeting dream that vanishes on the winds of poverty.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the abyss of neonatal and maternal care, the question hangs in the balance, a choice between two paths: the one that beckons with programmatic solutions, a siren's call that promises swift results and targeted objectives, but also tempts with the dangers of duplication and fragmentation; or the path that seeks to strengthen the health system, a more arduous journey that may yield slower returns, but one that holds the promise of sustainability and equity.\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, like a tantalizing mirage, draws the eye, promising a quick fix, a magic bullet that solves the problem in a single, well-targeted strike. But the costs, like the weight of the desert sands, are crushing: the diversion of resources, the hemorrhaging of human capital, the cacophony of uncoordinated programs that drown out the cries of the suffering. The danger, like a specter, haunts the fringes of this approach, a ghostly presence that whispers of a future where the poor are left to fend for themselves, their health a distant memory, a luxury reserved for the privileged few.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiar subgenre emerged, characterized by an unyielding attention to detail and an affinity for the aristocracy of the era. Two novels that diverged from this tradition, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, instead opted for an unorthodox narrative path, replete with mystery and an air of the bizarre. This deliberate departure from the expected served to imbue their characters with a depth and complexity that would otherwise have remained elusive.\n\nThe words of Charles Dickens echo through the shadows, a haunting refrain that speaks to the fractured mind of his protagonist: \"And now, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas crowded his mind, like specters from a dark and forsaken place. He seemed to still walk among Sikes and Crackit, their angry voices ringing in his ears, their words an endless litany that threatened to consume him whole. And then, like a mirage on a dusty plain, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and he felt himself being borne away by some unseen hand, his senses reeling in a maelstrom of pain and confusion.\"\n\nIn these novels, the mysteries unfold like a slow-burning fire, often through the lens of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences serve as a window into the depths of Oliver's soul, revealing the dark fears and pains that lurked within. The shooting of Oliver, revisited in chapter 28, becomes a recurring nightmare, a vivid and all-consuming memory that threatens to consume him whole. As he relives the event, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and we are left with the haunting question: who is responsible for his misfortune, and why? The answer, much like the shooting itself, remains shrouded in an impenetrable haze, leaving only the faintest whisper of despair and hopelessness.\n\nThe darkness closes in, a suffocating shroud that threatens to extinguish the last vestiges of light. \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" The words of Dickens hang in the air, a mournful dirge that speaks to the futility of human endeavor in the face of an uncaring universe.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, this sense of powerlessness is palpable, a crushing weight that threatens to break the spirit. The shooting serves as a stark reminder that Oliver is not the master of his own destiny, that the forces arrayed against him are too strong, too insidious to be defeated. And yet, even in the face of this overwhelming despair, there remains a glimmer of hope, a flickering candle that casts a faint light into the darkness.",
            "It was a dusty afternoon, the kind that seems to cling to the soul like a shroud. I had been working at the after-school program for what felt like an eternity, my days a blur of makeshift lesson plans and weary gazes from the elementary-age students who wandered in each day with their own particular brand of desperation. I had a particular fondness for the written word, and so I found myself drawn to the young boy they called Adrian. He was a small thing, no more than eight years old, with eyes that seemed to hold a depth of sorrow I had seen in few others. They told me he struggled with reading, but I soon discovered that it wasn't quite so simple. Some letters he knew, their shapes and sounds etched into his mind like the lines on a well-worn book. Others, however, left him stumbling, his tongue tangled in knots as he sought to pronounce the alien sounds. It was as if the very language itself had betrayed him, a thief in the night that had stolen his understanding.\n\nWe worked together for what felt like an eternity, I and this small, bruised boy. But it wasn't until his mother appeared, a woman with a face like worn leather and eyes that seemed to hold a world of pain, that the truth began to reveal itself to me. She spoke no English, only the soft, melodic language of her people. Our communication was a halting, broken thing, like the staccato beat of a drum on a cold winter's night. And yet, in that moment, something clicked into place. Adrian's struggles, his stumblings, were not the result of some inherent deficiency, but rather a simple matter of unfamiliarity. The English alphabet, once a mystery to him, began to reveal its secrets, and I was left with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of language.\n\nI tell this story, a cautionary tale of the language barrier that separates us, to illustrate the profound obstacles that stand between us and understanding. It is a chasm that yawns wide, a seemingly insurmountable gulf that divides the haves from the have-nots. But I also tell it to suggest that this problem is not always so evident, even to ourselves. We think we know, we think we understand, but the truth is often shrouded in shadows, waiting to be uncovered. In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: one-on-one tutoring, an attentive ear and a gentle hand to guide him through the labyrinth of language. But for the countless others, the answer is far more complicated.\n\nThe dual language system, so touted as a panacea for the language-challenged, is but a single thread in the tapestry of solutions. It is a fragile, tenuous thing, a thread that may snap under the weight of expectation. And yet, it holds within it the seeds of hope. For in its gentle, patient approach, we find the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs have been shown to outperform their peers, to flourish in a world that often seems determined to stifle them. But we must not be fooled into thinking that this is a simple solution, a magic bullet that will somehow solve the problem overnight. It is not.\n\nWe must approach this challenge with caution, with empathy, and with a deep understanding of the complexities that lie at its heart. We must recognize that the language barrier is not something that can be bridged with a single solution, but rather a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted approach. We must have faith in the power of the human spirit, in the capacity for language to heal and to connect us, even in the darkest of times. And we must be willing to walk the long, winding road that lies before us, with all its twists and turns, its triumphs and setbacks.\n\nThis, then, is the question: how do we bridge the chasm that separates us? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual, to be linguists and diplomats and miracle workers, all at once? No, that would be an unreasonable expectation, a bridge too far. But we can, and must, provide them with the tools they need to navigate this complex landscape. We can, and must, provide them with bilingual aids, with tutors, with whatever resources they need to unlock the doors of understanding.\n\nThe solution lies not in a single answer, but in a thousand small, incremental steps. It lies in the quiet, patient work of teachers and tutors and caregivers, who toil in the trenches, day after day, to bring forth the hidden talents and abilities of their students. It lies in the recognition that language is not a static thing, a fixed entity that can be learned and mastered, but rather a dynamic, living, breathing creature that must be nurtured and coaxed into being. And it lies, finally, in our willingness to listen, to hear the language of the heart, and to respond with compassion, with understanding, and with a deep and abiding commitment to the beauty and power of the human spirit.",
            "From the earliest dawn of our existence, a whispered promise has been whispered into our ears - a cold wind that stirs the trees of our souls, beckoning us towards the unattainable. Some seek solace in the hallowed halls of Sunday school, while others prowl the musty aisles of Temple, or delve into the dark recesses of their own innermost selves in search of answers. Many cling to the worn and weathered truths of their forebears, while a few reject them outright, scorning the notion that there lies something beyond the narrow confines of our individual domains. We chase the shadows, grasping for a fleeting glimpse of something greater, a light to guide us through the dark and into the desolate vastness of an uncertain future.\n\nMy father's eyes, like two worn stones, gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight, the droplets hammering against the tin roof above us like a dirge. We sat on the porch, the gutters overflowing, drowning the parched earth and withered plants that clung to the edge of our domain. The air reeked of smoke and damp earth. His thin frame, gaunt and worn, seemed to sag beneath the weight of his own mortality. His hair, once a wild tangle, now lay sparse and still, a testament to the ravages of time. I felt the weight of his silence, the unspoken words that hung in the air like a challenge. I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and leaned back into the creaking chair, our bodies a fragile barrier against the encroaching darkness.\n\nHe passed five days after my twenty-second birthday, in the cold grasp of December's bitter chill. The poison and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but what price had been paid for these fleeting months, I could not fathom. What kind of deity would orchestrate such a cruel symphony? I lay awake in the dead of night, my breath a whispered curse. If there was a god, I thought, he had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas.\n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his final passage, to see the light flicker out of his eyes as the life drained from his frame. I could not watch the man who had given me life slip away, his essence dissolving into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he became. And so, I waited, curled into a fetal ball, as the hours ticked by like grains of sand in an hourglass. No one came to claim me, no soft words to ease the ache in my heart.",
            "The Gothic novel, a term freighted with the contradictions of the old and the new, strains against the boundaries of definition. It is a genre born of oxymoron, a marriage of the antiquated and the modern, as Ian Watt so astutely observed in his account of its rise. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and dissected, its very essence subject to the whims of literary fashion. And yet, despite the capricious nature of critical opinion, the Gothic novel persists, its appeal lying in the dark, terrible beauty it evokes. Edmund Burke's notion of the \"sublime\" finds its perfect corollary in the Gothic's somber, haunted landscapes, where the shadows of the past converge with the anxieties of the present.\n\nIn Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the ur-text of the Gothic novel, we find the germination of this peculiar alchemy. Walpole, a master of theatricality and mimicry, wove together the disparate threads of ancient romance and modern narrative to create a new and singular form. The \"Gothic Story,\" as he called it, was a deliberate anachronism, a pastiche of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition. And yet, in its very anachronism lay its power, a power that would endure for centuries, even as the world around it underwent a radical transformation.\n\nThe Gothic novel's debt to medieval chivalry is particularly noteworthy. The ideal of the knight, with its attendant values of honor, bravery, and courtesy, was a potent symbol of a bygone era, and one that Walpole and his fellow writers saw as increasingly lost in the present. In The Castle of Otranto, this ideal is embodied in the character of Frederic, a prince of unimpeachable virtue, whose sufferings and travails serve as a commentary on the decay of chivalric values in a world gone awry. The description of Frederic is a tour-de-force of Gothic excess, a hyperbolic portrait of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that sets the tone for the entire genre.\n\nIn the midst of a society torn asunder by politics and strife, Walpole's writing becomes a cri de coeur, a lament for the loss of a bygone era of moral certitude. The Gothic novel, with its emphasis on the \"terrible sublime,\" becomes a means of negotiating the abyss between past and present, a bridge of darkness and despair that spans the chasm between two worlds. And it is in this darkness, this abyss, that we find the true power of the Gothic novel, a power that continues to haunt and fascinate us to this day.",
            "In the vast expanse of commerce, a hidden web of processes unravels, a silent dance of goods and materials from the raw, unyielding earth to the eager hands of the consumer. This opaque tapestry is the supply chain, a labyrinthine path that weaves through stages of production, supply, and distribution, each step a deliberate gesture towards the satisfaction of the customer's insatiable hunger.\n\nIt was in 1982 that Keith Oliver, a sage advisor, first coined the term supply chain management, a phrase that would come to define the intricate ballet of planning, implementation, and control that governs this secretive realm. The six sacred elements of the supply chain – production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information – are the pillars upon which this edifice stands. The managers of commerce, those masters of the obscure, utilize these elements to provide their customers with a service that is at once swift, efficient, and attentive.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this grand process, is the very foundation upon which the supply chain is built. It is here that the stage is set, the when, why, where, and how of creation determined. The market, that capricious mistress, holds the key to understanding the desires of the customer, and it is from her whispers that managers glean the knowledge necessary to chart their course. With the market's counsel in hand, they decide what to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce it, ever mindful of the customer's insatiable thirst.\n\nThe location of production, that crucial decision, is not taken lightly. Managers must weigh the pros and cons, pitting volume against quality, all the while keeping the customer's satisfaction paramount. And once the location is determined, the focus shifts to scheduling, to the careful allocation of workloads and the maintenance of equipment. Every detail, no matter how seemingly trivial, holds the power to make or break the supply chain, to reap a bounty of time and money, or to sow the seeds of ruin.\n\nI recall my own time in the retail trenches, at the hallowed halls of Wal-Mart and Target, where every step, every gesture, was choreographed with precision, from the design of the employee's uniform to the receipt of shipments. The benefits of such planning are legion: a company that moves with purpose, unencumbered by the weight of confusion and misdirection.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is supply, that vital element that governs the very fabric of the supply chain. Here, managers must make strategic decisions, weighing the costs and benefits of core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A single product may require multiple divisions, each with its own unique equipment, workers, and specializations. The manager must decide which division is best suited to each process, all the while keeping the customer's needs at the forefront. And should the need arise, the manager may choose to outsource, to partner with other companies, in the pursuit of velocity – that elusive quality of providing flexibility and quality at a reduced cost.",
            "The sign creaked in the wind, a splintered message scrawled across its weathered surface: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". A solitary figure stood beneath it, a young woman with a face worn by the weight of the world. Ellen Page, a fleeting name from a distant land, held aloft the makeshift placard as if it were a beacon in a desolate landscape. The words, penned in hasty scrawl, seemed to mock her from the page like a cruel jest.\n\nBurma, a land shrouded in shadow, was a nation ruled by an iron fist. A junta of ruthless men, their faces twisted by the lust for power, had seized control in a bloodless coup. The date was etched in history as 1962, a year that marked the beginning of an era of unyielding oppression. The people, their voices silenced by fear, were forced to endure the whims of their oppressors.\n\nIn 2007, a flicker of defiance flared to life. Monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope in a sea of darkness, took to the streets to protest the injustices they had suffered for so long. Their cries for freedom fell on deaf ears, however, as the military junta responded with brutal force. Monasteries were reduced to rubble, foreign journalists were imprisoned and silenced, and the streets ran red with the blood of the innocent.\n\nThe death toll, a number that would only grow with time, was a mere whisper of the true horror that had unfolded. Colonel Hla Win, a man who had once been a part of the very machine that had perpetrated these atrocities, now spoke out against it. His words, a testament to the human cost of unchecked power, were a stark reminder of the darkness that lurked within the human heart.\n\nThis was not a new tale, nor was it a unique one. The desire to crush dissent, to snuff out the flames of freedom, had been a constant companion to humanity throughout its messy, bloody history. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had ruled with an iron fist. The Japanese emperors, deified by their people, had led them down a path of self-destruction. And in our own time, the leaders of nations had spoken with the voices of gods, their words dripping with venom and deceit.\n\nFrom the Tiananmen Square massacre to the Rwandan genocide, from the Third Reich to the countless other atrocities that had scarred the face of the earth, the same dark impulse had driven men to commit unspeakable acts. And yet, even as the world mourned the dead and the living trembled with fear, the cycle continued. The desire for power, the lust for control, remained an unquenchable fire that burned at the very heart of humanity.",
            "In the desolate vastness of jazz history, Duke Ellington's legacy stands as a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor. His artistry, a testament to the futility of human endeavor, transcended the confines of time, as his orchestra, a collection of disparate individuals, coalesced into a cohesive entity under his direction. The piano, an instrument often relegated to the periphery, Ellington wielded with a subtlety that belied its importance, his nimble fingers dancing across the keys like a conductor orchestrating the very fabric of reality.\n\nAs a composer, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to craft frameworks within which his musicians could unfurl their talents like a lotus blooming in the desert. He wove intricate patterns, a tapestry of sound that showcased the unique timbre of each player, inviting them to improvise, to weave their own narratives within the fabric of his compositions. And thus, the orchestra, an ensemble of disparate voices, coalesced into a single, unified entity, a symphony of sound that echoed through the ages.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, a paean to the voice as a jazz instrument, stands as a testament to Ellington's innovative spirit. Like a vessel filled with the scent of decay, this early work, through its use of voice to add texture and color, hinted at the depths of his artistry. The deliberate, plodding pace of this twelve-bar blues, a funeral dirge for the conventions of traditional melody, gave way to six choruses, each a variation on the theme of call and response.\n\nThe first chorus, a gentle, melodic whisper, gave way to a raspy, guttural cry, a manifestation of the raw emotion that lay beneath the surface. The muted trumpet solo that followed, a mournful lament, emphasized the bluesy, extended notes that would become a hallmark of Ellington's style. The sweeping clarinet solo, a virtuosic display of agility, was counterpointed by a syncopated piano phrase, a staccato beat that underpinned the entire piece.\n\nThe full band, a riotous explosion of sound, echoed the first chorus, a call and response between brass and reeds that echoed the primal, primeval rhythms of the universe. The climactic fifth chorus, a cacophonous maelstrom of sound, saw the reeds take center stage, their call and response a high-pitched, wailing cry that pierced the heavens. And finally, the sixth chorus, a return to the gentle whisper of the first, saw the voice take on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal, animalistic cry that left the listener breathless.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, a work that followed a year later, Ellington combined his mastery of orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing created a rich, complementary sound, a marriage of voice and instrument that echoed the primordial, elemental forces that shaped the universe. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of Ellington's orchestra, took center stage, his muted trombone introducing the melody like a benediction from on high.\n\nThus, Ellington's legacy, a testament to the transience of mortal endeavor, stood as a testament to the power of art to transcend the boundaries of time and space. His music, a paean to the fleeting nature of human experience, echoed through the ages, a reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the reaches of our mortal grasp.",
            "The void within her lingered, a gnawing ache that refused to subside. It had begun to manifest in her adolescence, a whisper in the darkness, a shadow that trailed her footsteps like a persistent specter. The years had passed, and the hunger remained, a constant presence that seemed to mock her every step. She was 17 now, a threshold of adulthood looming before her, and still the void persisted. It was a hunger that had once been sated by material possessions, but now it had taken on a more insistent form: the desire for connection, for love, for the gentle warmth of another's touch. Yet, she felt an unshakeable detachment from the boys who sought to claim her, their clumsy overtures a farce, a pale imitation of the real thing.\n\nThe days blended together in a haze of quietude, her parents a steady, soothing presence in her life. They were a calm sea, untroubled by the turmoil that churned within her. Their tranquility was a balm to her soul, a reminder that she was not entirely lost. But today was not a day of peace. Her mother's cry pierced the air, a sharp, blood-curdling shriek that shook her to her core. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing, her mind a jumble of terror and confusion. Her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled, broken thing, her body twisted in an unnatural pose.\n\n\"Oh, sweet lord,\" her mother gasped, her voice a threadbare whisper. \"Help me, child.\" The daughter's hand closed around her mother's, a surge of panic coursing through her veins. \"Just get me to the hospital,\" her mother begged, her voice a desperate rasp. The daughter's mind reeled as she helped her mother to her feet, supporting her weight, her own strength faltering in the face of her mother's pain.\n\nThe drive to the hospital was a blur of fear and worry, the scent of disinfectant and sickness hanging heavy in the air. Her mother's face was a mask of agony, her eyes closed in a desperate bid to shut out the pain. The daughter's mind was a jumble of frantic thoughts, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum. What had happened? How had her mother fallen? The questions swirled in her mind like a maelstrom, but she pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctors' faces were a blur of concern and efficiency, their words a distant hum in the background as she helped her mother onto a gurney. They whisked her away, leaving the daughter alone, her mind reeling with fear and worry. Her mother had fallen from a stepping stool, trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. It seemed a trivial thing, a careless mistake, but the daughter knew better. The consequences were all too real, the pain and the fear etched on her mother's face a stark reminder of the fragility of life.",
            "The arid landscape of chronic heart disease and stroke stretched out before us, a desolate expanse of mortality and decay. It was against this bleak backdrop that the Mediterranean Diet, a gaunt and unforgiving mistress, was tested. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a numerical gauge of adherence to this dietary regime, held the key to unraveling the mysteries of its efficacy. Higher scores, a testament to a diet rich in plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and bereft of saturated fats and animal products, beckoned the promise of a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.\n\nPrior studies, like ghostly apparitions, had whispered tales of the Med diet's inverse association with total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial, a fleeting, flickering flame of hope, had shown the Med diet to be a more potent ally in the struggle against weight loss and the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the obese. Yet, the specter of stroke, a dark and silent killer, remained unexamined.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of 121,700 female nurses, 74,886 threads were woven into the fabric of this investigation. These women, aged 38 to 63, unencumbered by the weight of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, were the subjects of a 20-year odyssey. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, the authors computed the aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires, a litany of nutrient intake that echoed through the years. The FFQs, a testament to the women's diligence, were validated, their truthfulness verified by the cold, unforgiving light of medical records and hospital documents.\n\nThe reports of heart disease, fatal and non-fatal, stroke, and death were confirmed, their occurrence leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of this study. In the absence of records, the presence of probable cases, a spectral presence that hung like a shadow, was acknowledged, comprising 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts. The tapestry of this study was further enriched by the inclusion of body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone, each thread intricately woven into the narrative.\n\nTo mitigate the capricious nature of individual variation and distill the essence of long-term dietary intake, the authors calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The resulting tapestry, a rich and complex weave, was adjusted for the confounders that threatened to obscure the truth: age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical sorcery, was employed to unravel the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. The results, a stark and unflinching portrait, revealed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was indeed associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. The 20-year vigil, a testament to the power of this dietary regime, yielded 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile, a select and privileged few, were found to be at lower risk for both CHD and stroke, their fate sealed by a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of 2007, a tempest of fiscal despair beset the United States of America, leaving in its wake a trail of shattered dreams and desolate economic ruin. Unemployment reared its head like a specter, the housing market crumbled to dust, and the behemoths of American industry lay shattered, their grandeur reduced to naught but rubble. As we stand amidst this devastation, we are compelled to confront the question that haunts us still: how did this calamity unfold, and how might we avert its recurrence? The truth, like a cadaverous specter, rears its head: a concatenation of selfish and naive political machinations, which coerced banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into a financial infrastructure as fragile as a spider's web.\n\nFannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC), those behemoths of the financial world, were goaded into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into the toxic abominations known as CDOs and CDSs. And when the borrowers defaulted, as was inevitable, the banks were left with the bitter taste of defeat, their capital reserves laid bare and their coffers drained. The chaos thus unleashed was transferred, like a plague, onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and thence to the economy at large.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown in the Clinton era, in the year 1999, when the President, a man driven by ambition and the lust for power, sought to cement his legacy by relaxing lending restrictions. His aim was to boost his popularity, to bask in the adoration of the masses, and to ensure his re-election. But in his zeal, he set in motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the sub-prime crisis seven long years later. A prescient Steven Holmes of the New York Times penned a prophetic warning in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes foresaw the calamity that would befall the nation, and sounded the alarm: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nAs the years amassed into a gathering storm, the economy teetered on the brink of collapse, threatened by a concatenation of factors. The new and labyrinthine structure of mortgages, replete with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), ensnared the economy in its deadly coils. The U.S. households, and financial markets in general, became mired in a web of debt, over-leveraged and vulnerable to the slightest perturbation in the housing market.\n\nAnd so the housing bubble burst, releasing a maelstrom of destruction upon the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a figure that accounted for fully 30% of the USA's GDP. The behemoths of Wall Street, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender their independence, becoming commercial banks subject to the strictures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those erstwhile titans of the financial world, were left with a mountain of mortgage debt, a staggering $5 trillion, which would eventually necessitate their nationalization in September 2008.",
            "In the depths of a writer's craft, there lies a pitfall so treacherous, it can send readers tumbling into the abyss of boredom or, worse still, driving them to flee in search of more verdant pastures.  This demon is exposition, that insidious force that tempts us to unveil the secrets of our narrative, to spill the beans, so to speak, in a torrent of words that drowns the very essence of our story.  Dr. Merlin's face contorts in a mixture of frustration and dismay as she confronts the page, her eyes scanning the sea of words for a lifeline, a thread to cling to as the exposition threatens to consume her.\n\nFor in the heat of creation, it's easy to forget the sage counsel of 'show, don't tell.'  The words \"Show, don't tell,\" echo through the chambers of her mind, a reminder of the perils of succumbing to the siren's call of exposition.  But still, she finds herself lost in a quagmire of information, drowning in the details of a character's past, their history, their loves, their losses.\n\nExposition, that wily foe, whispers sweet nothings in our ear, tempting us to reveal the backstory, the history, the context.  But it's a double-edged sword, this exposition.  In film, it's the tedious speech of the Ancient Mariner, a core-dump of information that numbs the senses.  In fiction, it's the author's own telling, a voice that, if not checked, can drown out the music of the narrative.\n\nConsider this: a heroine, a beloved, a marriage, a murder.  Two pages of exposition, a paltry two lines of dialogue.  The husband's character, a cipher, a shadow, a mere whisper of his presence in the heroine's life.  But what if we were to breathe life into him?  What if we gave him voice, gave him substance?  We might see in his eyes the depth of his love for her, the way he moves with a quiet confidence, the way he speaks with a gentleness that belies the strength of his character.  We might see in the heroine the way he changed her, the way he enriched her, the way she was drawn to him like a moth to flame.\n\nAnd when he dies, we would mourn his passing, not just as a plot device, but as a loss, a tragedy, a reminder of the fragility of life.  We would feel the heroine's pain, her grief, her loss.  And in that, we would be drawn closer to her, our connection deepened by the bond we shared with her beloved.\n\nIn short, we need to add meat to the bone of the story.  We need to give it flesh, blood, breath.  We need to make the reader care.  For in the end, it's not just about the plot, it's about the people, the characters, the lives we touch, the hearts we break.  And that, that is the true art of storytelling.",
            "I watched the newscast's from Columbus, Ohio, the city's shadows cast long and dark upon the screen. The first, a fleeting glimpse of NBC 4, a broadcast that danced across the air like a moth in flame. It was the thirteenth of August, a day that would leave its mark upon the souls of all who dwelled within these city walls. The lead story, a tale of blood and steel, unfolded like a dark flower blooming in the desert. A man, Shad Hostettler, his face twisted into a visage of malevolence, had brought harm to his wife. The details, scarce as the morning dew, spoke of multiple stab wounds, a life left broken. The anchor's voice, a monotone murmur, barely above a whisper, seemed to imply that this was but a fleeting moment, a brief excursion into the abyss.\n\nThe second story, a whispered rumor of violence, spoke of a young life, Travis Buyers, his name etched into the annals of time, his fate hanging in the balance. A shooting, a brutal and senseless act, had left him critically injured, his future far from certain. The SWAT team, a phalanx of steel and determination, moved in, their presence a testament to the darkness that lurked within the city's streets. But the story, it seemed, was already fading, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanished into the ether, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of its existence.\n\nThe news continued, a relentless drumbeat of violence and despair. A gunshot hole, a blemish on the Med-Flight helicopter, a reminder that even the skies were not immune to the city's brutal grasp. A .22 caliber bullet, a tiny fragment of metal, had pierced the metal beast, leaving behind a trail of uncertainty. A reward, a paltry five thousand dollars, was offered to those who would dare to speak out against the shadows.\n\nThe weather, a mere sideshow, a distraction from the main event, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms, a fleeting respite from the heat that clung to the city like a shroud. The temperatures, a mere abstraction, would remain in the mid to low eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, the natural world persisted.\n\nAnd then, a story that would leave its mark, a tale of robbery and deceit. A Clime Road UDF, a bastion of commerce, had been breached, its defenses breached by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, his presence a fleeting glimpse of something primal and unyielding. The anchor's voice, a monotone drone, seemed to linger on the details, to emphasize the darkness of his skin, as if it were a badge of shame.\n\nA final story, a testament to the city's twisted priorities, spoke of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana, his fate a mere abstraction, a number, three hundred months, a reminder that even in the depths of the justice system, the numbers game was always played.",
            "A bond forged in blood and fire, unyielding and unbreakable. It is this bond that ties two brothers together, a tangle of emotions that cannot be unraveled - love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and all the tangled threads that bind them. In the crucible of adversity, this bond is revealed in all its brutal beauty, its true nature laid bare like the scorched earth after a wildfire. And it is here, in this most dire of circumstances, that the true cost of this bond is paid in full.\n\nTo gaze into the eyes of one's brother is to behold a reflection of oneself, a mirrored image that reveals the depths of one's own soul. It is in the actions, the words, and the consequences of those actions that the true character of a man is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, a desperate bid to escape the crushing weight of their own despair. The landscape around them is a lush, verdant tapestry, a mere backdrop for the tragedy that unfolds.\n\nPride, that most corrosive of emotions, is the thread that weaves throughout this tale. The protagonist's heart is a battleground, a war-scarred terrain where resentment and love clash in a maelstrom of conflicting desires. He had envisioned a brother who would be a mirror image of himself, a companion in arms, a fellow traveler on the path to manhood. But fate, that cruel and capricious mistress, had other plans. Doodle, the younger brother, was a fragile thing, his heart a mere whisper of what it should be. The protagonist's dreams of a brotherly bond, of a shared adventure, were crushed beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAnd yet, even as his heart festered with resentment, a spark of love remained, a flame that flickered in the darkness. For in Doodle's smile, the protagonist saw a glimmer of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest depths of despair, there is always a glimmer of redemption. This is a man torn asunder by his own contradictions, a soul wrestling with the demons of his own making.\n\nIn the end, it is not the outcome of their journey that matters, but the journey itself, the twisted, tortured path that leads to the climactic moment of truth. And it is here, in this moment, that the true nature of the bond between brothers is revealed, a bond that is at once beautiful and terrible, cruel and redemptive.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human mind, a labyrinthine complexity unfolds, a tapestry of thought woven from the threads of perception. As the ages pass, the parlance of description has evolved, a litany of metaphors born from the crude and the refined. We once likened the cerebral cortex to a wax tablet, a crude slate upon which the marks of knowledge were etched. Then to a sheet of papyrus, its pockmarked surface bearing the weight of hieroglyphic knowledge. And further still, to a book, its pages dog-eared and worn from the fingers of countless readers. And now, in the virtual expanse of the modern era, to a computer, its algorithms a cold, calculating heartbeat.\n\nBut these metaphors, like the fleeting shadows on a wall, are mere approximations, their utility bound by the constraints of language. For in the depths of the brain, a primal alchemy unfolds, as sensory impressions are transmuted into electrochemical impulses. The senses, those doorkeepers of the mind, receive the raw material of the world: the gentle caress of a summer breeze, the scorching heat of a desert sun, the sonorous thrum of a guitar string, or the piercing light of a desert star. These impressions are then transformed, refined, and reassembled by the brain's own peculiar logic, a dialectic of bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nIn the former, the building blocks of perception are painstakingly assembled, a mosaic of color, shape, and texture. A black box on a white background, for instance, is recognized through the gradual accumulation of these elementary data points. And yet, it is the top-down processing that imbues this recognition with meaning, that gives the box its significance, its context. For it is through this process that we identify the box not merely as a shape, but as a container, a vessel, a thing.\n\nBut perception is a fleeting thing, a will-o'-the-wisp that vanishes at the merest whisper of distraction. And so, the brain must prioritize, filter out the irrelevant, and focus on the essential. The attention filter, that sentinel of the mind, stands guard, determining which signals are worthy of consideration, which are but fleeting shadows, to be discarded like so many autumn leaves on a winter's wind.\n\nAnd yet, even as the brain filters and prioritizes, it must also store, encode, and maintain the information it receives. There are multiple types of memory, each with its own peculiar logic, its own rhythms and cadences. Sensory memory, that fleeting whisper of the present, gives way to working memory, that brief, shining moment of recall, and long-term memory, that vast, labyrinthine repository of knowledge.\n\nThe encoding of information is a process of translation, a mapping of the raw data of the world onto the brain's own peculiar syntax. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded through its structure, its sound, or its meaning. And once encoded, this information must be maintained, sustained by the electrical impulses that fire through the neural networks, like the steady beat of a drum.\n\nBut how is this knowledge organized, this vast, unwieldy tapestry of thought? The semantic network, a model of the mind's inner workings, posits a web of interconnected nodes, each representing a concept, a meaning, a thing. \"Chair,\" for instance, is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth. And so, the mind's vast, labyrinthine library is revealed, a boundless expanse of thought, where meaning and connection await the curious, the inquiring mind.",
            "In the sterile expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley lays bare the dystopian trajectory of a world enthralled by the siren song of technology and the crushing weight of capitalist excess. A people conditioned to crave the fleeting pleasures of immediate gratification, they forsake the depths of individuality for the shallow comforts of a collective existence. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating a grand farce in which the masses are reduced to pawns, their thoughts and desires shaped to conform to the dictates of a singular ideology.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theo-philosophy, we discern the author's implicit suspicions regarding the perils of emerging systems that spawn and sustain this bleak world. The terminology of Marxism – homogeny, reification, and the like – serves as a litany, a testament to Huxley's prescience regarding the insidious effects of unchecked capitalism. The false consciousness, a concept dear to Marxist thought, is here wielded as a satirical tool, laying bare the ways in which the common citizenry is denied knowledge of their true relations with other classes, their gaze fixed instead on the fleeting pleasures of consumption and indulgence.\n\nThe Delta and Gamma classes, those bound to the drudgery of menial labor, are denied the gift of self-awareness, their desires honed to a razor's edge by the relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia. The World Controller manipulates this docility, orchestrating a grand farce in which the underclasses are bought into an ideology that serves to entrench their subjugation. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces disparate groups to a state of subjugation, is wielded with ruthless efficiency, the ruling classes aping the behavior of their overlords, their awareness of the game's true nature limited to a rarefied few, like Bernard, whose rebellion is as much a product of his own privilege as it is a genuine assertion of individuality.\n\nIn this bleak landscape, relationships between individuals are reduced to the most superficial of levels, the characters themselves little more than cardboard cutouts, devoid of depth or nuance. Love, that most fundamental of human emotions, is an anathema, replaced by the sterile, transactional interactions that pass for human connection in this dystopian world. The males and females, their interactions reduced to shallow, mercantile transactions, their words dripping with the calculating cynicism of a world in which love has been reduced to a commodity. The complacency of each social class, their acceptance of their lot in life, serves as a stark testament to the insidious effects of capitalism, a system that reduces individuals to mere ciphers, their agency stripped away by the relentless drumbeat of consumption and obedience.",
            "The years have worn down the miles, four and a half semesters of traversing the sprawling expanse of University Park. A student for nigh on three years now, I've come to know the trials of navigating this campus like the lines on a weathered face. The East Halls, once a distant sentinel on the edge of town, now stand as a testament to the voracious appetite of progress. The vacant lots that once separated the dormitories from the rest of the university have given way to a tapestry of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and apartment complexes. The Creamery, a hub of activity, stands as a beacon, its presence a reminder of the ceaseless expansion that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe land itself seems to stretch on forever, a vast and unforgiving expanse that demands to be traversed. And so I find myself on the move, a restless spirit driven by the need to reach my destinations. The solution, I've come to realize, lies not in the bike itself, but in the resolve of those who would wield it. For in the stillness of the morning, before the day's din awakens, I've found solace in the rhythm of pedaling. The wind in my hair, the sun on my face, and the world unfolding before me – it is a sensation that frees the soul.\n\nA friend, one who'd abandoned the saddle for years, recently took up the practice once more. His words still echo in my mind: \"Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so I've taken to the road, a daily commute to Thomas building, a journey that would take an eternity to complete on foot. The minutes tick by like grains of sand, each one a reminder of the preciousness of time. But the bike, ah, the bike – it distills the journey to a mere five minutes, a fleeting instant that leaves me breathless and wanting more.\n\nYet, even this small victory is not without its costs. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a road beset on all sides by the hazards of the world. The bike, a fragile vessel, must navigate the treacherous waters of existence, ever vigilant for the hidden perils that lurk in every shadow. And so I ride, a solitary figure, a fleeting glimpse of movement in a world that's increasingly indifferent to our plight.\n\nIn the end, it's not just a matter of getting from point A to point B – it's a question of existence itself. The bike is a symbol of freedom, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is beauty to be found in the simple act of movement. And so I'll continue to ride, a small voice in the wilderness, a testament to the power of the human spirit to persevere in the face of adversity."
